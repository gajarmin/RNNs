[Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dog[Intro]
"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space."
"The mysteries of creation are there."
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky."
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked."
"Prepared for lift off."

[Verse 1: Guru]
I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave, causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another Cee Cipher pulling my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers, little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten percenters, promoting slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds raining down
Holding it down

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply ya with the fire
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumbling through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch something
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

[Hook x2]

 [Intro]
Ohh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style, I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Master Killa]
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stinging while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seeking for a serum, to cure em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, K's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanishedAllow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing

[Intro]
Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous

[Verse 1 : Inspectah Deck]
Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leaving mics with a cast
Causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I
Rebel INS Your Highness Blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U and bust through like a fullback

[Verse 2 : Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife like Bobby Digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins, Wu wins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Blow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens and ear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats
Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking
Fearless niggas get slapped in Manhattan
For rapping, Big Ghost steps off laughing
Ha!

[Interlude : samples]
Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me

[Verse 3 : Raekwon]
Sit back relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
Putting fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
Tie up, your black Nike's and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners
What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify laying in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Clingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infra-red guard your beam, so seek nuff respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving mash'allah
Pro black like tar
Designing the fly shit and stay shining
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pulling out Macs for fun

[Verse 4: GZA/Genius]
The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguing MCs, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid and nobody knows
How we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producing data, microchips of software
Underground and off air
The Land of the Lost, notorious henchman from the North
Striking niggas where the Mason-Dixon line cross[Intro]
I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in

[Hook: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

[Hook: Life]
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (x2)

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

[Hook][Dialogue from "The Usual Suspects"]
There's no coke
What
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke
I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing
Nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's assassination day, I stalk

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

[Verse 2: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

[Hook][Verse 1: Method Man]
Apocalypse Now, mind over matter
Next batter be Tical, put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now, follow me the Mister
Mef Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone, with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, finger itchy like lice, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like *long inhale*

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As God Cipher Divine, all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel? Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist, you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Mind arson, my squadron surround the SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent, Range whipping, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, suplexed off the rope, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut colored shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in Osh Kosh, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Häagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
INS Your Highness
Wu Tang, 7L
Eso, let's Go

[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]
Bustin' ain't nothin' to us
I spit game like a sportscaster
Cousin is crushed, you're lovin' the rush
Beast mode, animal house, straight off the intro
Sit back and watch a cool G rap, this is a demo
Menace with the methods, no sweeteners diabetic
Phys Ed raps, stretchin' 'em out, like calisthenics
Set it
Get wounded in the war like "MEDIC!"
No anesthetic, thus no medals for your effort
Fuckin' with this lyrical X pill, the vet's still a threat
He'll never defect, still I'm Destiny's Child
They Calling My Name
Come through, raw with the flame
Whoever want it get more of the same
Hold 'em scoreless, call it a game
All day, Sir I, get fly like I'm boarding a plane
Hard lines like the rhymes carved in stone
As far as the throne, see me anywhere
I'm not far from home

[Hook: Esoteric]
No matter how far we roam
We never that-that-that-th-that
Far from home
And we be right ba-ba-ba-ba-back
Guard your zone
We legendary like Guru and Preme
Don't you see what I mean?
No matter how far we roam
We never that-that-that-th-that
Far from home
And we be right ba-ba-ba-ba-back
Guard your zone
We legendary like Marley and Kane
Don't you see what I'm sayin'?

[Verse Two: Esoteric]:
It's time to rumble with rebels
We rough and tumble and ready
We come up humble and steady
But flows are Money like Eddie
We blow your brains to spaghetti
Your lyric book to confetti
I'm fresher
You flow like the male version of Ke$ha
You're watchin' history happen like Jackie Robinson battin'
Or archeologists mappin' a path to fossils
Imagine Apache choppers attackin'
You rappers softer than satin
The beat is knockin', it's crackin'
Yo, this is Boston and Staten
While y'all be talkin' like a felon
Like you hoppin' out of cell and
While y'all be straight pussy like the opposite of Ellen
I'm Macaveli rebellin'
I'm Martinelli, I'm clearer
I'm Fonzarelli in leather
You Nas in Belly, an actor
You unintelligent rapper
You barely relevant factor
The hell that I'm propelling at ya
You can't develop or capture
Your skeleton will get fractured
I'll break every single bone
Esoteric's international but never far from home

[Hook]{*evil laughter*}

[La the Darkman]
Yeah, INS, yo
La the Darkman
Hit 'em with the death blow
Yo

Yo, I'm known to spit poems, throw dice and hold tones
Show ice, puff bones, hit beats like Larry Holmes
Through the Valley of Kings, you catch the Killa Bee sting
Tryin to pick up, you fuckin with the archbishop
Defyin me is like startin Rap World War 3
You rather sell your key to NYPD
My style's vicious, I rap in the lab and break dishes
My words wear jet black hoods, lookin suspicious
Darkman

[Beretta 9]
Behold the struggle fire ultra harmonizer, track paralyzer
Artist he the real, blood spilled on the synthesizer
4th, turn it up a peak, make the speaker tweet
Iron Sheik camel clutch a beat, rappers take your seat
In fact punch a clock, it's my time to rock, dock the known like a scott
Engineered this thought that I present, so just
Comprehend, while I fill you in, with a bar or ten
And clear the path for the god Sin, do 'em in kid (Yo)

[Killa Sin]
I stay lurkin, circlin the premises
Dart chemist sent on a search for arch nemesis
Concoctin neurotoxins out of synonyms
Send your physical in triple shock, crippled in a detox with no rememberance
While I rocks the maximum shows for no minimum
Capacity to pack the front row but flow naturally
Killin 'em, swing on the stage like jagged pendulums
And blow like thirty shrapnel grenades with no pins in 'em

[Street Life]
Why risk it? Killah Hill District, we flip shit
Egotistic, I hold grounds with twin biscuits
Put it up, I lay it down, my streets sound surround
Shaolin bound, flash flood watch you might drown
Headliner, move through the city like a sidewinder
Island drifter, black vagina finder
Loungin by the seashore, switch like Bloody Roar
And slap hardcore dick to your main wiz, bitch

[Inspectah Deck]
Toxi' on Bacardi Pina, low crawlin through Medina
Slumped in the seven-seater
Dumpin heaters, to bite might cause seizures
Weak MC's take me to your leader
We the true source, movin off on uncharted course
My thoughts come across with a blindin force
Killa Bees plant seeds, log on
Or get knocked off like a pawn if you dare lock horns

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
You are now in the 9th chamber
Where the falls of reality close in fast on the world of make-believe
And your fantasy is nothin more but a memory
Now bear witness to the realness
Shown and proven
We live by the sword...[Intro]
"It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space."
"The mysteries of creation are there."
"Up in the sky?" "Up in the sky."
"The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked."
"Prepared for lift off."

[Verse 1: Guru]
I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters, shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave, causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the father, and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another Cee Cipher pulling my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers, little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten percenters, promoting slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp veins heavenly praise and dues are paid

[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds raining down
Holding it down

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the Gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus, regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust
Who but us, to supply ya with the fire
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo cause the battle's still on
Sound the horn, we come rumbling through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch something
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humungous effect in the world we could have conquered it

[Hook x2]

 [Hook]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long, any time she goes away

[Verse 1]
It started out east New York, where I grew up
Knew how to walk, favorite carry weapon was a 4
Older folks, smoked out stragglers, [?]
[?] bust three at yah
Dad fucked up consecutively
Him and some relatives were gangstas, sellin' pussy
Mom [?] on the spot, smacked me in the knot
Only thing he gave me was a name and a Glock
That shit popped, still that's me still, keep it real
Wasn't for him and the steel, probably wouldn't be [?]
[?] out, toned out
Three days away from home, stoned out
Coach [?]
Son I'm sendin' you home, nigga you foul
[?] half the niggas I run with[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
It's not Jacob, but you can still call me the jeweler
You know how I throw that jewelry on you
And this one right here, this is just a tennis bracelet
You rock that with your white Nikes, and your white tee
Sunny Dave' style, ya'll feel me? Come on

[Inspectah Deck]
I dreamed I was top of the world, watching the world
Awoke to a room full of smoke, gun at my throat
I dwell in the heart of the hell, but never fell
Po'nine scopin' me the whole time, they close behind
My wants just as big as my needs, so it's agreed
To strap up, tie these shoes, provide the school
A wild out, had to hide out, in China's house
Then run free, down to 1G, and hungry
I won't fold, from the chokehold, I broke molds
Fake ones, fake as they come, waiting to front
I fight if it cost me my life, toss me the knife
To move up, I do what I must, but who to trust
I came from the grain and remain mentally stained
The hardships, starving artist, it's obvious
I'm 'raging against the machine' to make some CREAM
That's how we live, just grab your kids, now we big
All up in The Source, we flip and win the toss
The law say, lock 'em away, vow to this day
The world is ours, we the loud ones at early hours
Striving, for a new way, my dues are payed

[Hook 2X: Inspectah Deck]
All I want is mine..
All I want is mine..
All I want is mine..
All I want is mine..

[Interlude w/ Hook: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah.. I mean, yo, we grinding out here
We got our lives on the line
We got oddballs watching us
We got fucking thieves, crooks, murderers
Gangstas, we got all types of shit we gotta watch out for
Let alone, your right hand man'll send shots to wet you, son
Shit..

[Inspectah Deck]
My conscience beggin' me chills, steady we build
I ask, is it back to the cracks after the raps
Where I'm from, used to be fun, soon'll become
A deathtrap, mental setback, forget that
I'mma do this, for that all I am, call out a man
Black like Sidney Portier, boy, beware
The future's now, my superpowers could move the crowd
The road I follow, so far to go to see tomorrow
I'm close to the edge, my folks are mislead
Some, lose a step, lyric clueless, they choosin' death
That's the wrong vibe, the strong survive, known as they strive
Now watch me, top of the key, dropping a three
In my fate, the biography state, I would be great
For now, I milk the cow, build it from the ground
More or less, continue conquest hard as it gets
The promised land, ain't promised to a honest man
So, right or wrong, I'm fighting on this life long
Now let me live, set for my wiz and seven kids
I hit the block focus like Mr. Spock
And whether, rhymes or crimes, all I want is mines

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
All I want is mines, what they expect us to do?
They taking programs to a channel, man
You gotta pay to be locked up, you ain't getting no jobs
Niggas got three/four kids, four or five baby moms
No crib, living out they cars and shit
I got to get mines... then ain't no stopping
I'mma do what I gotta do, and I'mma rep for my set
My nigga Case rest in peace, my nigga, I'mma see you
The'll never take me alive, the'll never take me alive..[Dialogue from "The Usual Suspects"]
There's no coke
What
You heard me you dumb fuck, there's no coke
What the fuck do you mean there's no coke
I've been up and down this ship. I've been in every fucking room
There's gotta be coke
There is nothing
Nothing

*heavy panting*
Help PLEASE!
*panting continues*
Help me!
*gunshot*

[Hook: Masta Killa]
It's assassination day, I stalk

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I move through the third world, my third eye's the guiding light
Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I live's a twenty-five to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
Cream is short, Cee Cipher Power stalk, plus the fiend talk
Three Gs the cost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen goal but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisoning the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened
Trapped in deep water, gasping
I clash with the titans for my half on the action

[Verse 2: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was the ears
Scorpion darts hits the mark, pierce the heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still feel this so you're living build tilted
MCs upon their axis, their body hazard tactic
Lactic acid, desert dry cactus, practice
You can never match this invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
Unforgivable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects more livable
Interchangeable, caution: flammable
My chamber is 99 plus 1  unnameable angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
We creep through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don
Spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurging, merging in the suburbs
Using this just like an adverb, action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aiming like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pa
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Holding like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high, yo Bobby
You hear how I'm shooting it like they blue tops
No, you won't play me like your lady
Pay me 380, spit it at you like a baby, final destination Haiti

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
War's extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take things to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MCs to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue death than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murderous rhyming, constantly inclining
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

[Hook][Verse 1: Large Professor]
Astonishing how I flip a mic and start bombin’ shit
Varnishing, paint on the wall with knowledge and
Wisdom, one, two, dip ‘em in the holy water
Rip it in the holy war, check ‘em into post mortem
Document, fresh direct Ralph Lauren hoodie
When I be on the West Coast rock with [?]
The limelight fry ‘em like five-fifty Fahrenheit
Fire mics daily with ninety-nine terabytes
Bangers, I pop up with new angles
In the maze, navigating this game, so far made loose-
And dead-ends, crystal mint, James Brown, there it is
Walking it, talking it, making it all connect
Through instinct, full of god, Iron Mike in the straight
Mosey up and away, grab your rosary
Hoes be all up in the mix tryna cake off
Or be left with crumbs in the end while I take all

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I’m straight boss, wave of my hand I make ‘em break North
I’m paid off, something like Bernie how I made off
Yours truly, got ‘em jumping like the horror movie
Shit your groupies move to couldn’t hardly move me
I’m that Beat Street Ramo with fuego
Pounds or pesos, don’t matter it’s all bueno
Pay close attention, mention my name: provoke tension
Bets in the game, there’s no question
This is Marco, Rebel on the job with the Large Pro
Lords of the Underground marked with the barcode
The Dark Knight, eyes on the city
Dimes on the sticky, overtime on my grissy
Mind on the moola, doola
Stepping with the superfly cougar and the personal Ruger
I’m through your brain like Hennessy black
Flow dawg, I’m a menace to rap, but stretching your crack

[Samples]
"Create astonishing lines"
"The flow is something amazing"

[Verse 3: O.C.]
Similar to Eastwood, roll in the gauntlet
Bulletproof bust but shots get to sparkin’
Create an idea, if there’s a problem I solve it
Maximize brain cells, glitter like garland
You can’t out-rap us, twenty-plus years been at this
Large Pro, I-N-S above average
This ain’t fire, this is arson
Big guns pointing at your toes, got rappers doing the Charleston
Breaking atoms send a spindle round your dome
When I hit ‘em, if I need help to Deck I shine a Wu emblem
M-Polo on the boss for dolo, whippin’ it like a Volvo
Picture this like a group photo
It’s a team effort, no need to fly solo
Bear witness, crown over mine, this would be the logo O.C
By design it was in the terrace
Simple A-U combined make it eighteen karat

[Verse 4: Tragedy Khadafi]
Gold bars, Libyan money, bloody the nozz
We the verbal gods, blow heat, discreet just to beat the odds
Exotic lodges, ménages, Khadaf is
Single-handedly murdering soloists and squadrons
This is vernacular, my poetry is spectacular
Bram Stoker choke the vocals of an amateur
Attack like terrorist plot from Afghanistan
African, we a pack of wolves, y’all a rack of lambs
Seven-and-one-half ounces of grand thoughts spilled
I’m like a shark with venom coming out of my gills
Behind enemy lines, ready for war still
Rhymes like extended clips spitting out of mack mills
Benevolent martyr, all my Gs scarred up
Mastered the art of these bars, word to the Father
Indigenous pharaoh, my thoughts travel
Like a hollow-tip through a barrel
Watch a universal battle
The magnum opus who’ll split an atom when he focused
We the titans in the cypher, y’all a bunch of roaches
Travel the Matrix in a time-portal spaceship
Visions of Euro stacks, better where my face is
Champion hoodie, shell-top with no laces
Queensbridge houses, nostalgic, most graces[GZA]
On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bulk
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave

[Hook: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fates erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

[Killah Priest]
Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, "I'm black and comely"
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail

[Hook]

[Outro: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, yeah, yo

[Inspectah Deck]
We pray for a better today, Glocks and berettas spray
Everyday, how did I survive yesterday?
I can't call it, cops shot the alcoholic
The fiend saw it, he got the gun, he want a dime for it
The hood life, chicks and thugs, crips and bloods
Dippin' on the judge, pushin' whips and drugs
Burnin' big buds, gettin' love, spinnin' them dubs
For the taste of it, the low lifes'll split your mug
It's the home of the brave, the zone of the slave
We all want it, but gettin' it's, a whole 'nother page
The young guns wantin' respect, flossin' the tech
Bitches wanna strip, now it's all for the check
Yo, everyday, lives at stake, pies to bake
Same knife that cuts your throat divides the cake
For the hustlers, thugs, who scheme to survive
And all in between, scream "Fuck a 9 to 5"

[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
In the bright lights, the big city
The thieves stay crawlin' at night, with eyes shifty
In the bright lights, the big city
The fiends come sortin' the price, with nine fifty
In the bright lights, the big city
They squeeze off, lustin' for shine and die quickly
In the bright lights, the big city
The streets take a whole of your mind, it gets gritty

[Inspectah Deck]
Daydreams, bought and sold
The high price we livin' might cost your soul
Secret indictments, furrows, with roll hoes
Codefendant, I hope he don't tell what he knows
Exposed to a life of crime since I was nine
Gettin' money by design, despite the time
Hustlin' to be a man and feed my fam
My wife, my seed, my land, completes the plan
Please understand, either legal or scam
I see the thieves in the van, I can't beat the man
Still monster ballin', eatin', speakin' ebonics
Wit foreign cars, custom made clothes and chronic
Bank rolls and prophets, shine solar powered
Fine hoes that's bout it, long as you keep they nose powdered
Obey street laws, careful what you say
You can play, but you might not make it through the day

[Hook]

[Inspectah Deck]
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I'm used to gettin' over
I'm deep in the middle, indeed the heat sizzle
For the littlest beef, even the seeds keep pistols
Foreigners talk funny, friends they want from me
But all I need is long money and a strong honey
I need it "fast", I'm "furious" like Vin Diesel
I'm lookin' at my plate wit food for ten people
So, do what you gotta do, do what you want to
The blocks hot like a sauna, cops try to pawn you
The fiends trick you, dude behind you wanna get you
On the grind, your best friend'll talk for a figure
Walk wit a nigga, see it, don't talk about it, be it
Don't walk around, then beat it, we all bound to feel it
This ain't the town (for real), so watch your tour (that's right)
What's goin' down (what's up), its poppin' off

[Hook]

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Gritty...[Kung fu sample]
*sounds of fighting*
Stupid fool, you're forcing me to kill you!

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, you know how it go
Fresh from the stationary hall of justice
Real rhyming, real movement, real life
Word up, we just chilling, ten bottles of Krug on the wall
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, for real
Yo, RZA, talk to these niggas, man, let's go, man, for real
Yo, Rah, what up? Let's go, yeah, gangsta shit, groovy shit
Raw shit, secret indictment shit, yeah
Secret indictments, be careful, niggas
For real, let's go

[Hook: RZA & Tash Mahogany]
You better get that money, no matter, what you do
You gotta get that money, and represent your crew
And keep it true

[Raekwon]
As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamoned up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know if you saw me, you thought I was broke
Black, yo, I been hustling since niggas was busting guns
And scuffling, and jumping niggas over some coats
We play the S&S rooftop, Latin Quarter, Polo popes
Who hung out with all the Eighthers and GOAT's

[Hook]

[Interlude: Inspectah Deck]
Yo RZA, you crazy man
This that Black Mozart shit, right here

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I used to scramble hard, radio strapped, to the handlebars
Fifty deep, in the lobby large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fifth of Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by O.G.'s, holding O's and up
Daily new drama unfold, they popped 'em over, what?
It's so rough, nobody know him, so what?
Aiyo, the money's close by, homey, show me the stuff
Borough hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like friday night cruise in the Coupe, new valor suit
Fruit flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40 Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loot
How they hit Miss Fisher, they was busting at suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passion fruit, Alize, in back of the Ooh

[RZA]
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
Bighead, I thought I told ya
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers

[Hook][Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo it's war on the street, blood on the cobblestone
I leave 'em buried alive, just like a fossil bone
Body bags line the streets, reporters reportin'
Mafia ties, drugs and extortion
DeLucas vs. Stark-iano, headline the news
Police pull war on crime, they're gonna lose
Judges get kidnapped, captains get decapitated
Starks rise above all to be emancipated
Black Godfather, families at war
Drive bys and Molotovs settle the score
Butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties
I made sure to keep guns in all my faculties
The streets run red when the bosses disrespect us
Neglected, I guarantee no man's protected
To each his own, grab a gun off the shelf
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self

[Hook]
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self
Cause in a warzone, the call is every man for self

[Verse 2: U-God]
How you prepare for war? Grab your guns and your hardware
Never close your eyes in the barber chair
The heart of a lion, that's what got him here
Bulletproof the car, yo, we outta here
Fuck the DeLucas, we've got shooters with submachines
Bone-crushing niggas like a football team, under a new regime
The old we throw it out, spin back the hammer, let the lord sort 'em out
Keep your gun cocked, at the whorehouse, sip the brown liquor
While we move a quarter ounce, pick the territories
Move north or south, the high power shine, yours is watered down
I'm underground, with the vest is on, open up your head
Now your flesh is torn, never turn my back up at restaurants
Put holes in your chest, come test the don
45 in my holster, let me stretch my arms

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
So the DeLucas want Tone? Nah, not today
Cock and spray, side with 'em and you've got to pay
Don't even kill 'em, just make 'em feel a lot of pain
Stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game
Greet 'em with open arms, beat 'em with no regard
Feed 'em two two-threes, freeze 'em, leave 'em with no resolve
Make a lead on me, repping for the territory
No stepping on me, brethren that's a negatory
You want a war? These men pop dangerous
Taking all in a 10 block radius
Murder rate double, triple, cripple the strip
Like it got hit with a couple of missiles
8 will fly through your door, I'll get in your crib
In a wig, in a cable guy uniform
My shooters maneuver, we've got DeLuca in the scope
Moving close, say the word, Tone, dude is ghost[GZA]
Pump and get sumped, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring, get done
Flashback, eighty-eight, rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
Two-hundred hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quit the rush every
Criminal mental, satanic penpal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, hiphop quotable
See many went, only one got us over do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield
Yo

[Chorus 2x: GZA]
Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get off blind

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we eat folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash thru like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear, then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme

[Masta Killa]
Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hiphop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape

[Chorus][Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Verse 1 - Inspectah Deck]
Pretty Tone, I got you, fingers
Morphine flow, lean on the brass gold
I can see your snake eyes without the crap roll
Bust the mack stroll, laughing at you assholes
Sticking thorns in my pride like the Black Crowes
Cracking your dome for breakfast, Deck spit
Lava, fresh like the produce section
Repping, there's no use testing, you know who stepped in
It's Deck bitch, for those who question
Like Serena on the serve, I swing hard
Main event, bad broads with ring card
This shit here, niggas get the fiend nod
On the wreck, though, these cowards never seen yard
Head boss, you scavenge off what Deck toss
I don't fall for petty talk I check the source
Flex force with army arms, I lets off
Bomb threat, blow both your stanky legs off

[Hook]
[ID]And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah
[SL]Or, try and learned it from the mental shit, son
[ID]And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah
[Method Man]Blaow, bang, cuz
[GK]Cuz I write, and blast and slash your whole level
[SL]Or, try and learned it from the mental shit, son
[ID]And make you bust shots in the air and scream yeah
[GK]Yeah, kid

[Verse 2 - Sheek Louch]
Pay attention, gun shots, fuck what you benching
Big chains on my neck, my wrist is Clinton
Presidential Rolex, coming out the projects
Seat back looking mean in a foreign object
Three for twenty in Japan, with American money
Get back home, get head from American bunnies
My Iron Fists, my platinum wrists
My cook up game is chemists, fuck my nemesis
Fly birds like Tyson do, had to switch
From the car to the cargo on board Jet Blue
Bodies drop from the Liquid Swords, been making hits for years
But I'm mad I ain't got no awards
I'm a real OG tho', swag like James Bond and 'em
My white tee is my tuxedo
Belts on the track, Sheek and Ghostface
Got the hood on smash, RZA leave it like that

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ghostface Killah]
We be jammin', I grill on the track just like salmon
I don't play no games, baccarat or backgammon
I'm Supreme Cliente', rawer than sushi
And if your girl got my number, means I beat that pussy
Sword slayer, dick slinger, I got the stroll
Of an R&B singer, Wu-Tang ruckus bringer
36 different dialects, we call spot checks
My homeland security, is up in the projects
Shaolin, Stapleton, Bricks on Broad Street
That's where niggas get chopped up like raw meat
Fuck that, started off rocking a stocking
Over my face, now my face is what gets it popping
Donnie had the wave voice, beeing blowed through the mic
The definition of TRU TV, fuck SPIKE
I'm the realest Akeed that ever wet these blocks
Too black for BET, too wild for Cops[Kung-fu sample]
I want them to fight!
Sister... sister, get out of there!
If you kill them, we'll never know who's the best

[Hook: Estelle]
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision, and that movement is in silence, ah
What are the true keys to being a ninja?
Dressed in all black, perfect vision, and that movement is in silence
This is Shaolin (Shaolin) this is Shaolin (Shaolin)
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin
This is Shaolin, this is Shaolin
This is Shaolin, Shaolin, Shaolin

[Raekwon]
He threw a kick at me, I back-slapped him, I pulled out the mac
He kicked it out of my hand, how real that?
Yo, a place where niggas get it on at
I think it evolved around three hundred raps, thirty stacks
He had black on, yup, I was dusted, with all of my bangles on
Two rings clustered, shorty black
He was there, this my nigga, check the bullshit, he jabbed China Man
He threw a sword right through his wool shit
Now he throwing stars at the kid, I'm jumping over my car, yo
Trying to get to my glove box and shit
Got the door open, gash in my caesar, my sneakers got red on it
Know that's blood, he threw a piece of a chain with a long blade on it
And a nigga was buckwild, I'm ducking and dodging
Trying to stick 'em with my little blade, Rae in some trouble
I got to the glove box, I threw two shots, he disappeared

[Hook]

[Inspectah Deck]
I stay there like it ain't nothing to face fear
Flowers by the grave of the niggas who say where
I'm straight tear, tell them don't play fair
Then retalliation, I'm a shake 'em just for scraping my suede pair
He told me "Yo, wait right here, son, I been there"
Rip your pockets off plus nut in your dame hair
Broad day, even with jake there, serious
Last time you saw me I was rocking the same stare
Do or die, you or I, cousin, I pray for you
Forgive me for my sins, father, this is what they made me do
Nonsense cause me to slay the fool, rather than play the fool
I resort to waving the gauge at you

[Hook]

[Raekwon]
The year of the bullshit, why me? The nigga had Asics on
A three hundred dollar pair, B
You don't scare me, wiping blood, hear me?
He laugh with a sinister grin, the sun went down, this is grim
Now I'm sweating, still repping my square, you probably under a chair
Black hood on and sporting a gray beard

[Inspectah Deck]
Respect mine, or there go your head line
A nigga got caught up, and left naked sporting a necktie
Skip town slide to west side, CSI riding on my hides
So I'm out til next time[Intro: Inspectah Deck (sample)]
(Everybody on the grind, son) 8 million stories in the naked city
(Everybody trying to eat) (It's always gonna be a struggle, in this hustle)
This is just one (Trying to bubble, trying to live this) Realize..

[Inspectah Deck]
We dance with the wolves, wrestle with the pitbulls
For fistfuls of dollars and cents, we empty pistols
Plotting out elaborate scams to get our hands on some
Lofts of land or maybe, thoughts of plans and they be
Forcing my hand to make me, off this man
I never claimed killer, I came iller stayed realer
Our chance grows, traveled the globe, fans applauded
But my heart still roaming the streets, they still calling
Boat names with cocaine dreams screaming "I own the game!"
I'm so stained Novacaine doesn't slow the pain
Lost so many I don't fear death, no tears left
Numbers of my years left, blessed to be here left
When they said "At fifteen he'll be already dead"
I'm here heavy head steady sipping Rmy Red
Wild fellow trying to keep my mind settled
Child of the ghetto, survived where nines echo

[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
I'm just a city guy living fly getting high
Live it till I die getting by, whipping by
Stand solidified big times to different sides
Here's your ticket right, follow if you feel my vibe... (My vibe)

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, we caped up, ten in the lab, weapons to blast
One with the city, fight for sections of land



Can't sleep till the check's in my hand
It's still a hustle, bare knuckle grind knee deep inside the struggle
I don't give a fuck about much but my beloved and such
Cause nobody to trust but us
It's New York life, walk like what you talk like
Or you mi[Intro]
I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in

[Hook: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

[Hook: Life]
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (x2)

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

[Hook][Intro: (Child) Killah Priest]
(One two, one two)
No doubt
(The microphone's on)
Cross my heart, hope to die
(I've been waiting along time for this)
Here we go, Killah Priest, '97, '98

[Killah Priest]
It's the Byzantine king, supreme
All kneel kiss the ring into a Elohim
I blow steam from the families of the Macabees
Smack emcees, watch 'em scream, "Your Majesty!"
Make them suffer the capacity of tragedy
Hold the crowd down like gravity
Back the fuck off, stop grabbing me, hands off me
Niggas start to bore me, I'm getting sleepy, I need some coffee
Me and my Wu-bandits
We bury niggas deep in the canvas, body bandage
Like some mummies, you fucking dummies
You can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited
The most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out, "Killah Priest!"
I leave the blood spilling in the streets
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville
The seven shields on windmills across the killing fields
Never forget it, tell them rap critics
I speak in arithmics
So they can never get it, I'm too scientific
Lyrics explicit, I roll with thirsty niggas, thieves and killers tigers, gorillas, faces like Godzilla
We stomp rappers and smile like a card dealer
We got iller, cross my heart and hope to die
We multiply, by the hundreds
Drunken by the thousand, see me outside your show browsing
Beating up your soundmen
Player haters and players, we give 'em cold stares
Any last prayers?

[Inspectah Deck]
Concrete techniques, bomb beats that cause casualties
My faculty, hold it down like gravity
Rapidly threaten like weapons to adolescents
Ghetto residents quick to past tense your present
State of the slums, kill for a plate of crumbs
Fake ones, they're coarse with smiles with snake tongues
I'm deep into this,I sometimes gasp for air
Deadly warfare, hot blocks, cops, and cold stares
Shots blare like fireworks on July the 4th
Weapons get tossed, fugitive sliding off
My forces combine, new world, 2009
Digital criminals, we make mills in cybercrime
It's all planned ahead 2 times, I see the signs through a great mind
The heaviest chains could not bind

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
We stare you eye to eye
We tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die.. hope to die..

[Genius/GZA]
High ranked officials in armed tanks with missiles
Blood drizzle, simple fact, you slept on the issue
That before you started jerkin off Joysticks and Sega
I was rocking off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
True fine tune it, ship enough units
MCs ask, "Who be those rhyme killers in masks?"
No doubt, difficult task to last in the square
Beware, infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious with no opponents and blast through components
With microphonics, watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti became approaching this
Our incapable love speech remains motionless

[Chorus 2X]

Hope to die..[Intro: sample]
Hehehe, you know I guessed it
You would be the only one
Who would dare to come here, you got courage
Huh, hmm, before you get a chance to fight with me
You must observe our rules, and meet these two swordsmen first

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Whatchu know about steppin' out the crib like it's 20 thousand
And all fives, dust still in the fridge
Either or, yo, I rock like a meteor
Bitches know when the kid's high cause I fuck with the TV on
Winter time blowing, had the suede boxers
Petite fillers for the whole team, eight watches
Ladies and gents, watch me, every line is snake venom
Creepin' up on your brain like Excedrin
Blowing out veterans with a speech impediment
So underground I stay beneath the crevices
Bitter wars over coke stores
Arabian jewelers keep hitting me off for the cross
Shiek's wealthy princes and ayatollah
All I gotta do is kick a verse, they like hold this
You my nigga, dun, word to the light on the phoenix sun
Want you to take my daughter, give your queen a son

[Interlude: sample]
Halt, you leap me? That's right, I have heard you're the master of dragon's sword Right, hahaha, maybe, but try me

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
NY fitted, Jordan 13's on the feet
Splash blood on my threads, how I murder the beat
Like medicine to infants, out of they reach
In a charcoal seven with the chardonnay seats
Now my name ring, I played the born, and bare the storm
Now I made king, I weigh my arm, and they respond
Stay gone off that haze and Don, game long like
Triple overtime, overtime stay strong
The great one, fake none, put it on the Bible
See me face to face, look me in my eyes, deuce
Spartacus flow, soul cookies in the vinyls
Only time I go soft, raw pussy on the cycle
Your highness, INS, darts catch your body
And all a nigga saw was the sparks from the tommy
Papis split the fishscale raw, copping polly
Big brother Rollie on Deck, got it roxy

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
My rap is like a holy drug cart, documented in my sentence
Around the edges, sold my presence of my life beginning
For born bloody swarm, early to a Godly finish
To naysayers throwing stones, hoping I'll diminish
The skies open, til I rose from three or four dimensions
With great rings, less then the dollars the grave bring
Meet the afterlife, chapters I write, with great king
A spiritual [?], hearing from beyond
They talk to me through a cloth coofie, Lord's beauty
And I'll admit through gems of life, I lost jewelry
Amongst the land dwellers, never trust what a man will tell ya
They give you stone for bread, you found dead
With no dog to smell ya, passing acid in your liquor glasses
When they pour it, have you throwing up blood and courage
Just a week ago, you spotted them walk in
With your enemy, and you recall it
They wasn't mean mugging, they were talking, plotting on you
But God made me unnormal, your diary rise
Breathing the immortal

[Outro: sample]
It was mean, while I'm fixing
His identity, overthrown by the republicans
But our people are still suffering, I am determined
To reorganize this justice, to help our people
By overthrowing the republicans
So help me to regain our position
We will overcome the republicans[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Ghostface Killah]
Sitting in this library, man
Reading these fucking books
Britannica Encyclopedias, L. Ron Hubbard, Tony Robertson
These muthafuckas, you know what I'm saying?
Sheek Louch

Glasshouse
I reside by the library
Yves Saint Laurent frames
Sipping Ciroc berry
Burning the big dutch, sweet feet up
Long ashes hanging off the blunt, then I pluck
Fell back power napping
Stones they cover my bones
Bricks laying on my pinkie like tombstones
Unbutton my shirt, unloosen my tie
Got the fireplace up real high
Cuban maid sliding me cookies, tall glass of lemonade
Chandeliers hanging over my head
Sitting like a cloud of haze
Larry King on mute
They about to bury Wesley for taxes
Then shot across the two
Then I grabbed the remote, hit the volume on the big lion
The screens in his mouth, a ninety inch giant
Went to commercial, the phone rang
“Yo, what up Sheek?”
“Ain’t nothing, Tone, just on my dean”
“Out here in Queens, I bag me a queen”
“Fed her all this shit she wanted to hear, she probably want the ring”
True!

[Sheek Louch]
Yeah, different time zones, that’s all
I mean, I’m over here across seas
You over there in the States
You over there, but either way we gotta get this money, fam
Yo yeah

On the tenth floor, looking over Paris
My neighbors all embarrassed
Cuz I’m ass naked, watching the clock
He hating, but his wife steady watching my cock
Different time zones, steering wheel on the right
Driving down the wrong street thinking what the fuck I’m gon’ eat tonight?
White women laying in my bed
I can make a documentary on what race can give the best head
Rae hit me on the text
Told me that he like that new shit, last night, that he heard on Flex
Alright cool, hit me up when you get down to Brazil
If the weather’s right, fuck it, I come down to chill
I got a briefcase of Euros and Indian money
Every time I’m in customs, they look at me funny
Yeah

[Inspectah Deck]
I’m out in South Beach, 1st street, Ocean Ave
AMG6 with the oak dash
Live the VIP life, I ain’t spend a clam
I got weight on the spot, that’s "instagrams"
Pretty boos in Jimmy Choo's with titties loose
In the mood, getting nude in the swimming pool
I’m doing my thing, how I’m repping, they salute king
And they don’t even know I’m Wu-Tang
Name heavy, phone call to my ace Diego
For anything, what up, man? Connect me
I snatch bank like four, five, six
Deuce high, watch a dude ride, I’m on my shit
Up in Mansion, salute, world famous Inspectah
Click large, homey, put some more tables together
Wild for the night, I ain’t even think about my flight
I got some bitches and they tripping off that powder white
Aiyo yo yo, kiss each other, yo[Intro]
Ohh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style, I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Master Killa]
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stinging while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seeking for a serum, to cure em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, K's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished
