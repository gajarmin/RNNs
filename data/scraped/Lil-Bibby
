[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
These rappers is actors, they life is in scenes (Cut, cut, cut)
You catch me in traffic, got pipes with the beams
Got so many clips that I could make a movie
Herb got the Uzi up under the Coogi
Them niggas with you they look like some goofys
Gon try to rob me, you gon have to shoot me

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Nigga tryna rob me? That will never happen
Keep my Smith & Wesson
Hollows to his chest some one call a reverend
Taught that boy a lesson, here come 911
Step right over here check him if you ain't check him
Four nickles jam, damn he caught a blessing
Better not come through flexing all my niggas reckless
If you looking for us, just pull up on Essex

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
I trap on the corner no matter the weather
A stack for the sweater, I trap in Margielas
Shooters they with me they pack a Baretta
She let me fuck from the back when I met her
That .357 will send you to heaven
These niggas is tellin my niggas is felons
My bitches dyking like they name was Ellen
Laughing at niggas like they name was Kevin

[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Aye, codeine what I'm sipping,  gas what I'm inhaling
Posto what you smelling
Rollin up dutches in the living room got my momma yelling
Chill out, why you trippin, fuckin up my session?
Here a couple 100's go watch channel 7
Momma knew I was the man since I was 7
Therefore she don't give a damn about the present

[Verse 5: Lil Bibby]
I hop on the track, you could see what I'm spitting
You niggas wouldn't believe how I'm living
I don't think they could take the heat in the kitchen
I pray my young niggas get freed out the prison
My block is hot, the police is tripping
My niggas savage, don't need a religion
I see niggas oppin then I'm going shopping
I pop out the cut then I'm squeezing and dipping

[Verse 6: Lil Herb]
Hah, and we call that completing the mission
You know everywhere we go got like 2 or 3 poles
Shoot the bitches if you look suspicous

[Verse 7: Lil Bibby]
Play with me, you gon sleep with the fishes
No them killers don't shoot from a distance
And them niggas ain't leaving no witness
Eat up tracks man this beat was delicious

[Hook: Both]
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
Niggas is cappin, they say that they savage
But I ain't heard nothin bout you
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
They say that they trappin, they claim that they got it
But I ain't heard nothin bout you

[Verse 8: Lil Herb]
Before me and Bibby had verses and show money pilling
We were just young niggas wyling
Even though I be rapping about murders and violence
When the police come, I'm silent
Louie V on my shirt, Gabana my shades
Versace my belt, I be stylin
Your bitch says she in love with my "Hot Nigga" verse
Now she sucking my dick from freestyling

[Verse 9: Lil Bibby]
I'm still puttin on for my city
Fuck niggas rapping like Bibby
Still ride around with my glizzy
Pull up and do a nigga like Ricky
Said you can't get out of this game
End up murked like Caine
Y'all niggas be looking like stains
Yung Berg I'll take a nigga chain

[Hook][Produced by Chief Keef & Da Internz]

[Intro: King Louie & Chief Keef]
Gang in this bitch

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'm a gorilla in a fuckin' coupe, finna pull up to the zoo, nigga

No, nigga, pull up on your block, we gon' blow, nigga
Go, nigga, run, nigga, run from the po', nigga (police nigga)

Young Bibby, I be thumbin' through that check, bitch
Young Bibby, I be thumbin' through that check, bitch
Young Bibby, I be thumbin' through that check, bitch
Thumbin' through that check
Thumbin'-thumbin' through that check, bitch

Whack a nigga, scratch his ass off the checklist
Aye, and I'm straight from the go
Take a nigga out his clothes
We don't trick, aw bitch, is you slow?
Do me a favor, grab your shoes, close that door
Aye, cash what I blow
Cali' plug got that gas for the low
Your boyfriend smell like ass and he broke
Bufford needa' stand his ass by the sto'
Aye, sell some weed, sell some coke
Them No Limits come through, get low
Aye, you better run, Forest go
Aye, got that 50 shot, drug get you slow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I bet I look like a stain, faneto
Bitch, I got 30 in my thang, plus 3 more
Walk up on me strange, watch me blow
This cash like heroin in my veins, I need mo'
I'm still a Heron, fuck the lake and fuck the fo'
And if you ain't no day one gang then you don't know
Jumpout Gang and Cuckoo gang go boom, boom, boom
Pull up, skurtt, everybody on the floor
Bitches call me G Herbo or Herbo baby
My whole city know that I go crazy
And No Limits strapped up like the Navy
Run up on a nigga and play crazy
90's baby but I got crack like the 80's
Thumb through them racks last summer, bitch, I blew like 80
I won't tell you no lie, on the lady that made me
So watch just watch how I do them this summer
Pull up on them corners like, bang, bang, bang

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Louie]
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Turn up, I just hit a stain, finna' go
30's and them thangs when we roll
We don't save these hoes, no hero
Send him to the E-, ah nosy ho
Bitch you know who King OVO
No Limit with the mover, Rollie Glo
My name is Louie, but they call me Tony
We met last night she sucked me to the morning
I love that Ralph, I smoke it by the Lauren
My smile Benz, I be talkin' foreign
I be dumping Ps when I'm not recordin'
If a bitch don't like bitches then she borin'
Your bitch on my dick, I will be scorin'
Numbers on the boards, boy I pull up scorin'
Days and the days when we warin'
Back-to-back hits on the foreign
Your bitch need to fix my dickasorem
These niggas talkin' shit until you hurt 'em
My girl shoot shit up, she a squirter
Beat the pussy up, she love it when I hurt her
When I'm done, I'mma need a lawyer
Don't got change for nothing, all I got is C-Notes
Catch a opper lackin', bingo
Extended mag, might not have to reload
If we miss we spin back round and re-blow
Catch him in the club, K.O
They likin' bricks, knockin' niggas out, Deebo
All this damn money, [?]
Bitch I know you see me, vevo
Smoking opps, pack is shit, is lethal
You'll get shot at when we see you
All bag leave you see thru
I'm off a flat, rockin' like a beatle
I get dirty money like it ain't illegal
They kill in Chiraq like it's legal
Pop out shoot shit up like a needle
Try to take my chain, I ain't going
Shoot him in his brain, I ain't know it
Take a nigga chain then wear it
Pass it to the gang now we sharing
Turn a goofball to a spirit
Bullet turn a nigga to a bitch
Hit, screaming like a bitch
You a goofy got hit on the hip
I'm thumbing through a check, running up a bag
Since you can't get no money get a ?
You can't get no ride bitch call a cab
I be mixing drugs like a lab[Intro: Lil Herb & Lil Bibby]
Time to let these niggas know what it is in the streets
Aye Bibby, let's kill shit broski. Whatchu wanna do?
It's whatever man, just go on ahead and rip that shit
Ima come around and clean that shit up
Lets get it

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty I'm really wit' it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
Lil Bibby on the track with me
One mistake and he clap fifty
When I hit the scene hoes go insane
Cause they know a nigga got them racks wit' me
No velcro but the strap wit' me
Let a nigga wanna act silly
I'mma let it off and then leave him there
Ride off and don't even care
Bitch I cash out 'till I pass out
Got a couple trues I don't even wear
In the game bitch I do my thang
Hoes scream my name I ain't even there
Lil Herb boy I does this
Leave your bitch wetter than a pool pit
And I make bands like I make friends
Bought some ray-bans on some cool shit
But now it's back to some killa shit
Got some wild hoes that'll drill a bitch
Yea it's no limit, thirty years runnin'
Thirty years gunnin' and we still the shit
I never run cause I stay to fight
I'll cook a nigga like steak and rice
And it's hella real in the battlefield
Gangbang gotta pay the price
Hit a nigga with the forty fifth
Bet it make his ass do forty flips
M-O-B I don't love a ho
Imma be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die
Smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man
Cause I understand how a nigga lie
Never snitch on a nigga dry
Yeah that's how a nigga die
Got a yellow bitch in the passenger
She gon' suck and fuck if I get her high
If I do the dash then my whip will fly
Foreign shit what a nigga ride
I ain't never snoozin' let a nigga try
Got the nine ruger on a nigga side

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Lil Bibby, no limit yea I'm all about that sack bitch
My young niggas they clap shit
Let the mac spit, we whack shit
Weezy in that cut
With that nina that's that black bitch
Rico wanna' get 'em, I'm like cuz' man I got this
Shootin' shit, Hittin' shit
Four five extended clip,  y'all be on that snitchin' shit
And Y'all know what snitches get, No limit shit
We wit' the shits, I'm focused on gettin' rich
M-O-B forget a bitch, right after I hit the bitch
Like point me to the kitchen bitch, I be water whippin' shit
Whip it, Jeff Gordon whip it, hit it wit' the fork
Straight drop no shorts
Shooters on and off the court, shoot a nigga off his porch
Turn a nigga to a corpse, yeah, I'm bout that
Rollin' up that loud pack
Catch me lackin'? I doubt that, cause I never leave without that
And that's real shit, got real hitters they kill shit
You fuck around hit the kill switch, these hollow tips you feel this
And I'm tryna get real rich
Cause my mama said I wouldn't be shit
Nobody never gave me shit
Like "Bibby hop on this remix", that's five hundred, no free shit
Cause I'm hot and I do this shit for my block
I got thirty off in that Glock, have my nina give you top
Bodies gon' drop and we ain't gon' stop
R-I-P Roc
Catch a few ops, send a few shots, might hit a few blocks
Fuck a few thots, I need two mill might seem like a lot
But I spit straight drop so its really not
My team gon' eat, R-I-P to police
Fake niggas don't speak
Cop killers in the heat, catch me in the streets
Shout out to broski[Produced by C-Sick]

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
They say I'm from a place where niggas don't make it out
Best thing to do is get your cake and bounce
Word around town, bucks made it now
But I'mma go hard til they take me out
And I'm ridin' with the goons cause the goons gone shoot
Thick white Shawn  don't want a new coupe
If a nigga was a threat then that boy'll be through
Twenty on his head, what the fuck he gone do?
I ain't duckin' no action, I ain't just rappin'
Young niggas clap, we can make it happen
Learned mathematics, fuck with crack addicts
Was gone for a minute now a nigga back at it
I kill for the dough, still kick it though
Still got smoke and it still for the low
In the field with the shit, I'm still with the shit
Niggas know Bibby, I'm as real as it get

[Interlude]
Hold up
(Nigga what's up bro?)
Niggas round here talk crazy bout what they'll do to a motherfucker
(Like what?)
You think I don't worry about a nigga man?
We got more choppers, more lawyers, and our (?)

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm from a city where they forever hate
Young nigga wanna see better days
Lotta nights I coulda seen Heaven gates
God stay with me but I never pray
I keep my gun on me, I ain't never safe
And I'mma let it spray naw I won't hesitate
And Mills with the steel cause it's real in the field
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
And yea I got an open heart for my niggas
But still gotta keep a Glock for my niggas
Can't stop me once we squad up, with my niggas
Gettin' money, fuckin' stars is my niggas
They ain't tryna play the part of my niggas
Then I might have to depart from my niggas

[Interlude]
Look it's like what's best for everybody else ain't always whats best for you my man. Can't hand feed no sharks nigga. Still Never Leave My Brothers though

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + Lil Herb]
Young nigga so sick, need a check up
On the road, people tryna run they check up
Gettin' money, all these hoes wanna sex us
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
Lose your head before I leave it on the curb
This real talk, it's not just some words
Niggas sneak dissin'? Man that nigga got nerves
A call to the city, gotta check up on my nigga Herb like
What up bucks? What up bro?I'm ridin' on east with it on me
I still gotta look to my left and my right
Niggas want me to sleep by my lonely
I'm riding and smoking and thinking
I'm only 19 but feel like a grown-up
Look at the mess that we madeAll these other MCs tryna clone us
Ain't that a bitch
And my face on my dick
Big face on my wrist should be makin' 'em sick
Start hatin' and shit
Man I think they just wanna see a nigga trip
Then I had a thought right when I was about to flip
Gotta calm down, let me hear my nigga TIP like[Produced by 808 Mafia]

My youngins in the cut with the carbon
Hit his top, knock his brain out his noggin
They know I run the town while you joggin'
Pussies want to go to war, send some shots then
In the kitchen, whippin' with the wrist!
At 15, Credo taught me this shit
Told me bibby, you got to do it like this!
Shake the dope, seroquels in the mix

Flip on, they can't do me like I'm Bobby, Huh!

I'mma get low but I'mma keep five, never know might need mine
Just in case shit get real, have to let them off and have speed time
My bitch bad like Keisha, and every night I'll eat her
Her hair long, her ass fat, she ain't even got no visa
35 for a beat, give me like 8 bands for a feature
Every time that I step out, be fresh as fuck like Easter
I'm gone...[Produced By Luca Vialli]

[Intro]
I don't know what the fuck these pussy ass niggas talking 'bout
As soon as I got that muthafucking check, I went and bought me 20 guns
Nigga I don't bullshit....
I'm not worried bout a muthafucka, not worried bout a soul
If a nigga lookin' for me, he know how to find me
I'm riding... I'm riding around North 10th
I just want to make sure I go out like Tony
I want to go out like Tony Montana
Look...

[Verse 1]
They calling me Bibby Gambino
Trap out the corner like Nino (Trap out the corner)
These rappers be stealing the lingo (For forty I'll get you a kilo)
I heard that you work with the people
I don't want to meet you my verses are lethal
I'm riding with birds in the regal that eagle
You gon' need a hearse when I see you
Like Trae tha Truth bitch I'mma asshole
All you fuck niggas Donnie Brasco
I get mad tho, drop the cash flow
Let the Mac go, keep 'em masked tho
And most of these niggas is phony
They pussy I call 'em jabroni
My lil baby choppa is on me, I pray that I go out like I'm Tony
I pray that I end up like I'm Diddy
Young nigga got keys to the city
Riding around town with the fifty
Ready to die bitch I'm Biggie
'Bout to go cop me a Bentley, hollow tips all up in the semi
Ay who that is riding in that new Benz right there
It's that fuck nigga Bibby
That be the fuck niggas hatin'
Hate to see young niggas make it
Them games my niggas don't play it
Threaten my life Imma spray it
Going for the home run fuck a base hit
Where the cash at I'm young and impatient
Niggas hate I'mma stunt in they faces
Run the check up and throw it to they faces
And we use to stash some guns in the basement
Young nigga sell jugs out the vacant
Lil Chris in the cut, he gon' blaze 'em
Pussy nigga try to run we gon' chase him
Dope spot had the whole east baking
Free G Gill out the feds he face it
25 years cause the police racist
[?]
No limit ass nigga, and I'm grinding
Young nigga got the  city all behind me
All these rappin' ass niggas try'na sign me
In the hood with the killers where you'll find me
I am not a rapper, I am just a trapper
You are just an actor, you are not a factor
If a bitch try'na set me up I'mma wack her
Pop wasn't around, I'm a young fresh bastard (Aye)

[Outro]
Hurry up and kill me, fuck you nigga...
Na-na-nah, "Hurry Up And Kill Me" is an album
"Hurry Up And Kill Me" is an album
Aye...
Aye...
Aye, Aye[Intro: Lil Bibby]
I don't know what the fuck wrong with these niggas man
Somebody tell me, please tell me, I don't know
It just, I don't feel these niggas

[Hook: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Yea, I'm the young nigga with the sick flow
They watchin' how I move cause they know I get dough
Posted on the block, stuntin' with my kin folks
Nigga, you ain't talkin' money what the fuck you here for?
When I'm finna cop a crib somewhere by the rich folks
Same old young nigga used to kick doors
The whole world love me cause they know my shit cold
If not, I switch hoes every time I switch clothes
Pockets got knots in 'em, keep a couple Glocks near 'em
Long ass clip, know it got a lot of shots in 'em
Keep a bad thot with 'em, killas from the block with 'em
Pussy ass rap niggas always got the cops with 'em
That's why I can't fuck with 'em, never put my trust in 'em
How they gone react when a nigga get to bustin'?
Couple shots fired, watch the niggas get to runnin'
Niggas sneak dissin' so I just say fuck it

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Really said fuck 'em, this is not a rap song
Boost Mobile Curve, this is not a TracFone
Contract free, what a nigga trap on
Inner tube, cocaine with the mustard on a couple
Pray the Lord keep me safe from who I fuck without a rubber
Prayer make me cold hearted, I don't ever wanna love again
Sacrificing random money, up and bought another Benz
Brother got murdered, I'll never have another friend
Now I'm blowing loud when our lounge got emotional
At times but the drugs help a motherfucker tuck 'em in
Diamonds in my teeth will help me represent the struggle
People in position recognize a nigga muscle
When you come up in the slums having nothing make you humble
Stomach rumble learned to kill without a question in the jungle
Scary ass rappers when I leave a nigga mumble
Got it out the mud, they respect a nigga hustle

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
I be tellin' my little brother
"Mane look you got a whole promising future in front of you"
He be ready to flash out and you know, go with his move
I really don't feel right givin' no good advice cause I'm in the streets thugging
I can get killed or go to jail any day
Shit, but by any means, we gonna fucking eat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + (Kevin Gates)]
Aye Gates, where should I start with 'em?
I can tell these young boys ain't got no heart in 'em
Niggas funny, you don't even like to talk with 'em
(Me either but we gotta play it smart with 'em
Man fuck 'em in they ass, we finessin' for the check
If they get outta line they might get one in the neck)
Lay a nigga down, then skeet off in the 'Vette
Leave a nigga wet, I can't take no disrespect
(Loaded Mac-11, Bibby come through with the Tech
Shoulder play amazing nigga wanna get some wreck
Say you want us dead? You won't take another breathe
All I know is us, I don't see nobody else)
Did it on my own, I don't need nobody help
I was on the block movin' P's by myself
Chasin' after cash, everything movin' fast
Gotta get it while you can cause you know it won't last
(Rap don't work, Back to standin' in the trap
On the phone, in the kitchen, cookin' wearin' slabs
Nigga want four, I'mma hit him for the 40
40 Grand a bird, yea, a nigga been retawdid
Me and Bibby in the building, life of the party
Know it's got a name but I don't know what to call it)

[Hook][Verse:]
I been grindin' for weeks, ridin' with the heat
I'm a real nigga I ain't hide from the beef
Plus I gotta lot of tasks to the streets
Got some young niggas on the ave with the D
Everything for the low, sell mine for the cheap
You ain't gettin' money you ain't buyin' it from me
She givin' brain if she ridin' with me
She say she love me but she lyin' to me
But I just use her for the night then duck em'
M.O.B boy we don't cuff em', we don't love em'
These hoes bustin', we just fuck em'
We can't trust em'
And I'm married to the money need a wedding ring
I was broke not a kid need everything
I remember when a nigga had hoop dreams
Nigga playin' both sides like he got 2 teams
Pull off on the lot whip too clean
Way I'm ballin' you would swear I had a few rings
Every month I'm trying to pull up in a new thing
Everyday I'm on a hunt for some new grain
If I want it, I bought it, I'm ballin'
These hoes keep callin', they stalkin'
Look Bibby don't care what it cost him
These groupie hoes won't stay off himAce: You got money in your fucking pocket?

Calvin: I deal the block, it's my block

Ace: No, you can't do that, cause if you get fucking busted you fucking all of my shit up you understand that? And I ain't having that. You gotta have this the way I give it to you or you can step. You understand what I'm saying?

Rico: Fuck him, he don't get shit anyway. Who the fuck is this Kermit the frog face ass nigga right here B? Slap the shit out you B, who the fuck is this nigga?

Ace: Hold on one motherfucking second man, I said I got it over here, thank you

Calvin: You know what A? I see you out here, you doing ya thang with your man and that cool. He's a funny guy and all that. So, Imma step, aight? But I'll see you later

Rico: Fuck outta here

Ace: I keep telling you the same fucking thing about things man

Rico: You always telling me man, what the fuck is the use of having soldiers if you can't use em? That's why I'm Rico that's why I do what I do manBig Bucks stacking money to the ceiling
Ask me what I need, bitch I need me a million
I know that it's coming man I got this little feeling
Buy a couple buildings, open up a business
Donate a couple thousand to the children
Y'all some broke boys need to go out and fix it
You pull up on 6's, stunt for the bitches
I pull up in a foreign, all these hoes going

I'm the man and they know it
I ain't gotta show shit or hit the club and throw shit
All these fucking haters make it hard to stay focused
WhiteShawn got it, if I holler, he gon' blow it
No Limit all these niggas know we
Steady rolling blunts until a nigga O.D
Keep acting blind, in a year they're going to see
Nigga how I ain't the man, and your bitch want me
I don't get it, black card, No Limit
Niggas steady talking money but ain't trying to go get it

No gimmicks motherfucker, this the real me
Even a paralysed nigga gotta feel me
Got a couple dollars but a nigga still cheap
Opps sending shots, pussy niggas try to kill me
There's too many niggas hating
Jumping on my dick because they see I'm money making
Acting like they real but I know they really faking
See me out in public, wonder why I never say shit
Lil Bibby man I rep my turf
I swear to fucking god I'm the hottest on earth
Got a couple youngins that'll put you on a shirt
And I love my little niggas because they always shoot first

Headshots, slam jam, we don't play around
The opps hear that gun sound when we come around
Catch a pussy nigga lacking, then gun him down
I run to town, tell my plug to bring another pound
Cause I be getting shit off
Lil Bibby, I'm a motherfucking boss
Like Ross, Go in the store, and buy whatever, don't give a fuck what it costs

If I'm the underdog, get ready for an upset
Got these haters upset because me and broski up next
I just ball hard, trap money, fuck checks
Couple tracks kill, I'm the only suspect
I just plead guilty, because y'all be hearing me
Somebody call the doctor, tell him to put some fear in me
I'm so east side, I be where the killers be
Headshot damage you physically and mentally
I don't think they get that
They're stealing bars, I'm like "Can I have my shit back"
Where the licks at, hit it then I split that[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
These rappers is actors, they life is in scenes (Cut, cut, cut)
You catch me in traffic, got pipes with the beams
Got so many clips that I could make a movie
Herb got the Uzi up under the Coogi
Them niggas with you they look like some goofys
Gon try to rob me, you gon have to shoot me

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Nigga tryna rob me? That will never happen
Keep my Smith & Wesson
Hollows to his chest some one call a reverend
Taught that boy a lesson, here come 911
Step right over here check him if you ain't check him
Four nickles jam, damn he caught a blessing
Better not come through flexing all my niggas reckless
If you looking for us, just pull up on Essex

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
I trap on the corner no matter the weather
A stack for the sweater, I trap in Margielas
Shooters they with me they pack a Baretta
She let me fuck from the back when I met her
That .357 will send you to heaven
These niggas is tellin my niggas is felons
My bitches dyking like they name was Ellen
Laughing at niggas like they name was Kevin

[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Aye, codeine what I'm sipping,  gas what I'm inhaling
Posto what you smelling
Rollin up dutches in the living room got my momma yelling
Chill out, why you trippin, fuckin up my session?
Here a couple 100's go watch channel 7
Momma knew I was the man since I was 7
Therefore she don't give a damn about the present

[Verse 5: Lil Bibby]
I hop on the track, you could see what I'm spitting
You niggas wouldn't believe how I'm living
I don't think they could take the heat in the kitchen
I pray my young niggas get freed out the prison
My block is hot, the police is tripping
My niggas savage, don't need a religion
I see niggas oppin then I'm going shopping
I pop out the cut then I'm squeezing and dipping

[Verse 6: Lil Herb]
Hah, and we call that completing the mission
You know everywhere we go got like 2 or 3 poles
Shoot the bitches if you look suspicous

[Verse 7: Lil Bibby]
Play with me, you gon sleep with the fishes
No them killers don't shoot from a distance
And them niggas ain't leaving no witness
Eat up tracks man this beat was delicious

[Hook: Both]
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
Niggas is cappin, they say that they savage
But I ain't heard nothin bout you
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
They say that they trappin, they claim that they got it
But I ain't heard nothin bout you

[Verse 8: Lil Herb]
Before me and Bibby had verses and show money pilling
We were just young niggas wyling
Even though I be rapping about murders and violence
When the police come, I'm silent
Louie V on my shirt, Gabana my shades
Versace my belt, I be stylin
Your bitch says she in love with my "Hot Nigga" verse
Now she sucking my dick from freestyling

[Verse 9: Lil Bibby]
I'm still puttin on for my city
Fuck niggas rapping like Bibby
Still ride around with my glizzy
Pull up and do a nigga like Ricky
Said you can't get out of this game
End up murked like Caine
Y'all niggas be looking like stains
Yung Berg I'll take a nigga chain

[Hook][Intro]

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Goin' hard for my niggas that's all I got
Man whatever mine is yours that's all I got
And all I know is the hood that's all I got
That's on everything I love that's all I got
No I don't play about my mom she all I got
Yes I will kill you bout my brothers they all I got
No we don't talk to undercovers that's all I got
I'm either rappin' or i'm trappin' that's all I got

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Young nigga always on that gang bang shit
Bag it up, slang piff, different day same shit
This fame shit came quick, but I can't switch
They try to come and change shit but I remain this
Real nigga from the start to the finish
All my whips are tinted, and all my niggas winnin'
Yeah, you could tell the difference, i'm the realest in it
Don't make me call them killers get you gone in a minute
You know we keep that tool fam, please don't front your move fam
How you on that news cam, you shoulda stayed in school fam
That 30 gets you two grams now, they dreamin' bout a new Lam
And I, walk around with a few grand, everybody got 2 hands
She gon' fuck cause she know we them niggas
Send a bitch to the store for some swishers
So fresh I just pose for the pictures
My niggas know I won't fold on em, see the opps then roll on em
Judge offers you two years and you told on em?
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
No I won't never leave my brothers they all I got
Shit'll never be the same
Seen my 10 year nigga Kobe die right before my eyes
And I miss my bro so i'm rollin' up swishers
And i'm pourin' up a 4 right now
And you told me bro you gotta watch these niggas
They're tryna come around you now
These niggas ain't real, same niggas I was with in the field
Boy I treat em like family now
I don't got no deal I don't live in no house on the hill
Fuck nigga this all I got
And i'm still the same nigga got the gang with me
150 killers in the lane with me
In the same city Crazy James with me
Betta not run up on me he gon' bang semis
Slay the game my man bitch I play to win
I won't never change, all the change I spend
All I count is bands, tryna touch an M
When I touch an M, touch an M again
Niggas come around like some immigrants
Ain't no new niggas don't remember him
Who is you nigga you ain't cool nigga
You ain't shoot nigga, just a few niggas
Heard when you get money niggas change
I ran through a lot of that i'm still the same
And my niggas honor that
I know niggas when they left the hood
They ain't bring a dollar back
I trust my niggas they know where my mama at
We brothers nigga
And don't no money come above you nigga
I'll never tell ill do a hunned nigga
Cause I love you nigga

[Hook – Kid Ink]
You can tell em Imma do, what I want
I don’t care about your rules, just can’t lose
I said we ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it, no
We ain’t worried bout it, we ain’t worried bout it
All I need

[Verse 1 – Lil Bibby]
Said I ain’t worried bout a damn thing
Spent 20 grand on this damn chain
And if niggas thinking I’m a damn stain
Put a couple slugs in his damn brain
Cause we always strapped up
We ain’t got to call for back up
Don’t be fooled by this rap stuff
You can get your ass clapped up
Got two 30 clips, and a 50 in the trunk, we ain’t worried bout it
They said it’s in my car, on the scene last week
Three niggas got shot and I ain’t heard about it
Riding round with the pump, niggas still try to front
I done told niggas once, I ain’t taking no lose
Be smooth when you fucking with the bosses
Step up, it’s gon be a lot of coffins, baow baow

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Lil Bibby]
All I know is get money, nothing else
Niggas better keep their hands to they self
On my mama, if a nigga touch me
Then I promise he won’t touch nobody else
All I need is a coupe and a bad bitch
And a Louie duffel bag with some cash in it
And a stupid ass crib somewhere out in the hills
So whenever I get bored I can crash in it
There’s a lot of bad hoes in my iPhone
Off white on, new mics on
And it’s hot outside, got my ice on
So fresh that I can’t leave the pipe home
All this cash once a young nigga do it
Everything in my pocket, Imma throw it
If he got his own squad I ain’t going
I ain’t worried bout nothing, bet I do it

[Hook][Hook]
I keep my pistol on me only at night
Because the haters be tripping,that's right
I keep my pistol on me
I keep my pistol on me

[Lil Bibby]
Late night I'm servin' fiends
And I'm rocked up
In the field with the Glock tucked
Fuck the cops bruh
I ain't trynna' get shot up
My nina on the side of me
It's speedin' through in the ride with me
I'm from the town you know how it be
Got to keep that all times nigga
I ain't lying nigga
Or you gon' end up dying nigga
Shots fired nigga
It's a man down
Leave yo' body juss' layin' 'round
But I'm the one that's sprayin' 'round so it ain't me
Big thirty so it can't be
I keep that
Gotta have it yea I need that
Drop his ass then forget the shit
Herb like where the weed at?
Only kush no seed pack
Word around I got free crack
I'm lackin' don't believe that
Thirty shots on my waist
Give a fuck about no case
Coolin' where it ain't safe
I need a mill on my plate
In this trap shit
Cause I've been doin' this way before this rap shit
Pistol on me in traffic
Real life no actin'
Young niggas they clappin'
And I ain't trynna' get whacked bitch
So damn right I'm packin'
Yea it's on me


[Hook]

[Lil Herb]
I keep my shades on at night
And not the Rays holmes
Cause ion' kick it in a safe zone
If you run up on me you get blazed holmes
And I been learned that
You can't get caught without one
Especially from where I'm from
And if you get caught without that
Then you might just get your scalp cracked
Know a couple niggas that got left behind 'cuz when it's crunch time they was juss' behind
It was clutch time so I kept the nine
And you never know when it's reppin' time
Yea the last time I slipped
I fuck around and got hit
Bitch niggas fuck around with the wrong clique
Must be fuckin' 'round with that shit
Yea it don't feel great but it feel safe when I walk around with the steel eight
So don't play with me cause I will spray
You'll be walkin' 'round with a steel plate
And that's real rap
Try to play me like a fuck nigga and get peeled back
Ion' trust niggas keep 'em real back
In my two-seater with the steel Mac
Pull up on 'em let the steel clap on my own shit
Drop a nigga fire the block up and get locked up at my own risk
Rather catch me wit' it on me
And I do my dirt by my lonely
I'm a real nigga I got real killas'
If I hit 'em up then they'll deal wit' 'em
L's

[Hook][Hook: Lil Bibby]
Just a year ago I was stuck off in a slump
I was broke, I ain't have nothin
I came from the bottom that's why I stunt
That's why I stunt, that's why I stunt
Might go broke, ion give a fuck
Pop a pill, that turn a nigga up
Catch me in the club might throw a few bucks
See me in the streets, niggas know what's up
Still throwin my set, that's where I'm from
I ain't worried bout nun, rollin up the blunt
Shittin on niggas that's why I stunt, that's why I stunt
That's why I stunt,and my momma ain't gotta worry bout nun
Ain't got ask no bitch for no money, used to be hungry now I stunt

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
You might catch me in the club counting nothing but one hunneds
Juvenile with cash money, I'm the number 1 stunta
Foreign whips all summer, ridin tinted, gettin blunted
And they all different colors, so you never see me comin
And the reason I be stuntin, is cuz I'm used to havin nothing
Schooling housing by the public, now them thousands ain't a subject
I put money first, trapping all summer call it sunny work
Went from rags to riches pullin bitches with a bummy shirt
Now the city sayin I'm the man in the streets
Going hard for the squad, throwing bands in the streets
I might go broke, but you know just how that go
If I go broke then a nigga getting poked
Nigga don't go then a nigga gettin smoked
Watch I get ghost, like a nigga didn't blow
Make the police think a nigga didn't know, like a nigga didn't know
Fuck the po po, if I had Court then a nigga didn't go
Had to see a PO, then a nigga didn't show
750 cost ten like I'm in a 6 4
I ain't trippin on a ho I'm too busy gettin dough
Same nigga by the sto, posted up, me and bro
Just roll up the dope, thinking bout a year ago

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Winter time I super grind, summer time we stay awake
I'm up early, whipping up the pies like Aunt Shirley
Rollin the loud make the blunt pearly, catch me on the 8 ?
Fuck the jakes, you get stretched for the cake
Bitches know the deal we can't chase erday, we just sex we don't date
Skeet her chest and her face, I flex on them hoes
Fuck like twice then I next on them hoes
Only want a night worth of sex from them hoes
Don't wanna FaceTime or chat with them hoes
I'm sprinting to them stacks, imma hit you right back
Trap full of white made (?) look black
Pull up in that thang with the ceiling pushed back
Riding by myself, but if you pull up on the side you can look at this mac
Remember I used to look at them niggas way back
Remember I used to rock the huaraches with the strap
Remember I didn't know how to fill a kinda stack
But now I'm that nigga and all I do is count em back
Yeah, and that's why I stunt
I ain't worried bout nun I do what I want
I ain't gotta trick on bitches cuz they wanna fuck
I'm just chillin countin digits, and I'm smokin blunts, c money rollin up
And if we pull up on a nigga then he betta duck
Cuz we got hollows in the semi you gone need some luck
My shooters on it, they ain't stopping till they see him drop
Cuz when a nigga kill yo homie you don't give a fuck
In the field for my homies we gone send it up
I'm off a hitta for Roc
R.I.P. free my niggas off the Remy's and Jocs
Used to ridin hot cars, now my shit off the lot
Just to sit on the block

[Hook][Hook: Lil Bibby]
My bitch hatin' she like, "You think you tha shit now"
And I can spend 10 on my wrist now
I pull up in them cars wit tha tints now
Turnt up. They like, "Boy you need to sit down"
Nowww, Now
Young nigga takin' trips now
Nowww, Now
I ain't gotta worry bout shit now

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I'm the shit now, they on my dick now
I ain't gotta go out lookin' for a lick now
Haters pissed now, they got big frowns
Overload the trap, throw my niggas 10 pounds
Make it flip, show you how to stack them chips
I ain't used to havin' shit
Turned that, into this
And my brother want a whip
So I told him go an' get it
They say the limit is the sky
I tell my niggas its No Limit
Wait. They don't get it
Yeah I used to serve the midget
Stackin' money to the ceiling
Now my features is 4 digits
Catch Bibby in the kitchen
I just get it, then I whip it
Then I dish it to my youngins
Then they flip it
Let's get it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chase]
People actin' stranger since I got this paper
My chick bad, she is danger
And my chains a glacier
Politics stay talkin' shit
No scholarship, still stupid rich
We poppin' more champagne, they reppin' our campaign
My chicks into fashion, my car is a dragon
My wrist a ballerina, my diamonds dancin'
My squad ball, you just a towel boy
Lil Bibby strapped like a cowboy
Bad bitches only, standards
You niggas broke, fractured
Ohhh my team is major, and these niggas hate it
Money talks, money on me man that's a fashion statement
Hit the scene stylin', money stay pilin'
Niggas want features, it costs you a thousand
Smooth Operator, never asking favors
Kill the club scene, nigga you could meet ya maker

[Hook][Produced by C-Sick]

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
They say I'm from a place where niggas don't make it out
Best thing to do is get your cake and bounce
Word around town, bucks made it now
But I'mma go hard til they take me out
And I'm ridin' with the goons cause the goons gone shoot
Thick white Shawn  don't want a new coupe
If a nigga was a threat then that boy'll be through
Twenty on his head, what the fuck he gone do?
I ain't duckin' no action, I ain't just rappin'
Young niggas clap, we can make it happen
Learned mathematics, fuck with crack addicts
Was gone for a minute now a nigga back at it
I kill for the dough, still kick it though
Still got smoke and it still for the low
In the field with the shit, I'm still with the shit
Niggas know Bibby, I'm as real as it get

[Interlude]
Hold up
(Nigga what's up bro?)
Niggas round here talk crazy bout what they'll do to a motherfucker
(Like what?)
You think I don't worry about a nigga man?
We got more choppers, more lawyers, and our (?)

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm from a city where they forever hate
Young nigga wanna see better days
Lotta nights I coulda seen Heaven gates
God stay with me but I never pray
I keep my gun on me, I ain't never safe
And I'mma let it spray naw I won't hesitate
And Mills with the steel cause it's real in the field
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
And yea I got an open heart for my niggas
But still gotta keep a Glock for my niggas
Can't stop me once we squad up, with my niggas
Gettin' money, fuckin' stars is my niggas
They ain't tryna play the part of my niggas
Then I might have to depart from my niggas

[Interlude]
Look it's like what's best for everybody else ain't always whats best for you my man. Can't hand feed no sharks nigga. Still Never Leave My Brothers though

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + Lil Herb]
Young nigga so sick, need a check up
On the road, people tryna run they check up
Gettin' money, all these hoes wanna sex us
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
Lose your head before I leave it on the curb
This real talk, it's not just some words
Niggas sneak dissin'? Man that nigga got nerves
A call to the city, gotta check up on my nigga Herb like
What up bucks? What up bro?I'm ridin' on east with it on me
I still gotta look to my left and my right
Niggas want me to sleep by my lonely
I'm riding and smoking and thinking
I'm only 19 but feel like a grown-up
Look at the mess that we madeAll these other MCs tryna clone us
Ain't that a bitch
And my face on my dick
Big face on my wrist should be makin' 'em sick
Start hatin' and shit
Man I think they just wanna see a nigga trip
Then I had a thought right when I was about to flip
Gotta calm down, let me hear my nigga TIP like[Intro: DJ Scream]
DJ Scream heavy in the streets

And this time around, we got a Chiraq
ATL connection
Introducing to the motherfucking streets
Lil Bibby!
And I give to to you for this season it's Free Crack
Turn up lets go

[Verse]
Remember back when I ain't used to have a quarter?
I started posting on blocks like "Place ya order"
Now I'm riding in Coupes and I'm flipping Porches
All from spitting these bars to a couple courses
I been locked up, shot at and damn near died back when I was 16
Lil nigga, big dreams, get cream
Hustle for something to make my wrist bling
I promise you, you not fucking with this team
Understand that the top spot, nigga I demand that
I came from the streets I should throw a couple bands back
That's being generous
These niggas illterate and ignorant
They not even completing sentences
Yeah, I'm really listening
I spit the shit
You can picture it
I'm killing shit
They feeling it
Meaning everybody gon' remember this
That Free Crack I'm dealing it
Something like that Pac shit
This for all my fans that been waiting on me to drop this
Everybody gon relate to it, It's not just no block shit
I'm overflowing can't stop this
Lil bro I got this
This that ride around with that Glock shit
And middle fingers to them fuck niggas that told me I was not it
When the album drop, go cop it
Need a flu shot because I'm sick
Back then they didn't want me, but now they all on my dick
And I only rap to my shit
I'm so fly like a pilot
Now I'm getting off topic
But it's about time that I change flows
Pulling up in a Range Rove
Getting money's my main goal
Bibby I stay flexing and all ya'll rock the same clothes
On the same shit, fuck the same hoes
Yeah I'm so different
L drop the beat then I kill it
Kill everbody up in this bitch cause I can't leave no witness
Nah I can't leave no witness
Killing everbody up in this bitch cause I can't leave no witness[Hook – Lil Bibby][x2]

King, double Styrofoam for the lean
Puffing 15, 30 grand in my jeans
And when I’m seen on the scene, it’s obscene
And a vert so clean, half a million dollar chain
Ask a ho who run it they go yelling out our name
Hustle gang bang green bitch, all we know is bank rolls
Get dough when the bank close, and there ain't no

Fuck with us, wreak havoc, bring terror

Everybody just go on now

[Verse 1]
I pulled up flexin

Youngin got bread but a nigga still stressin
Did it by myself bitch i ain't had help shit
Word around town is the kid got selfish
I just might spend 30 grand on my wrist
Feelin like the mothafuckin man in this bitch
Niggas lazy as shit tried to teach em how to fish
But these niggas just want you to hand em some shit
When shit get crazy they leave you in the dark
When you on top they act like they played a part
They done left Bibby in the water with the sharks
Homie switched on me stuck a knife threw my heart (damn)
I swear to god that shit hurt the most
Made it threw the struggle I deserve a toast
Almost drowned but I learned to float
Now a nigga got fans from coast to coast

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna hide the pain
Tryna stay the same
These niggas tryna throw dirt on my name
Money on his brain
Get you murked for some change
With the money and the fame you see everything change
I know the game like a mothafuckin ref
This the blueprint I'ma teach you the steps
Everybody in it for they mothafuckin self
Youngin chasin money niggas mad cause I left
What you wish I was broke or somethin
Runnin round the hood sellin dope or somethin
Niggas wish i woulda lost hope or somethin
When i told them thought it was a joke or somethin
I pull up stuntin

Man I'm thinking bout going out like Boosie
Bibby on some slow shit
Gotta stay focused
Street shit
Beef shit
Gotta make it out it

[Hook][Hook][x2]
I say, can I have your attention?
Fuck that, when you hear me talk, you better listen
I’m on the money making mission
Snakes in the grass got a young nigga tripping

[Verse 1]
Usually I don’t give a fuck
But I been feeling like who the fuck can I trust
When a nigga broke he do whatever for the buck
And I’m getting money so I keep my nine tucked
I got niggas plotting on me, keep that Glock up on me
Hella guap up on me, no you not my homie
I could get you shot up homie, and they ain’t gon find out
Bring them 45s out, every time I ride out
Try to come in my house, leave you inside out
We got choppers with 50 clips, and we be killing shit
Murder the witnesses, anybody could get this shit man
Ain’t nobody innocent, if I start it I finish it

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
I try and talk to em but, I don’t think they hear me though
Watch for the snakes in the grass nigga, really though
Especially when a nigga on the verge of making plenty dough
Informants tryna get in and see what Bibby on
Then they try to plant seeds all in your head
Got a nigga going crazy, man I think I need some meds
These type of niggas be worse than the feds
Like I got an opportunity for us to get some bread
They smile in your face, lying to your face
You just got to read between the lines of what they say
Insult my intelligence, who they think they effing with?
Fuck around, catch you out and let this MAC 11 spit

[Hook][x2][Hook x2]
Real nigga, I won't change

My youngins keep them thangs

Change, change, fuck wit' me you might get changed
Change, change, fuck nigga betta use yo brain


[Verse 1]
Pull up wit' my shooters in the backseat
Black gloves, black skully and a black tee
All my young niggas strapped and they clap heat
Real talk we ain't for none of that rap beef
30 shots in my PRPs, aimin' straight at ya r-i-bs
Young niggas that's all I need
War time lot of RIPs
Louie shoes, Louie shirt that stuntin'
Robin jeans, wheat Timbs that's nothin'
Lil Bibby he the man, can't touch him
Lotta guns, lotta hoes they bussin'
Wit' the squad over east throwin' Es up
Got some killas in the Wic, throwin' 3s up
Tried to tell 'em, but they ain't believe us
Tell me slow down, but I just speed up
Real nigga what'chu know bout me
Got some young hittas they'll blow bout me
Hatin' ass niggas wanna doubt me
Meanwhile all these record labels wanna scout me
Swear to God, young nigga can't fake it
Real nigga gotta see one make it
All black everything, I'm racist
Gotta pocket fulla Bens, come take it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Walkin' round witta tec on me
I'll die for my respect homie
Outta town that work triple
My mama callin' just to check on me
Get right or get left nigga
These bills ain't gon' pay theyself nigga
I don't need yo help nigga
Move every damn thing myself nigga
I be in the field all my niggas street certified
Young niggas load straps, then murda guys
And I heard niggas snitchin' on the other side
Free bro they tryna give my nigga 35
Feel like shit goin' all wrong
When I was fucked up, who could I call on
My pride never let a nigga hit y'all phone
Niggas choosin' sides, I'm like that's what y'all on
Goddamn that's my nigga since grade school
And you sneak dissin' on me, bro that ain't cool
Why you actin' hard bruh, you know that ain't you
I'm like fuck it man I guess that's what the fame do
2 Bs bitch I'm the same dude
Street code, I follow the same rules

You ain't real, my squad you can't fool

[Hook][Hook]
Young nigga, chasin' millions
Took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison

[Verse 1]
I used to want a coupé and a thick bitch
Now all I see is dead presis, got a sixth sense
Every day I'm on the block I'm thinking, this' it
My nigga outta town showed me how to flip bricks
He said, "Fuck this rap shit, this how you get rich"
They watchin' for that dirty money, I can't spend shit
I gotta feed the fam, I came up with a plan
I need some extra hands to help me move all these grams, for real
They see a young nigga stuntin', now they want you killed
Gotta watch out for these youngins tryna pay they bills
I swear to god I liked it better back when I was broke
I'm paranoid, I gotta keep my eyes on all these folks
Never been a fool, ridin' with the tool
Early in the mornin', takin' nephew to school
They say I changed, I swear I'm the same dude
Everything the same, I just change how I move

[Hook]
Young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison
I'm just young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison

[Verse 2]
My big brother prolly be somewhere up in the feds
My lil brother prolly be somewhere in jail or dead
Thank god a nigga used his head
I was stuck off in the slump just trynna get ahead
I was just like you
But I - seen a way out then what I do?
I had to put my mind to it
Niggas kept hatin', but I had to grind through it
Bitch, I define music
I ain't quit when shit got hectic
I did it on my own, niggas gotta respect it
And this shit for my young niggas, in the hood with no father
The shit I seen in these streets encouraged me to go harder
And this shit is off the top, my phone died, I got no charger
Keep it real with your self, I promise you, you'll go farther, eh
And these niggas didn't believe me
But now the whole world need me

[Hook]
Young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison
I'm just young nigga, chasin' millions
I took advantage of the blessings I was givin', Lord
I thought that I'd be dead or in prison
They told me I'd be dead or in prison[Intro]
The morning dance is not a good way to start 2013
And the numbers are climbing
When it comes to gun violence in the city of Chicago
We’re learning so far this weekend
All the victims have been teenagers
We have learned about at least five different shootings since Friday afternoon
And at least 6 teens have been shot, two of them have died
In just 12 days into 2013
And there's now a total of 22 homicides

[Hook x2]
We be doing hits
When we get off the shits
We ride on your block and get to lettin off clips
We be doing hits
We be doing hits

[Verse 1]
Uh, my youngins with the shits, they be doing hits
When I get in the booth, I be making hits
Nina on my hip, the 40 in the dip, (yeah)
Nigga ride through, his car getting flipped
No this is not a myth, I know you know Lil Chris
I have 'em blow you down, now its hot up your strip
My lil bro he a trip, he don't care about shit
And he'll hit you up, while you riding with this bitch, (yuup)
Kill them if you get, (fuck it!)
We got guns to pick, (yeah)
I just bought a Glock 9 with the rubber grip
Keep that in the whip, dirty Sprite I sip (sip)
Roll up gettin lit, when they bored, they do hits!
We gonn park da whip, and (gone spot a pick?
Let the choppas whip, R.I.P, you will be missed
Say we gonn park the whip, and (we gone spot a pick?
Let the choppas whip, R.I.P, you will be missed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I work late nights so it's no sleep
And these broke niggas be so cheap
And every nigga that know me
Know, I will never ever go sleep!
Sellin dope ducking police
Young nigga riding foreign now
Cause niggas pay to hear me and bro speak
These niggas is so weak, and I’m so hot, they so not!
Niggas talking that gangsta shit
But I don't never see you on your block
Find out where you hiding at and
Go Masked up and run up in yo spot
Got K rounds, put ya face down
Where the cash at?
I shouldn’t even have to ask that!
Make a move
Imma blast that
Dropping bodies like Mad Max
Red bone and her ass fat
Imma smash that, then pass that
Like Chris Paul on the side line til I get called
Niggas ain’t on shit y'all, they just talk a lot, but don’t shoot shit
Same nigga that got shot, and ain't do shit!
Feeling good buy a new whip
Some new kicks, a few fits to come splurging
Knew I'm back when I was serving
Now I'm foreign car swerving
Lil Bibby go too hard and these rap niggas get nervous!
I got shooters at my service...[Intro]
Fake niggas, Fake niggas I'm tired of fake niggas, aye, huh

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
It's way too many fake niggas, I'm tired of fake niggas
Sneak dissin' but be all in my face nigga
All these snake niggas how much can I take nigga
Money replace niggas, I stay far away from niggas
Too many hatin' niggas, I'm tired of hatin' niggas
Niggas act like bitches, might as well go chill with my bitches (yea)
Seems like fake niggas just around me
Do me a favor if you fake, stay from 'round me

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Fake niggas, lemme' tell you somethin' bout' fake niggas
Got 150 niggas ridin' with me
But I only fuck with bout 8 niggas
No really tho', circle small, cheerio
Hatin' on Lil Bibby flow, when I take off where did he go
Im gone, Cup full of that Kickstand just put me in my zone
Ain't doin' shit just coolin it, these niggas hittin' my phone
Grippin on chrome, haters get gone better watch yo tone
Takin' kush to the dome
Red beam on the gun you'on wanna get domed
Body might talk you'on wanna get drawn
Haters get blown put a body on the 9
Leave yo' face on a lot of shirts
Leave em' dead with a clothing line
Leave his ass right on the 9, Lil Bibby I'm supposed to sound
My bitches be over fine, what you need? I'm on the grind
In my face its all smiles
Talkin' down when I'm not around
I ring , bout' a pound
They only come around when im blowin' loud
In my face its all smiles
Talkin' down when I'm not around
I ring , bout' a pound
They only come around when I'm smokin' loud

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Capo (GBE)]
Fake niggas can't fuck with them, Hatin' niggas stay away from me
GBE and NLMB, them the niggas who fuck with me
It's way too many fake niggas who wanna just be around me
Foreign money and Foreign guns that's all I need around me
Not even a bitch, on bro n'em I can't trust em' (nah)
Bust today then you can bust away I ain't even tryna' fuck her
One thing about these niggas, if you flexin' keep a nigga back
Niggas snakes, niggas fakes, them niggas will get you whacked
Pull up foreign (skirtt skirtt) I'm flexin on these hoes
Bitch I only want the mouth, yea ho thats all I know
Head Shots, it's war time, Bibby tell me when to go
Man I can't fuck with niggas trigger happy just to blow
This .30 under this Gucci belt, cock back then we spazzin' out
Robin Jeans and True Religions, this rap shit, we cashin' out
New niggas out my circle, face shots we pass em out
RocBlock or No Block, fuck niggas we flashin' out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Herb]
Yea Lil Herb be takin' off so I got niggas hatin'
And they see my diamonds black and white, immigration
Kushy puffin' Remy tastin' Daily Trappin', Benji' Chasin'
Tryna' touch this bread but I got niggas at my head
Guess they wanna see me dead, or wanna see me in the feds
Cause' im gettin' it
And all they gonn' do is see me spending it
And now they wanna get with this but not when we was into shit
So if they on some stealin' shit I'm spittin' it
Faster than I'm spittin' this and faster than that new M6
When I drive the newest whips, just make me do the rudest shit
Might whip out on my newest chick like
"Yea what you gonn' do with this"
Suck it til' it's nice and stiff
But make sure you don't bite the tip, you triflin' bitch
Fake niggas all around me, in the water tryna' drown me
Just starin' and shit, playin and shit
Gonn' make me let this cannon spit
And cause some fuckin' damages, with alcohol and bandages
So try me and I'm blammin' it, no panickin'

[Hook]
