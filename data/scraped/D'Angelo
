[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout this girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See, we be making love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade blood burgundy
The way that we kiss is unlike any other way
That I be kissin' when I'm kissin' what I'm missin'
Won't you listen?

[Hook]
Brown Sugar babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
Ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh sugar when you're close to me
You love me right down to my knees
And whenever you let me hit it
Sweet like the honey when it comes to me
Skin is caramel with those cocoa eyes
Even got a big sister by the name of Chocolate Thai

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now that'd be how the story goes
Brown Sugar got me open, now I want some more
Always down for a menage-a-troi
But I think I'm a hit it solo
Hope my niggas don't mind
Stick out my tongue and I'm bout
Ready to hit this pretty gritty
Bitty with persistence
Yo, I don't think ya'll hear me

[Hook][Intro]
Si, me amas? Yo te quiero mucho. Todo el tiempo que pasamos. Lo que te quería decir es que… tu estas jodiendome la vida. *Laughs* Yo no quería pelear contigo. Yo solamente te quería amar. Pero tu eres muy celoso. Querías ser mi dueño. Pero yo soy libre. Quieres ser mi rey? Yo tu reina? No sé si confío en ti. Pero yo te quiero mucho.”

[Verse 1]
When you call my name
When you love me gently
When you're walking near me
Doo doo wah I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you

[Chorus 1]
When you look at me
I open up instantly
I fall in love so quickly
Doo doo wah I'm in really love with you
Doo doo wah I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you

[Bridge]
All night beside you I'd lay
I love you deep when you come to my bed
Doo doo wah, I'm in really love with you
Ooh wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you

[Verse 2]
When you touch me there
When you make me tingle
When our nectars mingle
Doo doo wah, I'm in really love with you, I'm in really love
I'm not an easy man, to overstand, you feel me
But girl your patient with me
Doo doo wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you

[Chorus 2]
All night I wish for you here
Lay your head beside my hip
Doo doo wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Doo doo wah, I'm in really love with you
I'm in really love with you
Oh how I love the little things you do
I'm in really love with you[Lauryn]
Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
Cause nothing even matters, at all
See nothing even matters
See nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all

[D'Angelo]
See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
Cause nothing even matters, at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
No-thing matters at all

[Lauryn]
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
Cause nothing even matters to me
See nothing even matters
See nothing even matters to meee
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me

[D'Angelo]
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
To look at you religiously
Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even mat-ters to me
Said it don't matter, baby baby
Don't matter

[Lauryn]
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
Cause nothing even matters, no more
See nothing it don't matter
See nothing even mahhh-ahhhters no more
Nothing even mahh-ters
Nothing even matters no more

[D'Angelo]
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
Cause nothing even matters, no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
No no more

[Lauryn]
To me, to me, to me, to me
To me, to me, to me, to me to me to me

(freestyle singing to end)[Verse 1]
Crawling through a systematic maze to demise
Pain in our eyes
Strain of drownin', wading through the lies
Degradation so loud that you can't hear the sound of our cries (doo, doo)
All the dreamers have gone to the side of the road which we relay on
Inundated by media, virtual mind fucks in streams

[Chorus]
All we wanted was a chance to talk
'Stead we've only got outlined in chalk
Feet have bled a million miles we've walked
Revealing at the end of the day, the charade

[Verse 2]
Perpetrators beware say a prayer if you dare for the believers
With a faith at the size of a seed enough to be redeemed (doo doo)
Relegated to savages bound by the way of the deceivers
So anchors be sure that you're sure we ain't no amateurs

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
With the veil off our eyes we'll truly see
And we'll march on
And it really won't take too long
And it really won't take us very long

[Outro]
Revealing at the end of the day, the charade
All we wanted was a chance to talk
'Stead we only got outlined in chalk
'Stead we only got outlined in chalk
Revealing at the end of the day, the charade
All we wanted was a chance to talk
Revealing at the end of the day, the charade
All we wanted was a (the charade)[Intro: Khalid Abdul Muhammad]
"When I say Jesus, I’m not talking about some blond-haired, blue-eyed, pale-skinned, buttermilk complexion cracker Christ. I’m talking about the Jesus of the Bible, with hair like lamb’s wool. I'm talking about that good hair, I'm talking about that nappy hair. That his body would be like beryl. Another scripture said his body would be like jasper. Another scripture said his body would be like  fine brass, as though it had been burned in an oven. Jesus: the Lord, the Savior, the Master, the Redeemer. Jesus, the Black revolutionary Messiah. Taken up on the hill, up on the mountain by Satan, by the Devil. And the Devil talked about a New World Order. The devil talked about giving Jesus all of this world out there, if Jesus  would just seek an alliance with him, if he would just bow down to him. And I say to you here tonight, devil: get thee behind me, Satan. Get thee behind me, Satan."

[Fred Hampton]
"Black people need some peace, white people need some peace. And we are going to have to fight, we're going to have to struggle, we're going to have to struggle relentlessly to bring about some peace because the people that we're asking for peace, they're a bunch of megalomaniac war-mongers, and they don't even understand what peace means. We've got to fight them, we've got to struggle with them to make them understand what peace means."

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I can't get over my fear
They're gonna send me over the hill
Ah, the moment of truth is near
They're gonna send me over the hill

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I'm so caught up in the thrill
Ain't nothin' (And nothing's) gonna change my will
Locked and loaded up, and I know the drill
(say know what I'm saying)
They're gonna send me over the hill

[Pre-Chorus]
I been a witness to this game for ages
And if I stare death in face, no time to waste
But oh!

[Chorus]
And if I charge it to the game before
Every time I slip into the unknown
Well that's only when the spot gets blown
It's war
That is the Lord!
I won't nut up when we up thick in the crunch
Because a coward dies a thousand times
But a soldier only dies just once
Once, once

[Verse 3]
Yahweh, Yehushua
He don't want no coward soldier
Aaah stick it in the golden sand
Musta didna hearda ma prayer
I receive everything that it means
And wield it victoriously
Aha, and cast out all the wickedness
(When they) send me over the hill
I was born to kill
Send me over the hill

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus][Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo Doc what up my nigga
Snoop Dogg, it is what it is mane
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
I think it's time for me and you to just, tone it down a bit
Come on...

[Dr. Dre]
Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin', imagine niggas trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if you never got this shit crackin
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in the City of God
You feel me, imagine life on the yard
Or tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called pop by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
So if you get back to the streets you get right back in
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam it's another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just try and keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been bless with hip-hop

[Hook: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years, with you mind - can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

[Snoop Dogg]
Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We act like we hate to see you gun ho
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like the niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's comin' when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggas got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jaildome
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell
Your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' of somebody's son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls
He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

[Hook] - 2X

"In the name of Allah, in the name of God
The benificiant, the merciful - the one God to whom all praises due Regardless of land, labor, or title
No matter what name you call God by whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must﻿ talk to God"[Verse 1]
Take a toke of smoke from me as you dream inside
Let your days slip away come with me and ride
My darling you aren't the average kind
You need the comfort of my loving
To bring out the best in you
I hope that you do
See what you've given to me
Separating, debating, stay with me that's all you have to do

[Chorus]
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
(No way) It ain't that easy
(No way) To walk away
(Just stay) When I want you to stay, baby
(Give yourself a chance) You can't leave me
It ain't that easy
(Okay) Ow ow ow

[Verse 2]
Ever hit with a choice that you can't decide?
Which direction left or right
Shut your mouth off and focus on what you feel inside
See y'all know I'ma go with my vibe
You won't believe all the things you have to sacrifice
Just to get peace of mind
And you take what they give as if it did suffice
Still it's just a waste of time
I offer you the truth
You need the comfort of my loving to bring out the best in you
I wanna give you give you something to feed your mind
No separating, no don't debate it
Faithfully we'll see this love through

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I got just what you need babe
All this love you'll receive, yeah
I been waiting so long

[Verse 3]
I tell you this sincerely
I need the comfort of your loving
To bring out the best in me
I'm gonna keep you
Safe from evil opinion
What I got can't duplicate it
Faithfully we'll see this love through

Africa is my descent
And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that's meant
Meant for many men not my tone

[Verse 2]
The blood of God is my defence
Let it drip down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat
From kings and queens becomes a prince
Knowledge and wisdom is understanding what we need

[Bridge]
And this game of love
Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own
And this game of love
Everyday I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive, I receive the love
That radiates from your glow

[Verse 3]
From which you came was love
And that's how it all should be
You and my soul are one
Though all the time and history

And I thank you, thank you[Verse 1]

[Chorus x3][Verse 1]
How does one attempt to be
The kind of friend that you would want to keep?
I just want to say to thee
Even though it might be hard to believe
The candy-coated thoughts that drift through my sleep
Lets me know it's you that holds the key
I got a craving for confection so sweet
For the taste of when our lips first meet

[Chorus]
Oh, in another life, I bet you wouldn't know that
Oh, in another life, I bet you were my girl

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take you with me
To secret rooms in the mansions of my mind
Shower you with all that you need
Take my hand, I swear I'll take my time
I'm not surprised to find that angels compete
For the chance to lay down at your feet
I'm gonna touch in all of the places that please
Pull you close
I wanna feel you breathe

[Chorus]
Oh, in another life, I bet you wouldn't know that
Oh, in another life, I bet you were my girl

It's another reason for the season
I don't wanna break your heart
Oh, in another life, I bet you were my girl, Oh![Verse 1]
Traveling at the speed of light and then
At the same time I'm in the same spot too
The room was kept in
'Bout the same way you left it
With about the threats you mess in attitude
Where ya' been with all your grin
Until all your friends turn their backs on you
Reminiscing over what you've been missing
Could be just like cousins kissing
That's taboo

[Chorus]
I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was
I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was
I used to get real high, now I
But now I'm just getting a buzz
I wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was

[Verse 2]
If you win, no matter if you lose
You got to come back again
Pay some dues
Back in Richmond, shit ain't changed a bit in
Niggas with a little piss in got some attitudes
I been wondering if I can ever again
So if you're wondering about the shape I'm in
I hope it ain't my abdomen that you're referring to
This what I want you to listen to

[Bridge x3]
Seasons may come and your luck just may run out
And all that you'll have is some memories, oh

[Chorus]
Said I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
I used to get real high
Now I'm just getting' a buzz, now, now, now
I said back to the way it was, now, now, now
I just wanna go back, baby
I just wanna go back, baby
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
Back to the way it was, now, now, now
I used to get real high
Now I'm just getting' a buzz, now, now, now
Back to the way it was, now, now, nowI just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna go back now
I just wanna go back now

The seasons may come and your luck may just run out
And all that you'll have is a memory, oh

The seasons may come and your luck may just run out
And all that you'll have is a memory, oh

The seasons may come and your luck may just run out
And all that you'll have is a memory, oh

The seasons may come and your luck may just run out
And all that you'll have is a memory, oh

Used to get real high
Now I'm just getting a buzz

Used to get real high
Now I'm just getting a buzz

Used to get real high
Now I'm just getting a buzz[D'Angelo]
I believe... that's love, that's love
I believe... that's love
I believe... that's love, that's love
I believe... that's love
I believe... love, love

[Q-Tip]
Uh, of the things we believe
There's a whole lot of work, we should roll up our sleeves
And we got to hold firm when fateful sight conceiving
Why doubt your plans? Cause it's all worth believing
We can make it work, do believe that
Weave mistrust in the dust and believe fact
We can achieve tact by tuning out negative feedback
Naysayers can hate, we concentrate to bring belief back
Into ourselves, into the world, into the rap game
Emcees are miserable, their music should be leaving mics maimed
Man, look we holding out for the truth
If we alone in the Louvre we gone hold for the proof
Man put it in believing, believe in believing
Seeing ain't believing, it's the feeling that we needing
Believe in each other, put the question to the system
They promising returns? Then question what you getting
We should believe in the reasons we existing
Time for Renaissance to reawaken what is withered
Belief can confirm, make it is what it isn't
Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't

[D'Angelo]
I believe... that's love
I believe... that's love, that's love

[Q-Tip]
In the land of make-believe, time to make unbelief believable
Taking belief to the realm of the real
Believing this shit that's force-fed through the media
Believing it's real when it's really a raw deal
Never disbelieve when you see human miracle
Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon
Believe in that, don't believe in stats to the contrary
Gotta be weary of them theories, carry on
People find belief when they don't find identity
Believe in your friends, don't believe in your enemies
Mountains of doubts and disbelief right in front of you
Troops on the other side, what you gon' do?

[D'Angelo]
Oooh... oooh, oooh, heeey
Ooh that's love, that's love
Oooh... oooh, oooh, heeey
Ooh that's love, that's love
I believe...
I believe...
I believe...[Verse 1]
As the day must have its sun
And the night must have its moon
Sure as both must rise and fall
I'll be there to see you through
Just as long as there is time
I will never leave your side
And if ever that you feel
That my love is not sincere

[Chorus]
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart

[Verse 2]
Like the breeze that blows in June
I will steady keep you cool
This I swear with all that's true
I'll take nothing in place of you
When you're feeling down, down, down
You, my soul, can depend on me
You don't ever have to fear
That my love is not sincere

[Chorus]
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart

[Bridge]
Through the storm, through the rain
I'll come running to ease your pain
Like the rails that cross the trains
Like the blood in your veins

[Chorus]
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart
I will never betray my heart[Method Man]
You and I, 'til the day we die.. (day we die..)

That big girls they don't cry, but they damn sure lie
Look you in the eye, sayin you they only

Leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I
Turn my back you try to fuck my homies, that was then
This is now I got a new friend, ever since
I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
About leavin the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me, now you on
Your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin mad ways to trap me, lookin at my girl nasty

"Now look at this bitch over here tryin to act like me"
"Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she what wifey leftover"

Waitin for the day that you front, and catch a lump
From my black butterfly, that don't pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her
In the mall and
Didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handled twenty-two, my Boo
She go ahead and walk her dogs, and represent Wu
To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one

Somethin, go 'head with that bullshit

[D'Angelo]
I'm still in love with babe (8X)

[Method Man]
Got tired of the games, the lies, the feeble alibis

Mad love but get no love nigga?? Stupid ass
Plus I heard that he be beatin on you, I seen him
At the club cheatin on you
Witcha best friend, got you stressin
And used up, pull your shoes up, all you need's affection
But you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryin to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin overzealous
Like you want somethin from Meth, I hope it ain't love girl
Cause I ain't got
None left for you, plus you miserable
Misery Love Company, shit I'm livin comfortably, don't need no
Nigga huntin me down for fuckin round, with his kitty
Talk to him, before my brother put a spark through him
Won't be pretty, the situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin high saditty with your slut committee
You know I know; so go find another sucker yo, I been there
And been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's, my, word! So go to your own with that there, word up
And tell that bighead nigga you run with that you was insane

[D'Angelo]
I'm still in love with babe (8X)[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout this girl, maybe I shouldn't
I met her in Philly and her name was Brown Sugar
See, we be making love constantly
That's why my eyes are a shade blood burgundy
The way that we kiss is unlike any other way
That I be kissin' when I'm kissin' what I'm missin'
Won't you listen?

[Hook]
Brown Sugar babe, I gets high off your love
I don't know how to behave
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
I want some of your Brown Sugar (sugar)
Ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh sugar when you're close to me
You love me right down to my knees
And whenever you let me hit it
Sweet like the honey when it comes to me
Skin is caramel with those cocoa eyes
Even got a big sister by the name of Chocolate Thai

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now that'd be how the story goes
Brown Sugar got me open, now I want some more
Always down for a menage-a-troi
But I think I'm a hit it solo
Hope my niggas don't mind
Stick out my tongue and I'm bout
Ready to hit this pretty gritty
Bitty with persistence
Yo, I don't think ya'll hear me

[Hook][Verse 1]
Let me tell yoU' bout the chicken grease

[Hook]
Chicken grease
Chicken grease

[Verse 2]
To get to the other side
Y'all cross the road
But not the kid see I'm like that old bucket of crisco
That's sitting on top of the stove
Simmer to a sizzle like the days of old
But I'll wait til I've mastered this, let the others go first
So the brothers won't miss
Fried til it's burned and crisp
Say we be cooking so the funksters can raise their fist like this
Now you know how its going down, start at your neck
Then through your back then it works its way down to your feet
So unique, come on everybody let's dance to the beat

[Bridge]
I just wanna put you down (yeah)
I just want you all to get down (yeah)
Everybody come on and get down to the chicken grease
If you wanna come on down to the front
Baby yo it's cool everybody faking the funk
I'mma put you in school, take a lesson from adolescence to man

Everybody on the floor if you listening to me
Clap your hands stomp your feet

I just want ya all to get down (yeah)
Everybody come get down to the chicken grease (yeah)

[Hook][Intro: Common]
Cold-blooded, cold-blooded, hard-core
Rough and rugged, rugged and raw
For you and your-your, for you and your
You got the C to the, huh - cold-blooded
Ain't it - huh, c'mon - hard-core
We take it hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-er
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Common]
My little daughter, started, nursery school
Brother Com, gotta make our move through
The stylist and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off
I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off
D be like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
?uestlove said, "We ain't got no time for that!"
My old bird like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
We're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
To seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep
I fuh-fuh-freak, styles that come out
At night, when most cats pull the gun out
Go on and on and, to the break of when the
Sound run out, run out, r-run out
C uhh, yeah

[Hook]
Cold-blooded (c'mon) cold-blooded, hard-core
(hit em with the) Rough and rugged (c'mon) rugged and raw
(hey) for you and yours, for you and yours
You got the C, uhh - cold-blooded (yeah)
Cold-blooded (c'mon) hard-core
(ain't it funky) Rough and rugged, rugged and raw
For you and yours, for you and yours
(Yo, yo I-I think I wanna taste these horns
I want you to taste these horns, c'mon now)
C, the cold-blooded (uh) cold-blooded (yeah) hard-core
(ain't it) Rough and rugged (uh) rugged and raw
(yeah baby that's what I'm talkin about
C'mon, give em, give us a little more)
For you and yours, for you and yours
C to the, cold-blooded (na, na-nasty) cold-blooded, hard-core
(c'mon) Rough and rugged, rugged and raw
(Yo, aight let let me get a little taste of this here)
For you and yours, for you and yours

[Verse 2: Common]
The simps, please uhh uhh uhh uhh
These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
On the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killin 'em soft
Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course
I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like Henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'mma end it wherever I land
I done thought of, a master plan, it goes

[Hook]

[Common ad-libs, then some vocal samples til end][Verse 1]
Baby let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused baby, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
Oh, this is not a one night stand baby

[Pre-Hook]
Let the music take your mind
And just release and you will find, baby

[Hook]
We're going to fly away
Glad you're going my way
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Music was made for love
Cruisin' is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

[Verse 2]
Baby, tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must, baby
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
Every little part of each other ooh, baby, baby

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 3]
Cruise with me baby, baby
Oh baby

Oh baby let's cruise, let's flow
Let's glide, let's open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you and love you, baby

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook: x5][Hook: D'Angelo]
Fuck the slice we want the pie
Why ask why till we fry
Watch us all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie
Drugs and thugs women wine
Three or four at a time
Watch them all stand in line
For a slice of the devil's pie

[Verse 1: D'Angelo]
Who am I to justify
All the evil in our eye
When I myself feel the high
From all that I despise

Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay in this bed I made
If I die before I wake
I Hope the lord don't hesitate
To get to heaven done been through hell
Tell my peeps all is well
All them fools whose soul's for sale
Sitting next to the Jezebel

Demons screaming in my ear
All my anger all my fear
If I holler let them hear
In this spinning sphere

[Hook]

[Verse 2: D'Angelo]
Main ingredients to this dish
Goes like this
Here's the list
Materialistic, greed and lust, jealousy, envious
Bread and dough, cheddar cheese, flash and stash cash and cream
Temperatures at a high degree
Wheres niggas come to feast
Hell's this all about
Apocalypse ain't no doubt

Everybody's ho'ing out all the loot all the clout
Right or wrong
Do or die
Only the vengeance will pacify
Watch your back
And so will I
In these days and time

[Hook]

[Outro: D'Angelo]
Ain't no justice
It's Just us
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Time has come for most of us
To choose in which God we trust
I know I was born to die
Searching to find a peace of mind
With eighty five dumb and blind
There can be no compromise[Verse 1]
Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Watchin' lovers do their thing

[Hook]
That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true, oh baby

[Verse 2]
When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet & low
When you touch me
And my feelings start to show, show, oh

[Hook x2]
That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true, oh

That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true, oh baby

[Verse 3]
In a restaurant
Holdin' hands by candlelight
Wanna touch you
Wantin' you with all my might, yeah

[Hook x2]
That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true, oh

That's the time I feel like making love to you
That's the time I feel like making dreams come true, oh babyGod bless...

[D'Angelo]
Hmmmmm..., doo doooo, doo doooo, yeah..., yeah..., oooh
Know I love my baby, My baby loves me
Layin in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

[Verse 1]
Searchin for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, I want the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparrel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rockin the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feelin at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God

[D'Angelo]
Geto Heaven...
Standin in some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven...
Standin in some Geto Heaven
Geto...

[Verse 2]
Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talkin to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cuz he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cuz one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will annoint you
Goin through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin him for
Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and God

[D'Angelo]
I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm layin in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven, ohhhhhh...

[Verse 3]
This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealin with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doin something you like to support daughters
Keepin your guys who collectin court orders
Conveyin messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hopin you could grow to it
Whether servin or a surgeon, you gon go through it
Can't imagine goin through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to Imhotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God

[D'Angelo]
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, yeah, yeah
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby...[Part 1: Greatdayindamornin']

[Verse 1]
Today, I played it safe
Cards are in my favor
Can't leave too much to chance
Woke up with time to waver
Yesterday was crazy
Mysteries I know now
Now I know the ins and outs of things
From day to day, that's how it goes
Don't get confused about it
Just try to do your thing
Cause in the end, got to know
Just how to play the game
I search for answers often
I paid the price for many
Still long for happiness
Not promised to the plenty
But I've got to go on

[Chorus]
Good days, bad days, halfway days
Good times, bad times, halfway times
Good days, bad days, halfway days
But I'm still looking for a great day in the morning

[Verse 2]
Today might be the day
I get it in the pocket
Lord knows if there's an angle
Got to try to find it, got to get over
Before the sun comes up
Just in case of an emergency
Got to tighten up, but here it goes

[Chorus]


[Verse 3]
I said today could really be the day
So don't go if I'm gon' be fine
My body could melt good night
Don't you let them switch you, baby
Said the most crazy mystery
Ins and outs of things, day to day
How they supposed to know?

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I know it gets hard
I know it gets hard sometimes
Gather the people
Said I got it all in my spirit
And I know this morning when I rose
Gonna be, got to be crazy, crazy

[Chorus x3]

[Part 2: Booty]

[Verse]
Everybody likes the morning, the morning
Sunshine in the morning, the morning
Said we make love in the morning, the morning
Pray to God in the morning, in the morning
Get it on in the morning, the morning
Take a shower in the morning, the morning
Smoke somethin' in the morning, the morning
Said it'll be all good in the morning, the morning
It's a new day in the morning, the morning

[Outro]
We getting down, down in the morning
Yeah, we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down, down in the morning
Yeah, we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down, down in the morning
Know we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down, down in the morning
Yo, we getting down, down in the morning
You know we getting down[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo Doc what up my nigga
Snoop Dogg, it is what it is mane
This record is so motherfuckin' gangsta man
I think it's time for me and you to just, tone it down a bit
Come on...

[Dr. Dre]
Imagine it never happened
Imagine no rappin', imagine niggas trapped
Imagine it havin' action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if you never got this shit crackin
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine it's like livin' in the City of God
You feel me, imagine life on the yard
Or tryin' to get that dollar on some shitty ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called pop by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son
Imagine life you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen you go right to the jenz
So if you get back to the streets you get right back in
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam it's another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just try and keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been bless with hip-hop

[Hook: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years, with you mind - can you imagine?
Paint a picture in the sky - can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life, all my life

[Snoop Dogg]
Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked ya why ya run for and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
We act like we hate to see you gun ho
But just imagine if the rappin' got the gun no but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like the niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's comin' when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean imagine we said fuck this shit
Imagine if my niggas got together and tow up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growin' up in the jaildome
Happy just to be alive' watching all your people run
Would you imagine growin' up to sell
Your 50 million records world wide or fuckin' of somebody's son
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets where niggas kill each other
All the drunk fool gets pissed on balls
He fuckin' off my niggas, they gone murder us all
Imagine that

[Hook] - 2X

[Outro]
"In the name of Allah, in the name of God
The benificiant, the merciful - the one God to whom all praises due Regardless of land, labor, or title
No matter what name you call God by whenever life seems hard
Everybody know that you must﻿ talk to God"Chorus

Said I got a jonz in my bonz
I said this feeling that I got
Won't leave me 'lone

Said I got a jonz in bonz
I said this feelin' I got
Goes long and strong

Verse

All my natural life I've been waiting
I've been holding on
To everything that belongs to me
Fooled, misled by every single possibility
What I wouldn't give to be
Next to the things that where meant fo’ me

Uh ooh

Chorus

On and on, on and on, on and on, on, on
Baby, shoo do doo da do

Chorus

Ad lib outCHORUS: You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady

Don't think I don't see them looking at ya
All of them wishing they could have ya
And as a matter of fact, uh
A bunch of them are itchin'for you to scratch'em
I'm tired of hiding what we feel
I'm trying to come with the real
And I'm-a gonna make it know
Cause I want them to know

CHORUS

You're my little baby, my darling baby
I swear you're the talk of the town
And everybody wants to know what's going down
Babe, I know they've seen us before
Maybe at the liquor store, or maybe at the health food stand
They don't know that I'm your man

CHORUS

I can tell they're looking at us
I pick you up everyday from your job
And every guy in the parking lot wants to rob me of my girl
And my heart and soul, and everybody wants to treat me so cold
But I know I love you and you love me
There's no other lover for you or me
You're my lady

BRIDGE (AD LIB)

You're my lady
My divine lady
You're my lady
Such a wonderful lady
I can't tell they're looking at us

REPEAT TO FADE
