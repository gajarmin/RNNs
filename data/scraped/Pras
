[Hook - Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 1 - Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates
Those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world
Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course
When giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pellet guns from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess, where I rest
No stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew
If you're doo-doo, voodoo
I can do what you do, easy, believe me
Fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone, I'll be Nina Simone
And defecating on your microphone

[Hook]

[Bridge - Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away
From these styles I got, oh baby, hey baby
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know
You can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3 - Pras]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushing up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die
Toss me high - only puff lye
With my crew from lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay[Hook]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, with his song telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

[Verse 1]
One time, one time, (one time) hey yo L you know you got the lyrics
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two times, two times)

[Hook]
Killing me softly with this song, killing me softly
With his song, telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Verse 2]
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

[Hook]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo L-Boogie, boy L boy L, take it to the bridge

[Hook]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song[Intro - Wyclef Jean]
One two - I'm bout to set this off!
Like this, hip-hoppers, check it

[Hook - Wyclef Jean]
Another MC lose his life tonight, Lord
I beg that you pray to Jesus Christ, why
Oh Lord, father don't let him bury me, whoa

[Verse 1 - Wyclef Jean]
I haunt MCs like Mephistopheles, bringing swords of Damocles
Secret service keep a close watch as if my name was Kennedy
Abstract raps simple with a street format
Gaze into the sky and measure planets by parallax
Check out the retrograde motion, kill the notion
Of biting and recycling and calling it your own creation
I feel like Rockwell, somebody's watching me
I got no privacy whether on land or at sea
And for you biting zealots, your raps are cacophonic
Hypocrite, critic, but deep inside you wish you had the pop hit
It hurts don't it, a refugee come to your turf
And take over the earth

[Interlude - Lauryn Hill]
See my rhymes, are the type of fly rhymes
That can only get down with my crew
And if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes
We'll show you how the refugees do

[Verse 2 - Lauryn Hill]
Yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
It's against the laws of physics
So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
Rap rejects my tape deck, ejects projectile
Whether Jew or gentile, I rank top percentile
Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
My grammar pays, like Carlos Santana plays "Black Magic Woman"
So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
You just embarrassed cause it's your last tango in Paris
And even after all my logic and my theory
I add a "Motherfucker" so you ignant niggas hear me
Crew remember take notes, as I sow my rap oats
And for you biting zealots, here's a quote

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Wyclef Jean]
You can try but you can't divide the tribe
These cats can't rap, mister author I feel no Vibe
The magazine says the girl should have went solo
The guys should stop rapping - vanish like Menudo
Took it to the heart, but every actor plays his part
As long as someone was listening, I knew it was a start
For me to get my chance, grab my pen and revamp
Do a cameo while everybody do the dance
Quick now, cause you running out of luck-a
Playing Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka
While you munching at your luncheon
I'll be planning your assassination, then hit you like the Dutchman

[Verse 4 - Pras]
I compress sound sets with my rap DBX
Then drop vocals on my 456 Ampex
Bring terror to the shop of horror
As she cry, "mi amor," the phantom dies in the opera
And to the younguns who carry gadgets
And kill six days a week, then rest on the Sabbath
Violence ain't necessary, unless you provoke me
Then get buried like the great Mussolini
And for you biting zealots, your rap styles are relics
No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet[Intro: Wyclef]
Pick up your microphones... Pick up your microphones...

[Hook:]
How many mics do we rip on the daily
Say, me say many money say me say many many many
How many mics do we rip on the daily
Many money say me say many many many

[Verse One: Lauryn]
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinkin' of all the kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons
Season change mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper
Get red like a snapper, when they do that
Got your whole block saying true dat
If only they knew that it was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular muzak that's whack
Plus you use that, loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style
Your atempts are futile, oooh child
Your puerile brain waves are sterile
You can't create you just wait to take, my tapes
Laced with malice, hands get calloused, from gripping microphones
From here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me
I get Inner Visions like Stevie
See me, essential from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed be like Khalid Muhammad
MCs make me vomit; I get controversial
Freak your style with no rehearsal
Au contraire mon frere, Don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego, we go, way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or Coleco-Vision
My rhymes make incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy or Leviticus, God made this word
You can't get with this; Sweet like licorice
Dangerous like syphillis, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Wyclef]
I used to be underrated, now I take iron, makes my shit constipated
I'm more concentrated
So on my day off with David Sonnenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out, Mazel Tov!
Problem with no man;before black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla
Momma always told me "You're one in a million"
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, "How does it feel?"
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guiness Stout
Brother brother can't you get this through your head
This is set up by the fed's they're scoping us with their Infra-reds

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Pras]
Too many MC's not enough mikes
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dicin' dynamite like Dolomite
Double do's been like I don't Dick Van Dyke
Star light to star bright the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef - "I wear my sunglasses at night"
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
And when the cops come lookin, I be bookin to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Driving in my fast car playing Tracy Chapman[Verse 1: Omega]
Where I was born, nothing is promised
My life is filled with less hope than the prophecies of Nostradamus
Omega marks the ending of predictability,
Birth of agility
Who will it be to test me and expose their futility
Iron like a lion from Zion
Stop tryin' so hard, I think I smell your brain cells fryin'
The family's behind you if you're worthy
Philosophies developed deep in the back streets of dirty Jersey
Troops with scully hats and Timberland boots
No more break-dancing for loot
Niggas hustle and shoot
In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals
Government funds are minimal
Oppression's subliminal

[Verse 2: Wyclef]
These days its hard for we to find peace of mind
Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line
Some dwell in hotels with Jezebels
A stone age and fall a victim to the Plague
Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend
One last kiss from my sweet serpentine
Eliminate, break, navigate
To rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconcilation came from my enemy-friend
Who said, "family don't bend, we stay silent till the end"
Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend
Stare into the air inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts that ain't even here
Like Alex Haley, take notes on this biography
My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang like my chitty bang-bang sh-bang
For the heads, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign, okay

[Hook: Omega & Wyclef]
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey
But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray

[Verse 3: Wyclef]
Nah, fuck that
Fifty-two pick up, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody, one false move and you'll find her body in the sea
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies, I'm far from a jive turkey

[Verse 4: Lauryn]
My circle it can't be broken open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin', tokin', chokin' on they words like smoke, and
Cause we soft spoken, doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your booty smells rotten and one day you will be gotten
See, jokers is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame, while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See, poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I seen the biggest niggas on the block get murdered and they deserverd it
Or so the beast said when they served it, that shit is nervous
So what's my purpose? Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired, I hope you like the hell fires
You'll be screamin' "Murder She Wrote" like Chaka Demus and Pliers

[Hook: Omega & Lauryn]

[Verse 5: John Forte]
We used to jump rope, but now we gun hope
Bustin' shots off of project roof tops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ock, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships, imagine full Glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin, gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the lightweights for thinkin' they important
The night pays in heavenly ways, ain't nothin' free
I acknowledgin' your family and steppin' to your B.I
You see I stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when they got beef, then jet down to South Beach
Yo mouthpiece is yappin', I hear it in your rap and
My family is thick so that bullshit could never happen

[Hook: Wyclef & Lauryn]This is the Fugees, Outsidaz up in here:

[Hook: Wyclef]
Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
.45 by my side, do he live?
No, the nigga die!

[Pacewon]
Zen, zen zen zen zen zen zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet went ****
"Desperado", new word for "rudeboy"
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy

[Verse 1: Wyclef & Pacewon]
Wyclef
Pacewon
Yo this was how the West was won
(Our motto, a true Desperado)
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James Character
(And get they bones fractured)
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tuff guys are feminine like Sheena Easton
Woman cry, woman cry, Son still dies
Thrown off the building like The Fall Guy
Caved in the grave cause you didn't know how to behave
Playin' cowboy now you sleep with the slaves
Who's the desperado, sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pacewon dies with both eyes on the jackpot
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming
(Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash)
Yo let's skip town like Harlem nights

[Verse 2: Rah Digga & Lauryn Hill]
We make moves in stage coaches
Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches
We be like noches, buenos
And I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R&B singers, perpetrating guns with two fingers
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) and write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours
Bust this scenario, can't no other niggers in the barrio
From North to Ontario, bust us when we in stereo
Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent, your no talent, cause your blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
Cause props is up, Digga's through the roof
Burnin' niggers like I'm 90 proof
And for all you head beaters
The lead eaters, the cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamacitas carry real heaters
I rock the Dooby and L rocks the Nubian twists 9-6
Motherfuckers gettin' dissed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Zee & Praz]
Yeah, when the OUT's hooked up with the Refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP
Comin' up on weed of all type
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes
(You've got to know when to hold them
Know when to fold them)
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your goldmine
(So ooh aaah achiga, Mamase Mamasa Mamakusa)
Fuck the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah me and that kid, um "What's his name?"
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health fodd store
While my whore slaps cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Fuck with OUT's it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million muthafuckas
So let's get high off the Fu-Gee-La
When the east is in the house, like I'm Blahzay-blah

[Verse 4: Forté]
When pandemonium strikes, at midnight
Full moon splits soft niggas in a lunatic
On some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick, don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor
City streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin', shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head, says your dead by manana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body dropped, behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge never till we yawnin'
Gun players regular front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents

[Hook][Hook - Mya]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1 - Pras]
Some got hopes and dreams
We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'mma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - ODB]
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets

[Pras]
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling "Ole!"
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K. to Cali

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[ODB]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood(Intro)
(*inhales, then coughs*)
Ay, nigga pass me the blunt
(Go get the fuck outta here, oh shit)
(*inhales and coughing continues*)
Ay, pass this over here man, so we can just cipher youknowI'msayin'?
(Cip, yo, this is for dolo son (*inhales*)
Yo, man, c'mon pass the blunt man (Yo champ, champ, champ)
Yo, pass the blunt man (hold it man)
Whassup man? (Yo, hold it up, aight, take the fuckin' blunt)
Yeah, whassup? (Damn) (*inhales continue*)
I ain't even get charged yet
(C'mon man, let's cip man about the good ol' days man youknowI'msayin'? (yeah)
See man, white man tryin' to keep this away from us man youknowI'msayin'? (Uh-hmm)
Cause they know when you grab this man
You just be ciphin' knowledge man, knowledge as we buildin' up man
That's why they want no brothers to be out here man, youknowI'msayin'?
That's why they try to make it illegal man (...you far, you far from reality...)
Yo, check this out man, this is, a natural herb man youknowI'msayin'?
It makes your body just and your mind just go to another...
(Yo, but hold - money you is talkin' too, much)
Yo, yo, yo man, yo we just ciphin' man (...talkin' that, pass the motherfuckin' blunt)
I know you Latin shit, burn the fuck out (I hate when motherfuckers do that shit)...

(Wyclef Jean)
Y'all know there's a lot of emcees but just give my CHANCE ON THE MIC!!
Open the, open the, open the, open the, open the, open the
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
Open the safe with no key, it's easier than battlin' me
Cause uh-uh, I'll make you walk like a doggy
Some say on and on, but they mean ON-ON!!
I got tired of that new style - BREAKDOWN!!
I have to take it back to the break of dawn
When Melle Mel was Melle Mel and Al Capone was Al Capone
Bootleg is sellin' now it's rap that's sellin' in the village
But I'm just privileged to makin' my home from my spirit
So when you hear me it's the man with the deeper thoughts
At night I can't sleep my brain keep movin' like a body on a horse
I don't stand, don't stand, don't wife me I construct on bricks
Some thoughts it wasn't until he said: "He sunk my battleship"
So hip-hip, load the clip, hip, I miss - DAMN!!
I pay my taxes so I won't mess with Sam
Ya hear the rhyme you stand still, some ask for refill
We move your thoughts so I can see if you for fake or real
Cause Buffalo Bill bit battle inside from my rap meal
And left me on a hill-hill, so when I battle no will
So mama should I kill a man like Cypress Hill, chill
I got no lawyer so I pleadin' my own appeal
How does it feel - when a monkey is your ill
In a J-A-I-L? I have no time to make bail
Saw someone to be macho like bitches that got the lyro
So they had it at bein' a heroes, where did their bodies go, only God knows
You got caught, between the fire and the hoses
You wanna battle? Bring your Moses
Forget what fun-what time Moses
And someone goin' down and it ain't Buster Douglass
Cause the roughest with the gun, becomes a pussy
So all the bad boy talk, come on cause I'm the nice dog, yeah hawk
Throw many fights in fought courts boss
Never lost, so toss a nickel and change your course
Say mama say mama say mama say what?

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill)
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality

(Lauryn Hill)
Aiyyo, huh-huh-hum with the bottle of rum and tip
Who walks really for lack of listenin' to the drum-set
You silly nimble bad as to my car don't put the bass
Oh on the table test coming at ya
You got caught all that toe with twenty-thousand legs
I'm laughin' arrogantly as your nostril bleeds hehehehehe...
Relax and max and drink a Gin on the Tech
Well their gatin' for another pirate to lose his neck, check
I got a call from Captain Hook in so quick
We used to be partners 'fore the clip stole my rapper
I had to be right cause you fight like it was a bitch
I had to change the rhythmic pattern and make sure it fit
So now when I go and see with she
I thought the pirates through a telescope
And bomb 'em like it's make-believe
Throw me my sword I out for my protection
Cause I might ship on landin' side and start an insurrection
A pirate had disguised himself as one of my crew
But I start shooting and had him shaking before he got through
Hey, hey guy the loot the booty, I formed like a ram
I gave an ultimatum and told him he could do time
But he argued and fought me, he tried to bust right
And so I took it upon myself to make the brother walk the plank

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill)
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality

(Pras)
Fo'-to-the-fo'-to-the-fi-fe-come
I smell the blood of an Englishman run son
Ya see the man cannot understand
The hammer and the barrel hum
So when I get them someone will know where the hell I'm from
Cause I'm sprayin' emcees with my mack ten machine gun
The hand that rocks will be the hand of the gun bum
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum is the drop of my snare drum
Freak-k-k-k-kin' is the beat of my tum-tum
Makin' emcees walk like a doggy, hah-hah, I'll make them walk like a doggy
It's like the blunt to the phillie, the ganja to the sessy
You can't write a rhyme without the roots men-mentality
Cause ain't no milli-vanilli but the kiddy with the skilly
To rhyme so dope I made up my own vocabulab-skilly
Missed it from a bomber-tacky lackin' all the bum
That get her to a to and fro, I guess they made me boy
So can I get the cheers, not the chant from cheers
But the chant from my peers that I know are really down with me (CHEERS!!)
Now that I mean those that been since the beginnin'
(cause some of y'all cut out when it started rainin')
Now check me at the movies I'm rollin' like Black Man
I didn't need Batman, he teamed up with the favourite - EH!!
Tell all your friend-friend, watch all your friend-friend
Cause some say are your friend before wanna dem bring you poison
So I roll by myself and that I carry my (BIT!!)
You wished you stayed around, you know my clip got the (LIP!!)
So empty your hooray, your hooray to your hip
And if your hip's a book you know you got to get off bricks man

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill)
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality(Wyclef Jean)
I'm Chill-Master-Nell of a thousand emcees
But how are you gonna tell the real rappers from these phonies
Cause he sees everyone with a deal with a record company
They go home, they write a rhyme, they think they ready to battle better
Some write forward, some write backward
I wait for them to get the cheeba-ganja then reverse yo
With a verse that's worse than the last one
Some say BOO! he's the po he used to diss Jamaicans
And Hatians cause you thought I was American
Ay Pras, remember that song they sang, YEAH!!
Go back to Jamaica, what's good is what's new
But now we move off with Uncle's with a trail-crate of COOLER!!

(Pras)
I'm from the island, the island I'm from is the strong island
Emcees must be right, when I syke from lack of freestylin'
Mind must be sharp until my holler girl, I get all in
Black stylin', ridin', Boof'll be trappin'
When they come to battle champ see the shoes flappin'
Huh, coolin' while I'm rappin'

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try

(Wyclef Jean)
Said if you write with pencil you must write with (PEN!)
If you have a rooster you must have a (HEN!)
Five plus five you know that equals to (TEN!)
Then spit the yellow man, check it to groove-to-groove site

(Pras)
One, two, I throw a flow to catch it
Three, four, back she know before the track miss
I FUCK ya when style go, to wreck this static
(But yo sister, grab the mic and do damage!!)
(Lauryn Hill)
Aiyyo I used to drive a hooptie, check me now Snoopy
Rollin' with the Jones' but I different home alone
See life's got no value if I ain't got no statue
Hannibal heads, I be the kid from "Timbuktu"
One, two, zip me-me, check the mic I'm ready
Three, four, please the army - "Oh God", with Uzi's
So what came first man, the chicken or the hoodie?
If the, hoodie came first then mans' name would be Nancy
To kill the Jesse James rough, step back, check your stance
I'll let you feel me like the chi-chi-woo-woo-boogie-man
You say I'm balanced but you're Silence of the Lambs
And when I call your name I say Candyman, Candyman, Candyman
(Yes I can, can, yes, I can, can)

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try

(Wyclef Jean)
Well I'm on fire (FIRE), FIRE (FIRE), FIRE (FIRE)
So let me re-light your viacom
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (COOL!!)
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (COOL!!)
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (COOL!!)
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (COOL!!)
All that movin' I call my nozzle you see I was an electronic
You listen to your lyrics in chime - your Panasonic
The ly-ly-ly-lyricaler, the di-di-di-digital
Pras take the mic man, you know you're really critical

(Pras)
Stall emcees, soft, put 'em up for-ah Death Row (yeah)
Rhyme and cultural, style and never old
Slashed the priest-fool, ooh, you're filth-swolled

(Wyclef Jean)
I say no to spliff but my friends still smoke ?Juano?
Coolin' it, coolin' it, coolin' it
Somebody chuck me-who the who'd you think?
Hold the mic, hold the mic, I shoot 'em
Down with my last one, last one, last one, last one and
(Boo-shoo-coo-coo!!) SMOKE!!
I got my bullet-proof and now to send my bozack

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try

(Wyclef Jean)
This rap goes for the brothers in the neigborhood
Who used to rap on a Polaroid - here comes Father Joe
Let me clock the block as I pull fo'-five
Boof Baf - I cut the block but got stopped
I used to play hookie just to see how good an emcee was
He said I bust a battle - aight, I still took a gun
No cheeba, cheeba just a Libra on a natural high
I waited so long that I thought I died and came back alive
So hear the spirits, many fear, ?Sir New Stosser?
This the new thing under the Sun, when I come, I come
Bam-bam, alakazam, he grabbed the pocket book, they ran, I came back with the bag
Cause that's my momma man
I'm just patrollin', Boof Baf'n the block
But the spot that I clock, you get shot if your numbers' about
So don't get caught in the fast lane, the fast lane
A just remain yourself and be the same
Cause many rapper-days, say nuttin' for nuttin'
So here's sut-um to take you from the am to the pm
(Pras)
Cause a imitator could never be greater than the creator
Whose the originator, step up infiltrator
See you later alligator - back stabbin' traitor
Tape recorder, duplicator, roughly rhymin' with the head tranzlator, hah!
AND LEAVE THE FORTY TO BE NAUGHTY IN THE FRIDGERATOR!!!

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck punk, try
(BOOF BAF!!), another sound of a guy
(BOOF BAF!!), never boy, duck...

(Wyclef Jean)
Say gun-man (BOOF BAF!!) say tell me where you get your damn gun from (BOOF BAF!!)
You musta get it from the foreign land (BOOF BAF!!)
We want to shoot up the old a Babylon (BOOF BAF!!)
Pay the man to rhyme onto it
Say gun-man (BOOF BAF!!) say tell me where you get your damn gun from (BOOF BAF!!)
You musta get it from the foreign land (BOOF BAF!!)
You want to kill your own brother man (BOOF BAF!!), ay, ay, ay (BOOF BAF!!)

(*undecipherable singing*)This is the Fugees, Outsidaz up in here:

[Hook: Wyclef]
Everyone wants to be a cowboy
Grab your guns boy
.45 by my side, do he live?
No, the nigga die!

[Pacewon]
Zen, zen zen zen zen zen zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet went ****
"Desperado", new word for "rudeboy"
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy

[Verse 1: Wyclef & Pacewon]
Wyclef
Pacewon
Yo this was how the West was won
(Our motto, a true Desperado)
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James Character
(And get they bones fractured)
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tuff guys are feminine like Sheena Easton
Woman cry, woman cry, Son still dies
Thrown off the building like The Fall Guy
Caved in the grave cause you didn't know how to behave
Playin' cowboy now you sleep with the slaves
Who's the desperado, sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pacewon dies with both eyes on the jackpot
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming
(Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash)
Yo let's skip town like Harlem nights

[Verse 2: Rah Digga & Lauryn Hill]
We make moves in stage coaches
Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches
We be like noches, buenos
And I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R&B singers, perpetrating guns with two fingers
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) and write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours
Bust this scenario, can't no other niggers in the barrio
From North to Ontario, bust us when we in stereo
Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent, your no talent, cause your blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
Cause props is up, Digga's through the roof
Burnin' niggers like I'm 90 proof
And for all you head beaters
The lead eaters, the cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamacitas carry real heaters
I rock the Dooby and L rocks the Nubian twists 9-6
Motherfuckers gettin' dissed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Zee & Praz]
Yeah, when the OUT's hooked up with the Refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP
Comin' up on weed of all type
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes
(You've got to know when to hold them
Know when to fold them)
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your goldmine
(So ooh aaah achiga, Mamase Mamasa Mamakusa)
Fuck the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah me and that kid, um "What's his name?"
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health fodd store
While my whore slaps cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Fuck with OUT's it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million muthafuckas
So let's get high off the Fu-Gee-La
When the east is in the house, like I'm Blahzay-blah

[Verse 4: Forté]
When pandemonium strikes, at midnight
Full moon splits soft niggas in a lunatic
On some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick, don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor
City streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin', shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head, says your dead by manana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body dropped, behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge never till we yawnin'
Gun players regular front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents
Life will keep existing while I'm shitin' on opponents

[Hook][Intro: Redman]
Hahahahahaaa
Follow... just do what ya feel and never follow
Never follow...
Just do what ya feel and we gon' follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Haha, Methodical

[Method Man]
Who wanna flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic, what we be smokin, Tical
The resevoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now
Man's down, hands down
Hold ground by yo' side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin bout Toni Braxton, blowin her back out like Bob Backlund
I'm throwin wrestlin holds
Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot
If it don't hip it don't hop
If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life

[Redman]
I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual
I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters
When I slaughter don't get, caught in the water
Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare
Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities
Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggas lookin hard at me, I Port 'em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin three dimes at a time
(Redman and Method Man still... "hiiiigh hiiiiiiiiigh")
It's that Jersey representer
Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter

[Method] Word...

[Redman] Just do what ya feel and never follow (repeat 3X)
Funk Doc break it down

[Redman]
Hah.. yo, suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze yo' camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shunt your million dollar investment, to economy
Impossibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin "Caution when wet by the track wetter"
The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga [chik-chik BLAAAOW] and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian
(Yo watch you say to him!)
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock the basement
You couldn't come close if I gave you my bookin agent
Or producer, royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up - you're still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator
Fuck you, your label moms and yo' editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin
All on my shirt, the king of the flirt shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
(Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet)
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung (one me gun done)
Get on the mic and break em off with sumthin sumthin

[Method Man]
We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sho' shots, it got me spittin
These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions
U-A-P ain't got no weapon, you lip professin
Next in, line, parental discretion advised
These explicit, street linguistics
Better than yo' momma biscuits, we bomb shellin
I might know but ain't tellin, too bad you missed it
Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Color-safe bleach so I don't fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp
Get yo' bandaids hold that
Like E said, Get the Bozack
Show them wack niggas where the do's at
On the case like I'm Kojak
Kissin the grits on that Flo bitch
Flip scripts take LOOONG shits - Raider Ruckus
One, I come with premeditated redrum
Gingivitis to your filthy ass gums
Bottom line either get down or get done
Motherfucker[Verse 1: Omega]
Where I was born, nothing is promised
My life is filled with less hope than the prophecies of Nostradamus
Omega marks the ending of predictability,
Birth of agility
Who will it be to test me and expose their futility
Iron like a lion from Zion
Stop tryin' so hard, I think I smell your brain cells fryin'
The family's behind you if you're worthy
Philosophies developed deep in the back streets of dirty Jersey
Troops with scully hats and Timberland boots
No more break-dancing for loot
Niggas hustle and shoot
In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals
Government funds are minimal
Oppression's subliminal

[Verse 2: Wyclef]
These days its hard for we to find peace of mind
Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line
Some dwell in hotels with Jezebels
A stone age and fall a victim to the Plague
Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend
One last kiss from my sweet serpentine
Eliminate, break, navigate
To rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconcilation came from my enemy-friend
Who said, "family don't bend, we stay silent till the end"
Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend
Stare into the air inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts that ain't even here
Like Alex Haley, take notes on this biography
My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang like my chitty bang-bang sh-bang
For the heads, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign, okay

[Hook: Omega & Wyclef]
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family that's the code to obey
But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray

[Verse 3: Wyclef]
Nah, fuck that
Fifty-two pick up, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody, one false move and you'll find her body in the sea
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies, I'm far from a jive turkey

[Verse 4: Lauryn]
My circle it can't be broken open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin', tokin', chokin' on they words like smoke, and
Cause we soft spoken, doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your booty smells rotten and one day you will be gotten
See, jokers is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame, while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See, poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I seen the biggest niggas on the block get murdered and they deserverd it
Or so the beast said when they served it, that shit is nervous
So what's my purpose? Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired, I hope you like the hell fires
You'll be screamin' "Murder She Wrote" like Chaka Demus and Pliers

[Hook: Omega & Lauryn]

[Verse 5: John Forte]
We used to jump rope, but now we gun hope
Bustin' shots off of project roof tops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ock, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships, imagine full Glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin, gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the lightweights for thinkin' they important
The night pays in heavenly ways, ain't nothin' free
I acknowledgin' your family and steppin' to your B.I
You see I stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when they got beef, then jet down to South Beach
Yo mouthpiece is yappin', I hear it in your rap and
My family is thick so that bullshit could never happen

[Hook: Wyclef & Lauryn][Sania]
Attention, attention, c'est le vol international Refugee Camp
Viens donc voir Lauryn, Praswell, Wyclef. Ils passent par Haïti, Paris, l'Espagne, tout partout, New York City. Alors viens voir seront (?) leur repertoire

[Wyclef Jean]
On était numéro 10, maintenant numéro 1
Wyclef, fils de prêtre, rappeur pas gangster
Quand je marche dans la vallée je ne crains aucun mal
Car tu es avec moi, chantons! Ouh la la la
From Brooklyn to Jersey, Manhattan to Paris
Fugees international like no other MCs
Like ichi ni san shi go roku shichi hachi [japanese: 12345678]
Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir, baby?
She looked at me and smiled, I started losing control
My french wasn't up to par, so I rocked in Creole
??? [cryptic creole]
Hié passém des calottes moins des berebés humbly
Même sous quand je football danier gol dans ces poupélés

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Ooooh la la la, it's the way that we rock when we're doing our thing
Oooh la la la, it's the natural light that the Refugees bring
Oooh la la la la la la lalala la laaah, Sweeeeet thing
[Wyclef]
She love me like no other before - hey

[Lauryn]
In New Jerus kids be rockin' now get down for they dough but
[Wyclef]
Mucho trabajo, poquito dinero
[Lauryn]
By soon I'll be countin' pesos with my peeps in Mexico
[Wyclef]
But for now I'm in Labamba pushing lyrics with the samba
[Lauryn]
Crews get confused when I say "konichiwa"
So I move from Japan and make plans in Korea
[Wyclef]
Like Na na na na an yang hashami ka haha soo lee serong omni hahaha
[Lauryn]
Ne pas imaginer ne pourrait jamais me détruire
Je sens l'effet de (???) de l'atmosphère que je respire
Ta mentalité infantile, Qui cause la mort, cause d'imbéciles
Qui pensent que la poésie est facile, des milliers ont continué à mystifier
En réponse faut réaliser, à travers les mots des réfugiés
Alors viens voir, c'est quoi mon répertoire
Si tu connais pas mon histoire, parce que les réfugiés sont là !

[Hook]

[Pras:]
Oui, oui - oui, oui, sous les grands palmiers
Je m'assois à quatre-vingt-dix degrés
Je joue avec la brise Dans les Ouest-Indies
Fruit de mer, envoie mes valises, Du bon vin fils !
Sous la (???)
They keep telling me this and telling me that
They smile in my face but they talk behind my back
But what they lack is the facts about my stats
My rap impact will kill you softly like Roberta Flack

[Wyclef Jean:]
Ayo, What's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Trying to front like he's down with Mount Zion (2x)

[Akon:]
Call Mister Martin, tell him to build a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs a get murderin'
Stop it! (2x)
A-haha

[Hook]

[Sania]
Attention, attention. merci pour votre présence sur la bande internationale
Camp de réfugiés, C'était Sania C'était un plaisir d'être avec vous
Alors, j'espère qu'on se verra la prochaine fois sur le vol international camp refuges[Hook - Mya]
Ghetto supastar
That is what you are
Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1 - Pras]
Some got hopes and dreams
We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'mma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - ODB]
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'mma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets

[Pras]
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling "Ole!"
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K. to Cali

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pras]
Yeah... yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[ODB]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood[ Hook : Khadejia and Product ]
The boys look so good but theyre minds are not ready
So here we go yall
Thats why Id rather talk to a man cause his mind is so steady
So here we go yall
Yo, the girl looks so good but her mind is not ready
So here we go yall
Thats why Id rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go yall

[ Khadejia ]
Friday night, see Im vibin and feelin right
Sunroof back me and my baby just had a fight
I gotta clear my mind of problems that I have inside
So I bump in my ride so you dont hear me cry

[ Hook ]

[ Product ]
Uhhh, the weekends here and Im chillin with my crew
You got me stressed and Im sittin here sippin boo

[ Khadejia ]
I wanna clear my mind of problems that I have inside

[ Product ]
Ohh, when I jump in my ride Im a try to loopb hold it all inside

[ Hook ]

[ Wyclef and Pras ]
Yo Yo Yo we dont like-a
A jealousy with envy
We dont like
When you smile and wanna blast me
We dont like
Stick up, give up your jewelry
We dont like
Suicide for milly or for dealy
What we like
Yeah is when we chill wit the herb
What we like
Is to drink in the Titanic wit no iceberg
What we like-a
Is when the thugs get hyper
Make sure what your brinme ain't carrying lice

Right about now if you ready for the ghetto princess Khadejia
Let me see one finger in the air

Da da da ( one finger in the air )
Da da da da daaah ( one finger in the air )
Da da da ( one finger in the air )
Da da da da daaah ( one finger in the air )
Da da da daah ( one finger in the air )
Daaah

Hey yo Khadejia Khadejia

[ Hook ][Intro: Wyclef]
Pick up your microphones... Pick up your microphones...

[Hook:]
How many mics do we rip on the daily
Say, me say many money say me say many many many
How many mics do we rip on the daily
Many money say me say many many many

[Verse One: Lauryn]
I get mad frustrated when I rhyme
Thinkin' of all the kids that try to do this for all the wrong reasons
Season change mad things rearrange
But it all stays the same like the love doctor Strange
I'm tame like the rapper
Get red like a snapper, when they do that
Got your whole block saying true dat
If only they knew that it was you who was irregular
Sold your soul for some secular muzak that's whack
Plus you use that, loop over and over
Claiming that you got a new style
Your atempts are futile, oooh child
Your puerile brain waves are sterile
You can't create you just wait to take, my tapes
Laced with malice, hands get calloused, from gripping microphones
From here to Dallas
Go ask Alice if you don't believe me
I get Inner Visions like Stevie
See me, essential from the chalice like the weed be
Indeed be like Khalid Muhammad
MCs make me vomit; I get controversial
Freak your style with no rehearsal
Au contraire mon frere, Don't you even go there
Me without a mic is like a beat without a snare
I dare to tear into your ego, we go, way back like some ganja and pelequo
Or Coleco-Vision
My rhymes make incisions in your anatomy
And I'll back this with Deuteronomy or Leviticus, God made this word
You can't get with this; Sweet like licorice
Dangerous like syphillis, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Wyclef]
I used to be underrated, now I take iron, makes my shit constipated
I'm more concentrated
So on my day off with David Sonnenberg I play golf
Run through Crown Heights screaming out, Mazel Tov!
Problem with no man;before black, I'm first human
Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure word to poppa, I ain't goin' under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Motolla
Momma always told me "You're one in a million"
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, "How does it feel?"
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
Cause the whole world's out of order
So at night the fiend's dance on Grease with John Travolta
One got slaughtered as he coughed blood from his mouth
The other tried to duck and caught a left with my Guiness Stout
Brother brother can't you get this through your head
This is set up by the fed's they're scoping us with their Infra-reds

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Pras]
Too many MC's not enough mikes
Exit your show like I exit the turnpike
Dicin' dynamite like Dolomite
Double do's been like I don't Dick Van Dyke
Star light to star bright the freaks come out at night
Like my man Wyclef - "I wear my sunglasses at night"
And my panache will mosh your entourage
Squash the squad and hide their bodies under my garage
And when the cops come lookin, I be bookin to Brooklyn
Leave the trails broken flippin' tokens to Hoboken
A clean getaway like Alec Baldwin
Driving in my fast car playing Tracy Chapman[Hook]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, with his song telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

[Verse 1]
One time, one time, (one time) hey yo L you know you got the lyrics
I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two times, two times)

[Hook]
Killing me softly with this song, killing me softly
With his song, telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

[Verse 2]
I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters then read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

[Hook]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
(One time, one time)
Singing my life with his words
(Two times, two times)
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly, with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly, with his song

[Wyclef Jean]
Yo L-Boogie, boy L boy L, take it to the bridge

[Hook]
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Yes he was singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song[Canibus]
If you just listen to my lyrics every day for a couple of weeks
My techniques will eventually kill you just like red meat
The Bhagavad Gita beliefs I speak be so deep
Most critics get mad because there's nothing to critique
Whenever I'm rapping or rhyming
With irrefutably remarkable timing
I'm like, Charlie Chaplin pantomiming
If you John Blaze, or you James Flames
Or you Jack Cremation, I'm Germaine Propane (Germaine Propane)
No pain no gain in this rap game
For the fortune and fame in order to remain
Most real MCs learn to adapt to the change
Or get washed away like tears in the rain, in the rain y'all

[Chorus: Wyclef +Canibus+ (Product) {Pras}]
Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
(When you in the streets and you're drivin in your V
If you can see what I see, you're prepared for the jackers)
+Old school, old school+
{Everybody got to pack a mac now}

[Canibus]
Yo, if you wanna know, how I kick a flow
When I rip a show, with my lyric-al, I'mma let you know
It's difficult, cause I'm a part spiritual, part para-physical miracle
And I'mma blackout in a minute too
Spittin like Bone-Thugs like
"Nigga-what? I'm-fin-to-get-a-gun and stick-em-up"
Then crush a Thug's Bones with a chrome slug
The black Cyrano De Bergerac of rap
With the ghetto Anglo-Sax' poetic syntax
In fact, nigga don't even give me dap when I see you
Just don't give me no ice grill eye contact either
When you see me, whylin like Beenie on the speakers
"Sim Simma-- who got the fire for my reefa?"

Chorus: Product, Pras, Wyclef

[Pro] You came home from a bid a nigga was in your crib
And the whole time you thought your girl was celebate
[Can] Old school old school
[Pras] You locked up and she need some di-ick
[Clef] Just ride, just ride, ah just ride e'rybody just ride
Just ride in the hood, just ride, all my .. uh, ah just ride

[Canibus]
Yo physically I move at a velocity
That'll break your stopwatch if you clockin me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji
Iller than what you seen in the cinema
A five foot eight, nigga with more horsepower than eight cylinders
My brain consists of twin Pentium chips
Double the clock speeds of a 586
And nothin about my physical matrix is BASIC
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like a Jamaican seein the snow for the first time
Rhymes of a sort, that distort space and time
It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind

Chorus: Product

[Pro] Crimes on the street, come from a lack of eatin
It's not my cup of tea, but I'll give them the BEST
Motherfuckin BEST
And if you still out here I kick yo' ass tomorrow
[Can] Old school, old school (c'mon!)
[Pro] And if you still out here, I kick yo' ass tomorrow
[Can] Old school, old school (c'mon y'all)
[Pro] Frontin like you buyin food but you buyin crack bottles

[Wyclef]
Ah just ride, ah just ride
Everybody in the East just ride
Ah just ride, ah just ride
Everybody in the West just ride
Ah to the South, down South
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah just ride[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Yo check it out. This is the boy Wyclef from Tranzlators, I'm coming from the
Booga Basement with a roots drink in my hands.  So put the Roots tonics in the
Air, yeah cause I'm-a start this one off like THIS!
Cause niggas are living like there ain't no tomorrow. I nuked this on the S900 cause I couldn't afford A 1100
I'm-a start this one a little something like this, here we go

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey yo people you're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You get caught in the terra asside em and ga morro
Father, forgeive him for he know not what he done
When the bum search for drums, the son search for condoms
He seek no, with his ring but with his head
That leave many dead in hospital beds; now you and death are newlyweds
So before I enter the tunnel I step back and shake it
Is it world the death or better life in a casket
Destuction of the flesh, new reporter wasn't coming
The devil cursed him cause he couldn't follow 10 commandments

[Hook:]
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You open up your eyes and them was ga marrow. WOO!
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up your eyes

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
I called up the VP, she told me she was busy watching TV with Roxy
I told her I was coming, she said that ain't necessary
Three's a crowd, so what's the philosophy?
Another girl trying to take my girl away from me, easy
Fuck the door, I jumped through the window
SOMEWHERE over the rainbow
Paranable and the bitch still in my home
Stick stick in your socket, I sacrifice you like a live rabbit
Fatal attraction the coffin's the cabinet
Cause in the 90's girls got dicks
So keep the light on and make sure that the chick don't that back
She said that she did it with some girl named Lisa
I said what's the boot yo, she pulled the camcorder
Bust it, so what's the charge, you called me a womanizor?
I tried to say sorrym she said say sorry for Taquisha
Chairs come flying my way like balls at basketball practice
Call the priest cause she's turning to the exorcist
She kicked me out cause she was paying for the apartment
That's real, you got no girl, if you got no money to spend
But she had loved me for my mind and my poetic skills
But bow I'm checking magazings and getting cheap thrills
Asking myself when will it end?
Cause when it came to sex, my hand was my best friends

Hook (Replace you're with I'm and me)

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
I had a cousin like a brother
He tried to play me undercover
He said I didn't bang her, but the girl was his secret lover
But I played stupid like my brain had no minerals
It's so hard to say good-bye we singing at the funeral
Girls smash it up easy, when they know they got the bugsy
He used to sleep alone, but now he's riding Mrs. Daisy
You say all my business my life's my life my knife's my knife
So I be the lion that guards the trife
But at the party, I still move my waistline
A girl approached me and asked me for the time
I said; no disrespect, but check the watch on your wrist
And if you're looking for a hit check Charles Bronson from Death Wish
Then All of a sudden her man pushed me from the back
I turned out real cool- I said why did you do that?
The name is Clef, Clef bon
Then mark my word that I'm-a break your fucking arm
Unless you apologize and pick on someone your size
Not too cookoo-hit you-but the 4 to the 5
Point it to your nose
Now your blood turns to snow

Hook
Yeah, word is born[Verse 1: Wyclef]
I woke up this morning
I was feeling kind of high
It was me, Jesus Christ and Haile Selassie
Selassie said greetings in the name of the most high
Jah Rhastafari
Christ, took a sip of the Amaretto
Passed it down the table said:
"Today I'll be betrayed by one you 12 Disciples"
Give me a clue who could do this to you?
The kid on the block who makes less money than you
Crooked cops pulled up, they offered him 30 pieces of silver
All he got to do is deliver the savior
Right on Bergen St. from bad luck to good luck
My cup runneth over, pass it down, guzzle up
The time has arrived, the prophecy will manifest
I saw death, I got scared, butterflies on my chest
Father if possible, pass this cup before me
Yo, it's too late I chose my destiny in Gethsemane

[Verse 2: Lauryn]
You see I loved hard once, but the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I'd die for, he wasn't even concerned
And time it turned
He tried to burn me like a perm
Though my eyes saw the deception, My heart wouldn't let me learn
From um, some, dumb woman, was I
And everytime he'd lie, he would cry and inside I'd die
My heart must have died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left, he stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops, that type of thief you can't arrest
Pain suppressed, will lead to cardiac arrest
Diamonds deserve diamonds, but he convinced me I was worth less
When my peoples would protest
I told them mind their business, cause my shit was complex
More than just the sex
I was blessed, but couldn't feel it like when I was caressed
I'd spend nights clutching my breasts overwhelmed by God's test
I was God's best contemplating death with a Gillette
But no man is ever worth the paradise MANIFEST

[Verse 3: Praz]
Gun-clap Shell cap
Got them crawling on they back
Come through with the Fu
They be who the fuck is that
It's unpredictable, when my tongue performs like Jujitsu
Cut you with my lyrics, stab you with my pencil
Lethal injection, witness protection
Refugee camp's under investigation
Gunshot bursts in all directions
For the wack MC's we read your revelations
Discharge through your pores
Get raw and kill Boors
I can Capleton when I'm on a Tour
Some manifest, with slugs in they chest
God bless all the Cowboys in the Wild Wild West[Pras] (Dante)
Uh, I mean I'm just sittin right here (California)
Ckeckin out these ladies right here, baby you hot
(This is where he saw her)
I mean you sexy, oh my God
(I long to love her)
Imagine one question: "Where you from anyway?"

[Hook - Dante]
She's Miss California, hottest thing in West L.A
House down by the water, sails her yacht across the bay
Drives a Maranello, Hollywoods her favorite scene
Loves to be surounded with superstars that know her name

She's a rich girl from the top of the food chain
Love and material things, kinda lonely
'Til I met her at the Grammys, ten mill' on a diamond ring
She invites me, to spend a day on the jet skies
At first it didn't mean a thing, then she told me
I'm the one that she searched for, it was hard to believe

Repeat 1

In a couple a days she had me a bracelet made
From Harry Hinstons' place, went horseback
Up to the mountain top, showin me the land she's got
Well it's alright but somthing else is on your mind
Looking past all that shines, now the tears are running too
All those things are nice but it's not why I'm here
I will wipe away your tears, simply by just loving you

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Pras]
Ah, aha, nah, yo yo
Ayyo she first saw me bling at the Source Awards
Toll the money in a fame when the world is yours
Til a ghetto superstar and I love to floss
Talk a player, bring my clique you bring yours
Bros' nah, they just want to mislead us
Breathes cheetas and tell us they don't need us
Midas up in the spot no skieses please believe us
We can get strange Evas, street G's

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

[Pras]
Uh uh uh, by the way I lick my lips
Cause you can tell I talk slick
Move like a pimp when I go to pick
Throughs my women like an unfill draft
First round second round, this is a no craft
"Como estas senorita?", cock back Cristal
Sip my corida, have some ice
But never I'm caressin, and you act raw nice
My flight with Paris, street G's

Repeat 1[Intro:]
A dedication to all the refugees worldwide... One time say, say, say

[Verse 1]
I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Brooklyn
Observing the crookedness as it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, good friends we've lost along the way
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say and to my peeps who passed away

[Hook:]
No woman, no cry, no woman no cry, say say say
Hey little sister don't shed no tears; No woman, no cry
Say say say

[Verse 2]
I remember when we used to rock in a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store for Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy for pain of losing family, but while I'm gone Shorty
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight, everything's gonna be alright
O everything's gonna be alright
The gun man's in the house tonight
But everything's gonna be alright

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I remember when we used to sit in a government yard in Trenchtown
Oba-oserving the hypocrites as they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had; Oh, good friends we've lost along the way hey
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say

[Hook]

[Outro]
And to my peeps who passed away..Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)
Go 'head and do it
Refugees, go 'head and do it (paper)

[VERSE 1:]
Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
That you've been trying to infiltrate my crew
It ain't no hiding from the Flava U
Don't get it confused, you ain't untouchable
(Go 'head and do it)
Now I've been trying to keep my cool like a queen
(Ooh, cool like a queen)
Bout to bring the Newark girl out of me
(Ooh, Newark outta me)

[Chorus]
Don't you know I heard you trying to take my...
While I shine, y'all live them fake lives
Don't you know I heard you trying to take my...
While I shine, y'all live them fake ass lives
All around me
(Haters try to play La, but
They know that they can't take her paper)

[VERSE 2:]
Everybody talking see
Spreading them lies about my friends and me
They say that we're tighter than suppose to get
That's because I haven't let you chill with me yet
You make it hard for a girl to roll
(Ooh, girl to roll)
But make it easy so my pockets stay swole
(ooh, pockets stay swole)

[Chorus]

[Pras]
That's right, yeah
Check it, check it, what
Check it, check it
Come on, come on
Yo, yo
Where my fellas at? Where my fellas at?
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies at?

[VERSE 3:]
As I look back on my life (check it)
To get where I am, I had to sacrifice
You slander my name in your magazine
This business gets hard trying to stay the queen
You're checking for me, you need to check yourself
(Ooh, check yourself)
And be someone, not someone else
(Ooh, someone else)

[Chorus]

(Flavor Unit, Refugee Camp All Stars)
Heard- Heard-
Heard you tryin' to take my (paper)
Heard- Heard-
Heard you tryin' to take my (paper)
(Why they wanna stick me for my…)[Verse 1: Canibus]
I make your bitch crew shit stools
I put a pistol in your mouth and pull then I feed you to the pitbulls
Don't even talk about guns
The only 9 you got is a 5 dollar bill and 4 ones
So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggas say
Cause anything that can't penetrate ricochets
Rhyming with me on a record, you might as well have died
And went to Hell instead of Heaven
Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampire's reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck mode
Explode leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in

[Break Pras (Canibus) |Free|]
Is that all soldier? (Yes, sir!)
Is there anything you need? (No, sir!)
Report back to me before the briefing, at ease!

(Are you a Navy SEAL?) |Yes, sir!|
(Then say it like you mean it!
Tell them who Free from the Navy Seal team is!)

[Verse 2: Free]
Free be the one rocking shit, special operatives
Specializing in weapons diagnostics
My survival tactics be drastic like Rambo
I'm strangling niggas with my bow and arrow elastic
Whoever said you couldn't be 5 feet and thoroughbred
Never witnessed the cerebral cortex in my head
How many gigabytes does your hard drive hold
Or does your hard drive fold once the signal hits the node
Beyond mission control the theory behind your thought
Marie Antoinette, behead me, I still rock
While you choking, suffocating off your own testosterone
I'm known to breaking levels down to the values unknown
A specimen with extraterrestrial oestrogen
Kick your intestines in, sell your testicles to Mexicans
I bring the force like a nutcracker
Annihilate rhyme hackers, Navy Seal linebacker
The last set of pits remains unclaimed
So if you buck against Free you better tattoo your name
On your teeth, I disintegrate those that oppose
Disintegrate hoes with they assholes in they nose
I suppose you wanna run your mouth like castanet
I put bitch niggas to rest in a bitch bassinet

[Break: Canibus (Free)]
[Canibus] Is that all soldier? (Yes, sir!)
[Canibus] Is there anything you need? (No, sir!)
[Canibus] Report back to me after the briefing. At ease!

Are you a patriot? Sir, yes sir!
Then say it like you mean it!
Tell them who Canibus from the Navy SEAL Team is!

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitch-ass niggas and bitch-ass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 4/5th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual I'm as different as anybodies fingerprint is
If boring is the norm, I'm the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt-naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you to scared to do shit
I'm the type of nigga that will prove it, produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I'll survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod

[Pras] Is that all soldier?
[Canibus] Sir, yes sir!
[Pras] Is there anything you need?
[Canibus] No, sir!
[Pras] Report back to me after the briefing. At ease![Hook - Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 1 - Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates
Those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world
Everyone would have a gun in the ghetto of course
When giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pellet guns from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess, where I rest
No stress, if you don't smoke sess, lest
I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats I make treks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew
If you're doo-doo, voodoo
I can do what you do, easy, believe me
Fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone, I'll be Nina Simone
And defecating on your microphone

[Hook]

[Bridge - Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away
From these styles I got, oh baby, hey baby
Cause I got a lot, oh yeah
And anywhere you go
My whole crew's gonna know
You can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3 - Pras]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under pushing up flowers
Superfly true lies, do or die
Toss me high - only puff lye
With my crew from lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border like I'm Cassius Clay"And when you feelin down.. recharge!"

[Wyclef]
Now and, forevers, them emperors, are nova
The lovin, the huggin, will never be over

[Pras]
Back up back up boy, don't get me started
Still the MC, hit the target, you get bombarded yeah
Affect the minds, let the blind evaporate
Let me elaborate, ohhhhh nooooooo (it's too late)
Push the button, cause I'mma get ??
Pass me a SCUD missle, so I can bomb the land

[Wyclef]
Yo Pras (what?)  Yo Pras (what?)  Some start to wonder
Some see lightning, some hear THUNDER
Shades of a black man, maybe the black panther
Makin MC's run when it come to rappin I'm the Darth Vader
I'm not regular, consider me ir-regular
From the regular rapper ones that lumber
But I come from a slum where many bum
Sometimes I cooled out, while my boys were in prison
I always told them that right, overrules wrong
Cause ever since a boy mama told me judgment they will come son
So I watch what I do, what I say, how I PLAY
And hope that I make it through the next day
Cause the streets are like a jungle, they got me say
OH-AY-OH-AY-OH, cause Tarzan's a black man
So I'm waiting for a break in the record company
So I could take you MC's, back to camp I mean
Cause with a flick of my wrist, I come rewind another RHYME
I got more rhymes than a church got WINES
Ever since middle school, I used to, rule
The kick of a mule, people called my talent beautiful
Never lost a battle, they thought I was buckWILD
Beat 'em by a dozen, I ship them to MosCOW
They didn't know that a ReFugee could rock so well
So here's the resurrection, of Pras, Wyclef, and L

Check me or my team as I recharge your body (4X)

[Pras]
Livin to be given, chillin like Bob Dylan
Like Michael I'm Thrillin, I'm not dealin to be illin
Runnin a massacre, like the task force
The cause is laws, the laws that broke your jaw
Now I'm, gettin raw on a thing like a mean machine
(Why you runnin around with the same old thing?
Humm.. you know what I mean, yeah)
I search and search, I start to faint
But never never never fall in entertain
Don't beam me up Scotty, I'm audi like John Gotti
Drivin in black Caddy

[Lauryn Hill]
Success for the next man is success for myself
Vanity's vanity yet I still wanted wealth
I know there's a true God, but it still makes me think
Of Yusef.. now is the notty dread dead?
Believe in the Bible because it promise eternity
Six six six, that makes you, my adversary
So I, watch my back and hopin I don't get taxed
I used to, rip the rapper cause they said we'd been said wack
I know what the critics they say, keep it commercial
I used to freestyle, but everything now is rehearsal
I miss the old school, so tell me what will I do?
I guess I'll start a revolution with the Tranzlator Crew, so..

[Wyclef]
Check me or my team as I recharge your body (8X)

Check it out all MC's I'm about to pull out my slingshot
Here it comes!

[Wyclef]
They label me (WHAT?) the MC psycho
Prim' you up, but don't mistake me for Sunoco
Cuss to get loose, now you got the micro' Joe
Who talkin about hope?  Poquito dinero
Means I work hard, but got no money, and that ain't funny
Hey honey when you work for free see it's hard to get a lady baby
But they say good things come to those wait
So I wait, no ego trip, and on the mic I penetrate
Elevate as I battle for high stakes
Many gamble, I eat you like an ANIMAL
Cause he gambled for the dime that he didn't have
He woke up in a dream and found his body in a body bag
Wyclef pissed cause, oh what I really said is
Is I'm that funky, big up def in pig latin man, hah
A lot of rappers try to outrap, but miss me yo
But I'm askin every teachers everything he know
There's always one trick, to make em slip
So let me predict in pure trick I'm sure the rap form will recharge

Me lick me one, me lick me one one
Me lick me one, me lick me one one
Me lick me onnnnnnnnnnne
Me come for them alllllllll
Me lick me one one one, lick bumba rum

Soldier man... them a fire lsr
And them gun shoot for.. woy!

[undecipherable chat](Intro/Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
Delivered straight from the temple
Hip-hop ya don't stop
One o' clock, two o' clock, three o' clock, ROCK!!

(Lauryn Hill)
Well as an infant I was born into religion
My mother called me Baptist but what she forgot to mention
Was just what baptist meant! The story goes: God sent
His only begotten son who gave his life
To make sure that I would have one
As I learned in Sunday School, is God took care
Of who's ready to disrespect, my mother and father would be Taboo
But as I grew, I met a Jew, a Catholic
And a Protestant just couldn't figure out where Baptist fit
Hastily I pray thee that ya make me see
Why thou has confronted me with such ambiguity
Are you Jehovah? Or Buddha? Or shall I call ya Allah?
All due respect, Heavenly Father
I just like to be a scholar on the subject called theology
So that time I figure
While they call themselves Christians, ya still call me nigga
And off to store a black hole leaves no control over thought
I leave my body to see the pits
Go high when the physical takes control
No communications with the inner self
The prize is the up the wise, wise who has a spiritual health
Now to explain they had the problems/visions of gettin' along with herself
She bought a corner, cornered herself and becomes a mourner
Logic brothers...
(Ahhh, yo sister can Praswell and Wyclef get some, check it out)

(Chorus: Wyclef Jean)
(Chorus)
(Wyclef Jean)
Delivered straight from the (TEMPLE), I had no time to (SAMPLE)
My cousin's name was (SAMUEL), I wasn't allowed to use the turntables
My dad was a preacher, so rap music was pure devilism;
And if it wasn't sayin', "Thank You Lord!", I couldn't listen
So I used to sneak to listen to DJ Red Alert
To check the competition, or DJ Red Alert goes berserk!
Cause as a young lad, I had a big rap pad
Cause he who wanted to practice would someday be the greatest guy
So I checked them as they flippin' sometimes
They're not flippin', they think they rippin'-rappin'
The only rappin' they doin' is in they room before they packin'

Pras:
You gained the world sucker, but you lost your soul
(The devil approach you us, all you do is tell a foe

Wyclef:
Life after death could be eternal fire
So some get blunted but you're back all on this when it's all over
Mama said a blunt was a stunt to the brain
So son say, "I don't smoke!" but on the sneak-tip he sniff coke!
He won the lotto, now he dies of an overdose
While the bum he picked a hole to sleep he wanted a deep throat
So ask yourself the question: Who's really maxin'?
Cause some check in but don't check out and either Hell or Heaven high
But to some Earth is Hell and Heaven's death
So they predict to be Haiti's and kill till there's nothin' left, hah
But I'mma hit'em with a gun, that's harder than all guns
Mic check from the temple, check the Tech
(And start the nuzzle to get wreck)
Can I get a witness? (Check the Tech)
Get wreck (Check the Tech), check the Tech
(And start the nuzzle to get wreck), can I get a witness?
(Check the Techs), here we go yo
Well I arrive let me tell you what I see in my third eye
Many die they call a battle, they got crucified
Justice, is righteous, in the eyes of the beholder
While the, younger the better but the, older the wiser
Mama used to read in deep from the book of Proverbs
But the bird said the word was absurd, have ya heard?
Knowledge - I come to teach while I increase ya decrease
Some say peace, but on a street a .45's my piece

(Pras)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise be to thee
Jah Almighty - COME!!
On the nineteenth of October I remember
Startin' my life as a natural leaver
Cause I lick one-two-three-four-five-six-seven shots
While any priest here builds his church on a solid rock, hit me
So feel the spirit comin' from the Heaven above
(Ay, Pras, how could you be a hood in full of so much love?)
I said: On every man chest there breathes a heart
Hip-hop where it starts, I tried to master the art, come on!!
