[Verse 1]
I'm really not a rapper, I'm real real street wit' it
All I did was take my life and mix a little beat wit it

The type of cat that call my dogs and have 'em where you live at

What the fuck you in the club fo' I told you on the phone
You niggas want talk, talk time is ova now
Diggs run the West and I'm bout to hold it down
Diggs from the Crest so whatchu gon do wit me
100 more niggas where I'm from just as rude as me
Cali need a leader, I'm the nigga with the torch
Take the 80 to Marine World exit to the north

Do it on some gangsta shit plus I can really rap
Feelin' that?, S-Dawg, a BMF track

Get the fuck out the way, you ain't the man no more
There's a new nigga here and his name is Diggs
And if it sounds like I'm talkin to you I probably is
You niggas in the way, ya'll holdin up the bay
You niggas fuck wit snitches, now what ya'll wanna say?
Ya'll take 'em on the road, ya'll let 'em book ya shows
They sent by the FEDS man to ova look you hoes
Family Productions that's a police front
And if you fuck wit the police you a police punk
Told this nigga B-La man Tony a rat
He say, "He ain't tell on me!", man how phony is that
These rap cats is plastic, flipped liked a mattress
Do so much rappin these niggas tell wit' out askin
I'm here for you Cali, I know watchu need
Some more gangsta ass music to go wit' your weed
Some more gangsta ass music to go wit' your weed

[Hook]
I need my niggas and bitches to help me rep that

Diggs, Thizz Ent., BMF, S-Dawg
Yeah, Ahh, What, Ahh[J-Diggs]
I gots this saucy lil' tender
Baby bad to the bone
Disrespect lil' mama best to know it be on
I go hard for baby girl
I can't help but to dig her
A lil' jealous cause I know she got more than one nigga
The way I figure its cool if you're treatin' her right
You best be suckin' her, fuckin' her, and eatin' her right
You want the truth
I done bust shots for baby before
For niggas neglectin' and disrespectin' my ho
"Hell no! You lost your mind? Is y'all crazy?"
This is my bitch, I love her, and she havin' my babies
We been together since the top
When I was jockin' the corners
Was only 10 when I met my lil' friend California
Stumbled up one her when I was like ridin' my bike
Come to find out, Cali gets live at night
She hang wit Bay boys
And bangers called Crips and Bloods
She taught me how to hustle sellin' dimes and dubs
We made love on the daily
I was payin' her dues
Cali taught me the game
But Cali changed the rules
Confused, I never knew better
Used to sweat her for cheddar
She seduced me, and used me, from the day that I met her
She had me body guardin'
And I'm jump-startin', and I'm drive bying' and dischargin'
High speed chasin', false statements to the sergeant
I was so young and so dumb
The time, had no funds
But fuckin' wit young Cali
I got more dope and more guns
Put me on her turf and made me hustle for her trap money
Whispered in my ear "If you do good I'll give you rap money"
Sat me down one night so she can whip me wit some game
Gave me pen and pad, equipped me wit some slang
Told me that I'd write about the life that she had laid out
Keep her name alive
And make sure she never played out
Represent that place where we met on that Cali corner
Let the world know I got a thang for Mrs. CaliforniaIntro (Mac Dre & Miami the Most)
Give me another Bitch Man
You didn't peep than man?
I need a bitch thats papered up (around here)

Back in December, or was it November?
It's kind of shady, I can vaguely remember
I was at the Peppermill, popping at the bartender
She made me a drink called uh, Bodybender
That's when a smurf pulled on my shirt
Said (Hey, get off my girl, dog, before you get hurt)
I said, "Hold on, I don't know what you think
You better back the fuck up and let me order my drink"
He backed the fuck up and did more than you think
He had a AP, not a nine, but it's sort of the same
So now it's one lonely R-o-m-p
I'm all by myself without nobody
Slightly noided, since death, cannot not be voided?
Somebody slammed the do' on the way comin from the toilet
He looked back, then I pulled out my strap
Slapped him it twice but uh, I should've blapped
Cause this other goon nigga started wildin
I pulled out my faulty phone and started dialin
Told my niggas to come on the double
They finna put a nigga on the goon show, bust his bubble
They said yeah, you know we comin
"But damn my nigga, you always into somethin"

[VERSE 2: J. Diggs]
Recently, June 4th, released from jail
About to hit the streets like a beast from hell
It's that nigga y'all done heard about, young J. Diggs
Love to play the game and I play big
I see suckers havin money and I gots to have some
You in the double R, I gots to have one
I'm all up in his backdo' like knock-knock-knock
The nigga moved too fast, so I pop-pop-popped
Should've stood still, there would be no firing
But it's a little late, all I'm hearin is sirens
So now I'm in the wind like leaves on trees
I'm in the crowd tryin to blend like d's on v's
I'm sweatin bullets, I'm an ex-con out on parole
What the fuck was I thinkin, I'm out of control
I'm at the Romp House and I'm huffin and puffin
My niggas lookin at me crazy cause I'm always into somethin

[VERSE 3: Sleep Dank]
Yo, we fuck with heavy guns, fuck around and pump heavy slugs
We drinkin Rémy doin heavy drugs
Nigga, we stay explosive, it's about a quarter to six
Step out the limousine, my wallet's 'bout a quarter inch thick
Nigga, we shittin on em, I pop the three-piece, savage
So many carats up in my ice I could choke a rabbit
Bitches screamin for me but all it took was one dirty look
We hit that nigga with that murder book
Nigga tried to step fast, hit him in the face with a Moët glass
Spilled drink on his bitch, the whole club hit the do' fast
Trunks is poppin, niggas wingin in the parking lot
We keep it gangsta with them choppers out
S-l double, I smell trouble, boy, it's nothin
Keep your peace, muthafucka, I'm always into somethin

[VERSE 4: Da' Unda' Dogg]
Let me tell you somethin 'bout a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Cause niggas done switched up, I guess they got it mixed up
Now I'm a dust the heater off my shelf and leave em bitched up
Like this one nigga actin like a dumb nigga
S-in on his chest with no vest, yeah, he a dumb nigga
Ain't no love in this thug shit
Now he at the club tryin to hug on my thug bitch
Plus she done gave me the run-down on how this nigga run round
Town speakin on my name, tonight he get gunned down
His bitch about to set him out, open the door and let him out
Caught his ass headed out, Bronc style, dead him out
Never have beef with a nigga who bitch you wanna sleep with
Cowards get devoured on that sweet shit
Hit him with the venom, then bounce with my adrenaline pumpin
Yo nigga always up into somethin[Intro:]
"Na na na na naa na!" [x8]

[Verse 1:]
"I'm riding down the grove in my black Deville
Looking for some pro's that perhaps can chill
High as I glide by Summerhill
Bathing Ape, Lacoste, I'm dressed to kill
Can't be swerving, my cup could spill
My pimp game worth 'bout a half-a-mil
I'm heavy in the trunk, so the front pop a wheelie
Her face be an eight, and her ass is so pretty
I step into the room & illuminate the haters
They hating on a kid, cause I'm a super-fly player
Heavy hitter, rhyme spit'er, ***** now or later
But still I get respect from Detroit to Decatur
Here to get paper
After that I'll see you later
Big and I'm major
Homie you a faker, faker
This is where I take ya
Go head, do your thing
While you do your thing, I'm a do my thing chuuh!"

Never out of line, I keep my girls in check
From the bottom to the top of the deck
I ain't no chump nigga I demands respect
We stay high, yeah we puff the cess
Weed on my breath, diamonds on my neck
Tatted up, I splatter guts when I sex
She gave it a test drive, she never drove a Lexus
See when I'm in your city man they treat me like Diddy
Got to give a shout out to my cousin frank nitty
Fly by-coastal from LA to Philly
Excuse me if I bump you, I'm a little bit tipsy
You can ask fifty, my city's so gritty, gritty
Ho's say they miss me, but still they know the dilly, dilly
Digga stay crispy
See I'm a do my thing
While I do my thing, you go do your thing chuuh!"

I'm really not a rapper, I'm real real street wit' it
All I did was take my life and mix a lil beat wit it

[Verse 3]
If 'Pac was here, he'd probably pull a mag' on you niggas

Really been around the world wit girls getting change
See my shoe strangs, they tied and laced up
And if I'm playin poker, I'm Jokered and Aced Up

"Me and my dudes roll in the disco
Mean with the shine, with a sheen like Crisco
Get my Quota up by the end of the fiscal…
I'm gone be draped from my toes to my lymph notes
Yea the boy Diggz split wigs, so lets go
Down to my dungeon where my playmates go
Lookie here little nigga I don't joke
Long dick is vicious, bitches call me the pope
Yea the bass bump, feel it in the back of your throat
Get your heart rate pumping like a rail of the coke
Heard your girl pop pussy and her panties are soak
Plus she like being dominated, pass me the rope
Pass me the soap, make sure I'm fresh as a loaf
Boyo loco, better have my money I hope
See I'm here to get smashed, maybe palm some ass
Now tell me, have you ever met a nigga like thaaaat!"

[Chorus:]
"Lookie here, you ain't never heard this before
Lookie here, you ain't never heard thisss
Lookie here, you ain't never heard this before

Now gimme dat, gimme dat , gimme dat [x3]
Gimme dat…
Gimme dat…"

[Verse 2:]
"Me and three cuties in and out the backstreets
Two of them naked making out in my backseat
Headed to mi casa for drinks and pasta
Bout to get wild, got them doing the cha cha
The boy don't stop, won't flop, I'm killing it
You just pissed nigga cause your chica be feeling it
I'm known round the world, girlfriend no lie
Jdigga nigga yes I'm really so fly
Girl you look tired come and lay on a guy
Maybe if you ready, baby we can get right
Profession-ale when I'm laying the pipe
Moi caliente when I spit on the mic
Yea there is something bout this nigga, bitches say I'm they type
Say they want to roll with me, take a spin on my bike
We can get up in the ring, you can put up a fight
Either way, I'ma get inside that oochie tonight!"

[Chorus][Chorus]
Move mean, move mean, move mean(X4)
Ugh

[Verse 1]
He was from richmond one of the sickest places in the bay
Nah he was from oakland, fresco, berkley round that wack
Over there by delagram, nah over there by ashmond
Why did they find his body in fairfield, don’t ask me
A neighbourhood mvp, programmed to go
But everybody in the bay knew he had it comin though
His mama was a ho his daddy on blow
Neva went to church so he neva had a soul
But this is just an example of how tha shit go
But that’s during sacramento, stacked in that Tracy Pennell Pittsburgh
Anne hack in the white house
Northern california west coast to the death
They call me 40 water, holy water on my chest
From the hillside to crest they say my city is a mess
One minute the babies born, next minute he laid to rest
Law enforcement under staffed we put the police to the test
A nigga die with two thumpers on him first time he wore a vest
That’s why

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I’m out here right where the knocks at
Got the 40 Glock, cocked in my jock strap
Tinted windows round here, betta park that
I don’t play a put one in ya hard hat
I’m two slick diggs quick to move
When I get in a nigga’s ass I got shit to do
Playa slash coach I call the shots
And just like the roach I know all the spots
I’m all in the attic and under the house
I’ll wake ya ass up with a gun in ya mouth
I switch cabs, cars and buses
Might work a neck brace or borrow some crutches
I come through limpin, hoppin and bustin
Can’t find who I’m lookin for I’m poppin his cousin
Shit gettin funky I’m the talk a the town
Hits anything movin and knockin it down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Philmore rich what up 40 yeah
Bang bang motherfucker this is what it is
Reputation alone came by the hundred years
Feds say we selling dope these niggas tellin jokes
I’m a star niggas watch me through a telescope
Rap shit is easy shoot it like a free throw
Opportunity knocking I’m watchin through the peep hole
Product a the projects, popeye and the pirates
I was only 9 introduced to the process
Money being made that’s why they hate me
In the lab cooking looking like a bakery
Fat nigga clean, lookin like a millions
Good with my words give a bitch a good feelin
Philmore legend speak to em like a reverend
Try’na see a meal before a nigga go to heaven
3 storey is the game street cred the machine
I’m a frisco ball so young dude move mean

[Chorus][J-Diggs]
I gots this saucy lil' tender
Baby bad to the bone
Disrespect lil' mama best to know it be on
I go hard for baby girl
I can't help but to dig her
A lil' jealous cause I know she got more than one nigga
The way I figure its cool if you're treatin' her right
You best be suckin' her, fuckin' her, and eatin' her right
You want the truth
I done bust shots for baby before
For niggas neglectin' and disrespectin' my ho
"Hell no! You lost your mind? Is y'all crazy?"
This is my bitch, I love her, and she havin' my babies
We been together since the top
When I was jockin' the corners
Was only 10 when I met my lil' friend California
Stumbled up one her when I was like ridin' my bike
Come to find out, Cali gets live at night
She hang wit Bay boys
And bangers called Crips and Bloods
She taught me how to hustle sellin' dimes and dubs
We made love on the daily
I was payin' her dues
Cali taught me the game
But Cali changed the rules
Confused, I never knew better
Used to sweat her for cheddar
She seduced me, and used me, from the day that I met her
She had me body guardin'
And I'm jump-startin', and I'm drive bying' and dischargin'
High speed chasin', false statements to the sergeant
I was so young and so dumb
The time, had no funds
But fuckin' wit young Cali
I got more dope and more guns
Put me on her turf and made me hustle for her trap money
Whispered in my ear "If you do good I'll give you rap money"
Sat me down one night so she can whip me wit some game
Gave me pen and pad, equipped me wit some slang
Told me that I'd write about the life that she had laid out
Keep her name alive
And make sure she never played out
Represent that place where we met on that Cali corner
Let the world know I got a thang for Mrs. California
