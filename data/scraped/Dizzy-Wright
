[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, it's taking a lot for me to give y'all all of me
For y'all to take it and run with it
And turn it into some shit that it's not

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, exceeded my expectations a while ago
They wondering why Dizzy the one that's always smiling for
I listen a lot and look at everything I done accomplished, mane
Still, my baby girl and son is the main thing that I value most
Family, fuck a xanny, I'm puffing on this flower though
You piece of shit, no thang, we keep it lit
No hard feelings, don't ever change, don't ever quit
When I found out living legends still exist, I knew I had to commit
So I heard that this new generation was waiting on me
After The Golden Age, these old heads been praying for me
To get involved, maybe vent to y'all, and make an impact
Better plant a seed and water that bitch and watch it grow
Now how many times I gotta say it? I been down and out
But you only get so many chances till you're fouling out
And I'm like, "Let me live without taking no breaths"
My mind is focused on which task I'm finna take on next, uh
I think back when I just hung with my dawgs
My mama could never keep a man cause we was running him off
Needed a father figure but I don't like how he coming across
He end up gone, she was sad but I felt like that's his loss
I told her, "Never bend your head, look the world straight in the eyes"
"You deserve love, but a queen don't need a king to survive"
And it's a blessing to be able to rap and not feed y'all lies
Or fake my happiness like everything's just fine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
Cause the loudest on the Internet get to sleep through a quiet night
It's a big difference and it's teaching me a lot about who we are, how like
Money don't change people, it just bring out who they truly are
Man, I done seen the most from coast to coast
They got us crossing over the border line
I don't got all the answers but we need to be more organized
So here's a little enlightening for your peace of mind
Everything you need in this life you live will come at the perfect time
So God bless America

[Hook: Chel'le]
In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just lack the trust (trust!)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Uh, follow me, follow me through the hardships
Pardon my need to be swift with how I start this speech
Who you more like? Malcolm or Martin?
The game that they play with us, brother, don't have no cartridge
Button mashers, disaster casters, they ass backwards
I might slave for a meal but you ain't my master
Running through the field, all I hear is laughter
Cause them chains that kept us here can no longer capture
The heart of my folk, foot on my the throat of my oppressor
For all of them ropes, they tied a tree for my ancestors
If limbs could talk, they'd cry for days
Sad, they gave all they had but couldn't break under pressure
Blood on the leaves, Glock on the dresser
Them laws plotting, protect and serve but I know better
The news a lie, to you and I, TV ain't real
So don't you try, to be like none of them Housewives
Selling us fools' gold
Tell a son to slang dope and daughter twerk when they get old
Damn shame, how we find time to sit around
Smoking and dranking, while they corporate banging
Don't be content with the hood, nigga, what is you thinking?
I got a small violin if you don't vote for complaining
About the government, stand up on some brother shit
And stop being on some other shit, God bless America

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Despite all the barriers
If you do whatever you do every day
You can get it
I did it

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
From the poorest, they said I gotta push for all my dreams and they flourished
Then a forest full of obstacles, I got the dope cause I'm morest
Don't ignore it, that I built this vocab without a thesaurus
When the war is pressing, they be asking me questions like Katie Couric
Like, "Did you sell dope when you fell broke?"
Tryna stop a male's hope who never dropped the jail soap
Made it up out of Hell's scope, they ask, can I spell "vote"?
I'm feeling like they tryna tell jokes, Chappelle wrote
I'm a U.S. citizen escaping the penitentiary they hid us in
The kid has been fitted to quit and then spit it and shit again
But I became noble and well-rounded like an oval
Never will I be grounded for disposal
Everybody be astounded by the mogul, Tech N9ne!
No more saying, "I can't afford this"
Even when I was down, my plan was to never abort this
Don't forget, they said I sold my soul, that's horse shit
Cause I simply thought my way onto the Forbes List
So God bless America

[Hook][Intro: Futuristic]
So I guess I'll smoke
So I guess I'll...
So I guess I'll smoke

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, this yo town, I'm only in it for the night though
I'm tryna feel right though
Slow down, what you think about a drink?
Mix it with a little bit of sprite though
Ain't you on tour with Dizzy Wright though?
Nigga roll something
You mean to tell me you around all these bomb ass trees
And you don't smoke nothing?
Fuck it, bad bitch wanna hit the blunt, don't mind if I do first
Cool verse, this some new work
Left the hotel, hit the show, God damn, it was too turnt
Crew shirt, that's WTF, yo bitch wanna wear that shit to bed
And then we got her smoking, I ain't joking
The way that she started blowing
It's only gon' make a nigga want some head
So I guess I'll smoke

[Hook: Futuristic]
So I guess I'll smoke, I guess I'll smoke
Smoke, so I guess I'll smoke
So I guess I'll smoke, smoke, smoke
So I guess I'll smoke, smoke, smoke

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt
After that, then another, chilling with my niggas and my brothers
Couple bitches say they with it
Probably gonna have them under covers
Yeah, they all smoke, hit up Cole, tell him that we need some more
Already got CÃ®roc and the honey jack, little bit of fireball
We picking up the papers at the store
I got it for the low, that's free shit
Fans wanna see me get the tree lit
Probably eat up all the sweet shit
Now I'm writing all this deep shit
Hit up AKT, damage every single beat quick
Straight THC, Now we mobbing in the car, that's a m-i-c
Step to the line and take hits like the MLB
Let the beat drop while I smoke this weed

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
We smoke a lot of weed dog, like a whole lot of weed
Back off tour like what, give it up for the new kid
Nigga I ain't tryna be the new Wiz
I'm just tryna do it like Snoop did
Too clever, whenever, however illegal
When I'm smoking pot up in the parking lot
Hit a lap around the world
Just to land in Amsterdam and smoke a blunt up in a coffee shop
Ain't you smoke like me, nigga
You don't want to see who get the highest, nigga, why you lying?
Nigga, you'll probably get the itis
I just got my marijuana license
She with me, she standing you up
They say I smoke, like I'm at the cannabis cup
Stand on your luck and get handed your face
On a platter with candles and stuff, away
Y'all niggas standing on the sideline
Double X-L fresh
Now I'm headed for the cover of the motherfucking High Times
Pregame before a headline, but it's bedtime for all of these kids
Off that wax, niggas know what it is
She hopped out that cab, just to hop on the dab
And I'm grabbing the torch and she grabbing my dick
Let us smoke

[Hook: Futuristic]

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
Puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, pass it to the side
Let your uncle get a drag of that
And puff, puff give, man, I need it for my cataracts
Old nigga, cold nigga, bold enough to hit the dab
And Yabba Dabba, Scooby Snacking
And little niggas doobie cracking
I'll be blowing til' the day that croak
I got nothing else to do, so I guess I'll smoke
Today and everyday after today I'll be
Smoking forever and that ain't no joke
I ain't even really mean to impede, y'all got all the bad bitches And all the best weed, catch these keys, she my speed
I'm 'bout to go get it, nigga, it's OG
All I had to say was, Buddah lover
Mo' Thug soldier and she came closer
Blew a couple shotguns, boy I keep a hot one
Bad to the bone, hit the bong and we got gone

[Outro: Layzie Bone]
Seeing so futuristic, weed got me dizzy, haha[Intro]
Yo, it's been 20 years since 1995
It's been 20 years since 1995
Since Pac dropped Me Against The World
It's been 20 years since 1995
E-40 did it In a Major Way, yamp
And Bone dropped E. 1999
It's been 20 years since 1995

[Verse 1]
Yo, I can tell they wasn't gon' be laughing at me later
Now the same niggas is asking me for favors
When i heard this beat I start feeling like Jigga man on "Imaginary Players"
Thinking to myself like, "these new niggas can't rap like this"
Four grams off the scale straight into my maintainer
If you ain't saying shit then fuck them headbangers and I'm screaming it out
Making music for you to lap dance
I wouldn't be surprised if my future killer's a black man
Wake up, walk out, another man chalked out
I feel like everyday i see the world a little different when it start out
CNN showing the wrong niggas going all out
Can't have a black event without black people having a fallout
Shout out to all my leaders that take on risks
Educated brothers against these niggas that make no sense
I see you wanna be uplift, dog, you can bank on this
Here to keep it real, not to play no tricks, ya punk bitch!

[Hook]
So just ride to it, can you vibe to it?
To see the good in everything you gotta train your mind
Don't let this motherfucking world waste your time
Holla at me if you change your mind, I want to world to just
Ride to it, we getting high to it
To see the good in everything, you gotta train your mind
You gotta train your mind, holla at me if you change your mind
I want the world to just

[Verse 2]
Concentrate, rolling something up with organic vibes
Blending in, walking through these streets like I'm camouflaged
I'm dealing with this third eye shit
I see who they wanna be with three eyes
I got two to look and one to see
Better watch out boy
I been had it now I'm right back to it
Got an old soul, with this stoner body attached to it
Happy that I'm alive, wake up with a smile on my face
Getting a back massage, baby already rolled up an eighth
Now I'm in this routine, she know what i like
Cherish the simplest things
But she don't wanna be in another situation-ship
Been so invested in being the best don't know what to make of it
But she see the good in my dreams and why I been chasing them
I had no love for them so why would I wait for them?
I see these kids in Vegas, I'm tryna be great for them
I'm talking the real life academy
No, I'm not here to brag about my salary
I'm here to try shape your mentality

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Focused on variety
I'm not the new 2Pac cause I'm here to do this quietly
But I'm here to shape society
Couldn't even envision what I'm tryna be
I'm next level with it
Thank you Funk Volume for signing me to come get it
Now i'm in it, spreading positivity and empowerment
Doing this way before Kendrick
Was rapping about lacking confidence
Feeling like all this new rap music just ruins it
So I'm here to let go of my outer inner-fluences, I'm cooling it
Giving all you niggas something real to follow
Even though the truth is a hard pill to swallow
It's still the motto
Painting these pictures like the real picasso
If you don't fit in today there's still tomorrow
Hoping it benefits us both
With these words tatted on me some gon' feel it and some won't
Nah, it ain't no hard feelings...

[Outro]
20 years since 1995[Intro: Hopsin]
All I hear is ladi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dada

[Hook: Hopsin]
Ain't gotta explain myself to no nigga, I don't have to change
Who the fuck I am, dawg, hell nah, that just ain't me
Don't worry 'bout the moves I make, we can really take it there if we have to
All I hear is ladi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dadi, dadi dada

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
They calling me the fly guy general, everything is memorable
Marijuana keep me at my pinnacle
Look, lucky me, I got two nougies that's identical
Me stayin' away from all the nicotine and chemicals
Look, I hit my west coast 1-2, cause lyrics do what guns do
Niggas doing what they want to, like this is what it's come to?
Come and witness lives you see me saving
DDT, you break your neck before I break my concentration
Mention the best, motherfuckers better come correct (right!)
Respected on the West, no doubt I'm here to finesse (right!)
Got problems? Hit me direct or get hit with the kill switch
And see, Dizzy go 0 to 100 real quick

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Look, Z to the third, I prefer to observe
Been on the sideline for a minute, now I'm 'bout to emerge
Separated myself from losers tryna take what I earn
Put my faith in this music knowing nothing's easy deserved, I got racks baby
You haven't noticed, I've been working on these tracks lately
Stacking this ammo just in case these niggas act crazy
I got my eyes wide open, putting this plan in motion, plotting how when I'm smoking
Forget about it, your vision's clouded and the truth is shrouded
And bullshit, so, all that gossip, we can do without it
I'm SwizZzleFish, who wants to skinny dip and take a swim?
The water's warm, I promise, darling, take that off and jump on in, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
I'm spitting the illest autobiography, could body your arteries
Name a motherfucker hard as me
I outta be mentioned with the Greek mythology gods
I beat and body the odds, his feet is by the garage
His head inside a duffel bag that's in back of my Dodge
Mr. Benton, ho, I refuse to be pigeonholed, with these imbeciles
A space ace that's been on, bitch, I been gone
I finger these hoes till I get carpal tunnel syndrome
I rap like I don't wanna go back in that basement
Cook up murder material, get blood on my apron
You don't want no problems, what the brass knuckle done
I'm a bully, I don't care to watch these fags guzzle cum
Gat with the bracket that the strap buckle on
Dr. Lecter in this bitch with that black muzzle on
Fuck the industry! Chip on my shoulder, bitch, remember me?
I'm 'bout to murder all my enemies, Hail Mary!

[Verse 4: Hopsin]
Sorry if I come off conceited
I'm dropping killer bars till you niggas all deleted
This lil' microphone, I'm known to eat it
The moment that I succeeded
It was hard to keep the bitches off my penis
Can you believe it?
I been perceived this, a motherfucking omen
Rap Trojan, Hulk Hogan, patrollin'
I ain't here to take no shit from no man
Got a problem with you, I'mma say it, bitch, you know it
I'm Conan, I stroll in
Looking like a monster when I go in
Standing up against me, you got no chance
Tryna play the game without a token, you niggas gotta be joking
This is the reason my niggas the dopest, we on it

[Hook][Intro]
You get what you get, nigga
Ay freeze, bring me that lighter bro
Go ahead and light something up
Vibe with me

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Never letting this entertainment business drive me (drive me)
Never will I let being famous make me cocky (making me cocky)
So I watch out for these bitches
Cause it'll take them thirty years for them
To try to tarnish your name like Bill Cosby
No paparazzi all in front of my steps
Sometimes, we brothers, we just do that shit to ourselves
We learn from it with a little help in a major way
I'm just hoping we don't fuck around
And make the same mistakes (okay)
But look I'm back here in the same spot that I left in (that I left in)
You don't know me, cool
I'm making my very best first impression
Been blessed to  send yall a message
For every time you get into the mood
I'm here for the grown folks to youth
Your family and boo and you
I'm talking everybody
You can accept it at your own pace
But we can't keep screaming racism
If we killing our own race
Not only are we against them
We against us
We been fucked up
Cause this rap life is a fucking false reality

[Hook]
If I could make a living keeping it real with y'all
Keeping it real with y'all, keeping it real with y'all
Then I could go to the grave knowing I did my job
Did my job by not promoting a false reality
Touching the world, got to make this music live forever man
Live forever man, live forever man
Never let someone make you feel you don't feel deserve everything
These false realities ain't everything ([?] know I'm right)

[Verse 2]
She was dying on the outside
Baby was growing  on the inside
Bringing a new life into this life
How did it get this way?
Dealing with these petty thugs
That rather hit every club
Instead of giving they baby mama belly rubs
Childish things
Lie about a lot of these things
Like trying to get close to bad bitches
Not knowing we putting down our queens
We don't even notice all this drama we cause
Look, if you don't know nothing about how to love, brother
You don't know nothing at all
Thinking like what if fifty years ago
They had what we got?
These cell phones or the Internet
Would have been divided by color
You all can't even prepare us for this shit we dealing with now
So the newer niggas gotta be able to help their younger brothers
And love each other
Cause the people still talking
The soul of Doctor King is still marching
We dealing with these everyday tragedies
Kids wrapped up in the rap life
That's false reality

(No I don't got to bring up race to know this country was build off it, I'm just saying)

[Hook][Produced by King Vay]

[Intro]
Higher learning, higher learning, higher learning

[Verse]
I heard they praised me for being real, but I donât see the support
Fell in love with changing lives and chose that over a sport
Couldâve been anything in life and yet Iâm out here on tour
Like some day we gonna get bored and we gon' want more
Pretty much prepping myself
For the fans that finna get ahead of they self
When they act like they know everything about me
And all the niggas that doubt me
Come outta nowhere and start criticizing all proudly
Like âhold on nigga, where the fuck was yaâll at?â
Buggin out on me, nigga fuckin' now, homie
Some days I can feel Hopsinâs energy rubbinâ off on me
Cause the love donât feel real if the talent is only a skill
Itâs unrealistic to think that one day we wonât make a mistake
But who am I to say, itâs probably from never taking a break
Finding pleasure in poetry, guitar strings and a bass
Uh, my life ainât been the same while on the run
When these kids say âfuck a message, we just wanna have funâ
Now I move to the beat that confused me for weeks
While yaâll hands high, my head high like hold on nigga you lost me
Then I looked at my Youtube views, and I got salty
Cause I realised my real shit donât get that much love
I see exactly how yaâll do yaâll favourite rappers
Favorite musicians, athletes, actress, actors
Spreading anything without it being the truth
I guess to tarnish someones image these days is the thing to do
But when you stop judging the music
And you decide you wanna judge me on the way I live my life
Cause Iâm a celebrity and you can
Donât be surprised if my response to the negative shit
Is telling you to âsuck my dickâ
Iâm a grown ass man
Grew up strong enough to deal with all these so called fans
My momma say I got thick skin
My daddy say theyâll never really understand our struggle as kids
Until the end, build off small wins, now here I am

[Outro]

Album Cover:




....Yo
Coming from the west put the V in front of the L
I couldn't tell that they wanted to see me fail
Went from XXLs to being on XXL
So when they try to clown, they making fun of themselves
This is pro-gression, work ethic, with a cold message
Dedication, annihilating your whole section
Dizzy Wright, I'm Heaven-sent with the Old Testament
Mixing my music with my spiritual connection
Damn, how he do it? 22 when he moving
I heard it was my moment, I'm just here to fucking prove it
I'm about to lose it, had to 1992 it
Flat top with a passion for lyrics over producing
Obligated, and can you believe he out of Vegas?
And he fly, probably change the appearance of the population
Yeah, this my Inauguration, yeah, I got 'em all debating
I ain't tripping, I'mma just go harder for my daughter
Bottom line is niggas like me is hard to find
Top 10 freshmen, I better be in the starting 5
Like for the weed for me, I sparking mine
Cause we done did the shit
And now all my fans get to witness it
Get money and we flipping it
You ain't a nigga with an attitude
Nigga you just ignorant
Hang yourself if you ain't feeling this
Cause we dreamed it and believed it
Now I'm positive thinking
Dizzy Wright[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Just got an expensive pack (Yeahh)
Black Locs with the golden rims to match (Yeahh)
Nice style, yeah the Fresh Prince is back (yeahh)
2 wings and a crown is how I mix and match
I hits the wax, cloud surfin' on a cloud pen
Positive energy when you stands around him (yeahh)
Popular can't stand to see them niggas down him
Just a couple brown men tryna get some clean money (yeahh)
Oh this is life well it's alright I got this hotel for the night
But for the flight I be up all through the night
What it's like? it's cool
I be doing what I do for you
I'm in the street's 'til my feet hurt
Ayo Dizzy I got it if you ever need work
I'm goodie I got some shit that I've been working on (oh snap)
Heard it all but I feel I deserve it all (I feel ya)
I ain't trying to get all caught up in the life
Caught up in some shit that got me paying for lawyers for battles they don't wanna fight right
Keep it Dizzy right? Roll it up and lit the hippy life
Even on yo' shitty night (at least he got some weed)
Yeah maintaining 'til I'm stable and comfy
Middle fangaz to the labels that want me
I'm funky if you smell me tell me, we living good in the LV

[Hook: ]
I'm more then alright
Got a good vibe, everyday I'm celebrating life
Living fly got 2 Wings and a crown
(Living like a king now)
Nothing but love, got a good buzz
Want to give the whole wide world a hug
Living high like 2 wings and a crown

[Verse 2: Irv Da Phenom]
All I ever wanted to do
Was make the music people bob they head to
And get to moving they shoes
It's coming from the soul but I'm never singing the blues
Cause God is just too good to stop smiling
Used a lot of time of mine searching for the diamonds
'Til the day I looked up in the mirror and seen the brightest one shinin'
I got a welter millionaires I've never seen
You not on top of the world if you still in need of self-esteem
We hard looking for that feeling
The only place that you will ever get it
It's in that vessel you live in
You got approval before you even ask permission
Just decide that its finally time for you to get it
We kick it harder for the homies who got wings now
Life is short so I'm living like a king now
I'm on a high they can never ever bring down
On cloud 9 creating mean sounds.. ha

[Hook: ]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
(Break it down)
2 wings and a crown from holding it down
King Dizzy get them girls aroused when I'm around
Peep the visuals and I'm a keep this literal like trout
It's the physical so if you ain't capable then you wack
Remember them days in Vegas we taped it all in the house
No worries we had no vision to make it or make it out
This rap shit was just a fantasy
I had no energy for enemies that's sympathy for family
Stone cold
If I'm lying where's my long nose
10 year old soul rapping with some corn rows
Ya'll don't know the past
I got that spoken word flow and I'm a show yo ass
Steppin' on my toes and I'm a slap you with some shoulder pads
If you ain't moving with the music you should fall back
I'm moving with the Buddha and the bra strap
Gifted because I found out my talents even existed by staying consistent
When niggas told me I wasn't all that

[Hook: ][Verse 1]
She said, "Can you accept that I am ready for my death?"
Got a baby boy and I ain't got no help
His father up in jail
And while he sittin' in his cell praying for us
I'm just sitting my by self
Nigga left me alone
Had to provide a home
Young women taking care of my baby
All on my own
Going to school
Can you imagine being raped by the only father figure
That you ever fuckin' knew
So hell yeah I'm bitter
And I probably won't fuck with you
I'm fucked up and I got trust issues
My ex boyfriend beat me
Repeatedly, I'm free at last
I was immune to being treated bad
He took my soul
Made me want to give up
And now I'm in this nasty ass strip club
Trying to get a dolla
So you can really judge when you holla
But the devil makes it hardah
So I got one question

[Hook]
Can you accept my flaws? [x10]

[Verse 2]
He said, "I dropped out of school for the street life"
Shit, I just wanted to be a daddy
I started slangin' this weed to get this money
Just so I could make my baby momma happy
Easy money
Fuck it, it's keeping me stable
Keeping the bills paid
And keeping food on the table
See I'm fucked up in the head
And you would be too
If you watched yo momma open her legs
Just to get ya'll some bread
Baby girl I am dead to the world
I don't wanna be here
I see clear, and this shit I see
Is what we fed
I bleed tears
I'm different, I watch the women downgrade herself for a livin'
So I'm picky when I'm picking for the women that I'm feelin'
Me and my brother were abandoned children
Sex was appealing
I had to be all or not
And by 13, I wanted sex, all the time
Sad right
I just felt like I was caged with this info
So can you accept that I was raised as a nimpho
Trying to better myself from all this shit that I been through
So it's not about sex
But that's the shit that I'm in to
Yea, so can you accept my flaws
Overlook my bads and try to knock down these walls
That I built when I was lonely
Trying to shray away from all
Or would you just tell me that it's too hard

[Hook]
Can you accept my flaws? [x10]
Accept me for who I am
Accept me
No no, don't judge me on what I am?
Accept me[Verse 1]
She said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
You about to grab your full clip so you can go retaliate
You wanna know why I'm trippin?
Cause I don't wanna have to birth this baby on my own and have to explain why you passed away
You say, you good, like you may be home
But in my heart I know you may be wrong
I wish you understood I wouldn't agreed to a baby if you was gonna be beefing with other hoods, you trynna play me out
A negative is how you make me out but if something happened to you which one of your homies gonna help me raise this child?
We was in this together, be a man
And if they killed yo friend I know damn well they'll kill again
So don't you look at me stupid like everything's alright, it's not alright your stupidity can cost you your life
And now I'm stuck with your child, understand me
You worried about your goons and I'm worried about this family

[Hook:Chel'le]
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

[Verse 2]
He said
I guess I gotta just deal with the bullshit
The fact that they used a full clip to kill my fucking best friend
So why you talkin about family? I considered him family, so don't mistake this for a muthafucking Def Jam
I'm trynna tell you I'm good, but if they take me home
I pray to God that you keep my baby strong
I may be wrong trynna handle with altercation
But how can I live my life if I ran from this situation?
So I take a little vacation after my nigga got blasted
I was riding when he was riding
Now I'm supposed to be scared of a casket you ain't feelin' that?
I ain't no killa but I'm killing back
I don't give a fuck!
I'mma retaliate like I can bring my nigga back
It's war, it's not my kindness it's insanity
Take a friend of mine and now everybody's an enemy
Fuck it I gotta do it, don't lose it I know you hate this shit
But I'll be damned if they get away with this. It's on

[Hook:Chel'le]
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)

[Bridge]
Had ya pride not got in the way, I would have known just what I meant to you
Had my pride not got in the way, you would have known, just what you mean to me

[Hook:Chel'le]
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)
Can you accept my flaws? (When it all comes falling down)[Hook]
Ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
I ain't worried bout nothin'
Skee ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
DJ Skee ain't worried bout nothin'

[Problem]
Go there with that work, went out for them people
And them ho niggas looking thirsty, please get them Aquafina
Money gone faster than cheetahs, old hoes miss this king like Cleveland
I ride through the hood, sucka niggas be hatin'
Say they sure gon' get at me, I been anxiously waitin'
Sippin' Pina Coladas, smoking flower with asians
Bitches, can't worry bout nothin'
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
Nigga wanna fight, we can trunk em
Reebok pump lumps in the young punk, ya feel?

[Hook]

[Crooked I]
I'm in the strip club, Secret Sunday, nigga got a 50 Band necklace on
I'm by myself, I'm turnin' up, haters out here better respect the throne
It's C.O.B. until they bury a nigga, Sut two times, what up my COB
This street money, I ain't worried nigga, I don't work, but see I love my job (Nigga work)
See me rollin' up the block, while I'm throwin' up a knot, and I'm going to the spot
Bad shorty on my jock, bad shorty on my jock
Open up her box on the Coconut Ciroc
This Eastside, L.B. City boy, rock 2 chains like Tity Boi
Crooked I live like a model with ass, that mean a nigga sit pretty boy

[Hook]

[Dizzy Wright]
East side, Las Vegas, young player comin' out of nowhere
Now I'm rappin' with the Big Seans, you like Woah Dere
Lil nigga, don't go there, so rare
I'm prepared for the lifestyle
Spit it how I live it when the mic's out
Got a housewife in a nightgown
Before rap, the one L, but let me put the pipe down
Comin' from the city of the Fight Night
Bringin' entertainment to the limelight
All the city really needed was an artist
And guess who the hottest, I guess I got the green light
Skee life, what it be like
Dizzy Wright be like what the tree like?
Kushed out in the function
Can't kill my vibe, fuck nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'

[Hook]

[Game]
Got a million on my neck, lil fuck nigga, I ain't worried bout much
Y'all worried bout us, 16 out the clip till his watermelon bust
Got a bitch ridin' shotgun, with a .45 and a Louis Vuitton clutch
Where I been in the cut? Now I'm back, it's a rap, whole world on my nuts
And your girl on my nuts, consequences when these niggas be cuffin'
I'mma hit her raw, them I'm pulling out, nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin'
I ain't worried bout nothin', red styrofoam cup, sippin' on that gas
I can slow it down like French, or I can go Twista on that ass
My nigga turn it up, never turn down, while I'm sippin' the Don
My niggas gettin' it on, we got yo bitch in a thong
Flippin' her dome, one sip and she gone
We turn it on, give her the long bone, and then she go home
Make a nigga pull a grip out the cut, call a bitch I could fuck
Have her howlin' at the moonlight, AK 47 in your bitch
Put the pussy on Instagram, show you what the goon like
These LA hoes don't like me cause I fucked em all
I wear Louis, I wear Gucci, nigga fuck the mall
Niggas kill the club, so they kill fraud
I'm bout to kill me a nigga, and beat the charge

[Hook]

[French Montana]
Ridin' round with that work, strapped up with that Nina
Got two bad bitches with me, Molly and Aquafina
Money don't mean nothing, niggas don't feel you when they see you
My whole 'hood love me, but now a nigga wanna touch me

[Hook][Intro]
Niggas talk that "real" shit
I don't even know what's real no more
These mothafuckas nowadays
Just be saying shit
A lot of shit going on in the world
And these niggas talkin about they real niggas

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Uh I never been the type to judge niggas
Fuck, niggas look at me like I lucked up nigga
But this shit is getting harder
Got a stomach full of liquor and I'm thinking about my daughter
I should be a-fucking-shamed of myself
Baby mama struggling, I put the fucking blame on myself
I should just grab my gat, and fucking aim at myself
I did this on my own, you niggas came with the help
So I disinclude and no I'm not dissing you
But in the interview, I clearly said I don't remember you, lil nigga
You ain't nothing but a lil nigga
Just me and my .45, it quite clear that you came full of niggas
Uh, I know that bullshit gangsta talk
But I don't ever get involved if I ain't involved
What you portraying dawg, blowing money
Fuck that, I'm trying to teach my child how to save it all

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
So if I vent to you, tell me can you see yourself making assumptions (making assumptions)?
Contradicting my shit from the outside, making a judgement (making a judgement) x2

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I guess I'm just like everybody else, living in this world with no help
No guidance, no self-love, until I met drugs
Gangstas being imitated, by internet thugs, Shrugs
No hugs, just guns, just fun
He bust one, retaliate on my loved one
It ain't worth it, need a 9 to 5
It ain't working, not for me
So I'm doing it for a strange purpose
I ain't too focused on the "getting around,"
The pussy will come, I just can't be sitting around
Looking around, missed it when it could've been now
As good as they come, and got lost in the crowd
That's a sad story
See niggas just wanna hustle and rap
Rap music got bitch niggas in love with the trap
Me, I got that shit to make the government mad
Pussy nigga, how thuggin is that?
Take notes..

[Hook][Intro: Euroz]
They wanna see you doing good
Just not better than them
Imagine that

[Verse 1: Euroz]
Huh
You can find me at the top
This where luck can't take ya
I'd done ran out of fuck [and favors]
The expression that my haters make they just can't take it
To see a nigga come up and rise above fan favorites
Thoughts that be residing in my head
Does she fuck with me for me, or she just tryna get ahead
These days meeting contracts and [?]
Searching for partnership if not I'm signing me instead
I let go and let God, I don't ever stress
I smoke kush, never stress
Give you line on top of line, that's the letter X
I went to jail and found rap and for that I'm forever blessed
Sleep that's for broke niggas I don't ever rest
Promises I've made but I've never kept
If they ain't real we ain't around such
Blood, sweat, and tears, built it from the ground up

[Hook]
Huh
Praise going up
God's blessings just fall on me
It's me against the world
No matter the odds bet it all on me
I'm just trying to live
No time to waste so I start homie
Back then they didn't know me
Now I'm hot they all on me
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot they all on me
All on me, all on me, all on me

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Las Vegas legend (he a legend)
Seven years been on this shit since '07 ('07)
Did it first so which nigga gon' do it second (it don't matter)
Kill em' with kindness be signing without a weapon (peace signs)
But they don't like that so they compete to feel complete (riight)
Funny, now everybody compare themself to me (riight)
Playing for keeps accomplished all this shit by 23
Amazing
The Golden Age got me where I wanna be (wanna be)
Now the world anticipating on me to lead
My response is who got me
Niggas wanna be put on while sloppy and then they knock me (right)
My daughter's three years and before she learn how to potty
I learned and realized that this rap shit is not for everybody (real shit)
So I'm keeping my shit solid
They lying about catching bodies you niggas wouldn't even cock (keep it real)
Stayin' polished, corny niggas get demolished
Spit knowledge and don't even get acknowledged
But it's cool

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Euroz]
Huh
A stand up nigga, ovation shit
A different chick in every city that's location shifts
It's not the situation, more like what you make of it
The chick you layin' next to or the cat you splittin' franklins with
The same story, just different pages
And I don't drive much I get driven places
This nostalgic, Rebecca [?] basement
Classic shit we be longing is what I've been busy making
Make way for a new legend
I feel it's that time
Cash ain't coming like it used to so I tend to stack mine
Hip hop on its death bed its finna flatline
The major labels is dyin' let us indie cats shine
They don't care about the art
They putting on for the bitches
Blow the advance, they know hoes long for the riches
I'm like a nigga who don't understand patience
I had to ask myself what's wrong with this picture

[Hook][Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Damn, what has the world come to
I swear that we used to be slaves
And Martin Luther King had a dream
And I bet that he turnin' over in his grave
Look at how we behave, my black people
We dont even act equal, we act evil
Why, because its easy and we see diamonds and then our favorite rappers go off and preach violence, for weak minded
Because we follow that shit
We went from leaders, to be followin' shit
So we bottle it in like we dont see it
When we know we believe it
So im hear to make you change for a reason, my black people

[Hook]
Uhh, I'm just a kid from Las Vegas
And I ain't trynna come up like I'm racist
And lately, I've been feelin like we act evil
So I had to do this for my black people
Time to make a change
Sayin' it loud, I'm black and I'm proud [x3]
And im about to make a change starting now

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I look at the generation under us
And I wonder how they gone do it
Our great grandparents fought for our rights
Now we got them and we sit up and abuse em
Its time to make a change, but I ain't god
Yall ain't gonna listen
Yall just gonna sit up and nod
And tell me that im hot and say I need a deal
If it come, then it come, but im talking about whats real
It takes one day
It takes one smile
Put your fist up, put the gun down
Nigga be a man
Dont do what you can for nothing
Cause if your gonna stand better stand for somethin'
Black people wanna know why they winning
Wanna know why we looked at so different
Cause we allow these little black children to raised by a fucking television
Are you kidding me dog
You teaching kids how to be fresh, but you forget to teach them how to have some respect
So they walk around without it
Never whats up
We need to teach these kids to be better than us
But we dont, so why bother
If we won't, than why offer
Life's crazy but it gets a little harder
We like being flashy
But we love being fathers my black people

[Hook]

Uhh, Im just a kid from Las Vegas
And I ain't trynna come up like I'm racist
And lately ive been feelin like we act evil
So I had to do this for my black people
Time to make a change
Sayin' it loud im black and im proud [3x]
And im about to make a change starting now
And we go'n do it like this
Put your fist in the air if you feel this [x3]
This is a public announcement
Put your fist in the air if you feel this [x3]
This is a public announcement

Uhh, Im just a kid from Las Vegas
And I ain't trynna come up like I'm racist
And lately ive been feelin like we act evil
So I had to do this for my black people
Time to make a change
Sayin' it loud im black and im proud x3
And im 'bout to start making a change starting now

[Outro]
I do this for the kids
I do this for the community, musically I'm trying to bring back that unity
U.N.I.T.Y
Yeah, for my black people and I'mma make a change startin' now[Hook]
Yeaaah, (Remix!) all you motherfuckers
Turn it up let it (bounce)
In the trunk let it (bounce)
Throw em up let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch, this is what we do when we verbally turn em out
With the speakers to the maximum, baby just let it bounce
Now, in a crowd let it, (bounce) turn it loud let it (bounce)
Blow em out let it (bounce)
Yeah bitch, this is what we do when I show em what I'm about
With the speakers to the maximum baby just let it bounce

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Get your speakers turned up! time to hit them with the remix
Here to make them bounce like a pair of DD tits!
Jordans on my feet bitch I'm flyer then a G-6
G-man with me like I'm rolling with Hakeem Nicks
Got a quarter pound, think I'm bout to order fries
Big-Bam-Boo, Ain't a day that I ain't sorta high!
And I'm'a kill a beat until I'm 45, spitting flames til I leave the mic cauterized
Who am I? They know me as C - W, hole in my rubber you are about to see me coming through!
Chris Rios always running with a pun or two, ask the Birdman, I'm the number one stunna' dude!
Bigger then a fucking typhoon
They can't ignore me after they see me on Itunes, top of the charts the numbers don't lie dude!
So bump this every time you ride through!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Remix, re-gifts, busy over this way
West coast, throw it up, even if you bitch made
Bounce like your chick that left you for a chick
Cause you couldn't cut it, she fell fast in love with touching clit
Aw shit! what a transition
Your shows whack, fuck paying for the admission!
I'd rather kick it at the house, scooped up on the couch
Pay per view on demand, big blunt in my mouth
Plus a couple egg rolls in the toaster oven
Homie I'm trying to function, I'm on my base shit, going ape shit! Bonkers!
So turns this up to the max like TJ
Where I window shop and buy socks at cheap rates
What the fuck is really good? tell me how you really feel
Shit we bouncing like a fat kid in the jungle off a hill
Come on nigga be for real, quit acting like a ho!
It's SwizZzle Webby and Dizzy at your mother fucking door

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
You hear the bass bumping through the speakers
Poetry alive, this the sound of a preacher
Snatch sneakers, get paid to rip features
You don't like me? well me don't like me either
Used to be debbie, now I'm Wiz Khalifa
They gon' judge me how they see my appearance
But yall ain't hearing me though
I'm killing alot but got a million to go
They say I'm hot cause I get appealed to the most
You should feel like a joke, take notes and do it proudly
We rodwy pull up to the show, the car cloudy
Get on the stage and blame it on the Maui Wowie
Typical instrumental killer giving visuals, I'm no teacher
I'm creeping on the come up on a sleeper
Make you feel weaker just to think a little deeper
Went from writing raps on the bleacher
To making nigga's bounce in the arenas
Webby what we tell em'

[Hook][Produced by: 6ix]


[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Hit a nigga with a raw dog flow y'all
All 4 Down Nigga Bang Bang
East Side, West Side, North Town
Hold it down for my niggas trying to maintain
Coming from the bottom trying to make it out
He don't need help, he don't need a vouch
City of the sand, with a pin that bleed, is there a reason you believe me now?
I see a little nigga puttin' on, you've been warned
I could of sworn, I was born with a hoodie on
All black with an axe I ain't stopping 'til that little nigga put me on
Drop albums hot freestyles
So let me hit them with a little bit of Flipmode
Bust your head then bust your rhymes
You better cut the check or cut the line

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Coast to coast spending the most time on the road
You ain't 'bout that life
Independent living missing my fam in order to grow
You ain't bout that life
Becoming the coldest nigga out of every nigga that I know
You ain't 'bout that life
And I made my fans my foe's shaking hands romancing hoes
Let em' know x2

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Let's spark it up with that heart to heart
If we could talk it off and we would
Cause we gon' smoke it up and she gon' roll it up and she gon' show a nigga some love
All my buddies starting to get on drugs, I got high just to get on up
I left that just to get on track and now look who I get on tracks, you niggas ain't getting us
Fruit don't fall far from the tree though, we traveling city city
Which don't matter we had them that pretty kitty
On my platter that master of me and my spirit don't matter
I'm a mad man and I'm a medicate, elevate just to separate
You couldn't handle the highest, I'm rambling by
Scramble my egg's as I wake and bake, trying to be better than Hov
As good as Tech N9ne at every show, I'm losing my mind,
Let me define
Dizzy dizzy never better before
Hippy nigga drunk and trippy ain't tripping off niggas, I'm 50-50 with the bone
Busy nigga listen to Bizzy Bone, little Dizzy had to do it his own
What you mean fake niggas gonna come in clean, aye ho you wanna suck a King?
(Right)
Make a movie just to make the league
You ain't 'bout that life you ain't tryna taste the dreams huh? (not at all)
Tellin' the realest nigga that you feelin' it
Takin' my knee to his face and I'm drillin' it
'Til somebody admit that I been the illest in the buildin'

[Hook: Dizzy Wright] x2

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Dizzy Wright man these niggas betta lay low
FV is the label, no they can't roll
Put your hands out reachin for the payroll
That'll get your face swole, bitch you ain't know?
Motherfuckers say I'm too hostile, I hit a nigga with a boom bop bow
Y'all thinking that I'm 2Pac child, you did it real big back in the day
You was the shit but nigga you not now, The Dark Vader of rap
Been grindin for years, now my paper is stacked (yup)
Haters is mad, they hang from my sack
Well I'm celebrating with some skaters that thrash
Fans sayin lately I'm spitting weak
Fuck you yo I been a beast, give me the mic yo I'm finna eat
MC's getting weak
When I be up in the booth cause I'm shitting heat, nigga literately
Motherfucker what you want now
Can't stop and I won't stop
I'll put a nigga in a dome lock
'Til he pass out, then throw him in the shed with the door lock
Bitch I'm on top
Rage and venom, was raised a villain
And it's gonna take a motherfucker 30 days to get him
Back on track, these niggas can't wait to kill him
Man take a look at how his own label did him
It's okay though, see I made dough
Yeah nigga I get it
I'm stacking pesos like they legos
That life I live it
If I had a fuck I wouldn't give it
You couldn't paint a picture more vivid
I'll turn a hard rapper into timid
They call a nigga Hop like its never gonna stop
FV til it's not my business

[Hook: Dizzy Wright] x2[Hook: Dizzy Wright](2X)
Tell em the youth need it
Oh they want the truth
Iâm here for two reasons
Whatâs that?
Money and respect
Whatâs that, whatâs that?
Money and respect

[Verse 1: Big Remo]
If you back to charginâ niggas a leg and an arm
Motherfuckers got the right to bear arms
And, so I cherish it, rightfully ainât soft
When it comes to a nigga, Iâm lyrically O-Dog
Doughboy, thereâs too many Rickyâs
In this little city, so Iâm just out to get it
And any years I feel intimidation this situation gets shaky
Itâs too many sketchy, any affiliated out to get me bitches
When I donât answer texts, they swear Iâm sleepin with the next
My father told me play chess piece or they let me breathe
Better swear they evils and Caesar's, they should let me be
But they heathens, they ainât eaten
I dine with royalty, they see it
Scopin my baked ziti
You openly have a nerve, to joke like I ainât peep it
But thatâs a life of American [?]
Met a stranger, and he said keep preachinâ cause the youth need it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
They need a love, indeed believe it will come
Slam my fingers, stomp my feet, to the beat of this drum
Been stressinâ all weak, dropped the ball, but itâs all G
Play the bass, letâs create, this the sound of my heart beat
Uh, 23, and Iâm rockinâ this box cutter
My girlfriend is knocked up
But this a blessinâ that we should keep
With no doubts, this funky shit finna sprout
Iâm bout to regulate the game, I got a vouch from Warren G
(West Side)
Las Vegas ainât never seen another me
Itâs only me remaining humble, but the outcome is never cheap
Top of the charts, and Iâm trying to last for some weeks
She grabbed my hand, and I put it on the back of her cheeks
I go along, squeeze it, look at me holding on
Stare me down, I almost drowned
I shouldâve had my floaties on
Shoulda gave me a warning
New girl, you know you wrong
Obviously, you bringing that shit out of me
Player shit, investigate before you try to board this player ship
Cause you might be taking a later trip
Cause we donât fuck around with the fuck arounds
24/7 hustlers is niggas that I hung around

[Hook](2X)[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Ayo
Props to all of my folks that's holding me down
I battle with realization that I'm on the stage when I was in the crowd
I'm living for now, was putting it down
Remember them two little niggas from running around your town
Who nigga? Capo and Dizzy?! Nigga, what?!
Killing all opponents, nigga now she on it
Hit it to can I hit it in the morning
See that's where I fucked up, cause now
She hitting up all of my homies, like have y'all seen this nigga?
Daily dilemmas that a nigga deal with
From the girl that I chose to chill with
Ain't responding to no texts for her
I'm finna hit that next on her
Superman and flex on her
But I don't wanna take it there
Trying to make it fair, so I bear the pain
Judging me seperate cess, so I guess that's a fair change
She keep coming at me like this my nigga
Don't wanna break up, but I needed a break from the ho
And she ain't a ho, but I'm mad, so nigga right now she a ho
Every time she get insecure, she want me to be immature
How she be acting while I'm on tour
Like what's mine ain't yours

[Hook]
But still my girl sending bad vibes to my phone
And I ain't picking up cause she don't wanna lower her tone
And every time she think a nigga be wrong, she be on
And I feed into that zone, but tonight we blowing on strong
Leave me alone, I'm with my brodee bro's (x4)

[Verse 2: Capo]
She wanna be my baby, wanna scoop me up
On Pro Tools in my studio, she wanna loop me up
Baby slow your role, now roll this weed
And yeah I got time, but I don't got time when I'm with my G's
Is that hard to believe?
Me and Young Wright, you know we killing these niggas
I don't gotta say we ain't feeling these niggas
You say you can't deal with my G, then girl
I guess you gon' have to go deal with these niggas
I can't stress it, and girl you can't check it
Cause either you down, or you just around like a necklace
You be calling me, texting me
You don't know you like an ex to me
God made you beautiful, but what this world do to you
Your insecurities not securing me, I'm feeling like
I'd rather be alone if this the way it gotta be at night
Just me and my brodees, cause girl you got me twisted
You be flippin', I'mma need some distance just to be specific
Call my nigga Dizz, like these ho's be trippin'
I got three rolled
So tell me where we smoking these extensions

[Hook][Verse 1]
Ms. Big-Booty-With-The-Spandex
Yes, what it do, where your man at?
I'm trynna converse
Most likely to be the first
Nigga to spit this much game til you threw a verse
Beside E-40
We both know
They won't know
What they can't see
Cause they can't go
It's just me and you
We them niggas with clean money
I need a freaky bitch to keep the pussy clean for me
Old enough to make her own decisions
If you're living on your own, well, take a nigga home
I'm only getting ratchet with a bitch
She threw her pussy at my face so I slapped her with the dick
Rapping while she's doing little tongue action tricks
I'm just having fun, running with the shit
If she want the dick, nasty bitch that don't like to spit
I might let her taste the flavors
But first I need a favor

[Hook]
Ladies scream if you gon' let a nigga hit
Take a dip and hit the pussy real quick
Bounce them titties for a nigga
If you came to the club just to show love (then what?)
Then bounce them titties for a nigga
If your bad behavior got you shaking what your mama gave ya (then what?)
Then bounce them titties for a nigga
If your nigga ain't shit and that nigga acting bitch-made (then what?)
Then bounce them titties for a nigga
I ain't shit but my shit probably help you get your rent paid
Bounce them titties for a nigga
Bounce them titties for a nigga

[Verse 2]
Hide your wives, trying to get inside them thighs
High forever, yeah we're getting high tonight
Roll with me, young nigga roaming the streets
Baby I could have you moaning for weeks
I swear I'm feeling like the man, dog
Booty big, I couldn't keep my hands off
Baby make it jiggle with your pants off
Cause playing with my balls ain't enough no more
Tonight you better get that pussy up for show
Hoes be scheming, late night creep and they get a piece
Of the beast
Under the sheets
That's under my briefs
I know they feeling thick when they be bouncing on it
Probably hit the pussy, wasn't counting on it
8:35, gotta hit the stage by 9
Make my day
Take it out and take your time
It's alright
If you trying to kick cause you tripping it
In order to leave how we know you with the business

[Hook][Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Look, I know I made some mistakes
But baby I can't take it away
I'm tryna make it okay, used to kick it late in the day
Now you, thinking a way to find a place in my day
It takes time for this kinda shit to work
Especially when being used and being hurt
Is the moral of the story, you can be for me
By making us strong, dealing our own
While I'm singing this song

[Chorus: Chel'le]
I'm building this life for you
I just wanna see you smile
Don't care bout what you can do
We living life in the now
I'm building this life for you

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Uhh
With a little bit of effort, we can make love look cool
Become one, see no evil, learn about me and I could learn about you
See it ain't no pressure, honesty is all I ask
And I'ma take care of all that ass
Caressing my fresh fade, massages after stressed days
Beautiful and it ain't even yo best day
I'm loving the chemistry, demonstrating my weakness
You a queen and I'm in need of the treatment
You stuck on defense
But I guess that's a good thing
But I'm just not here for the good things
I wanna love you with all your flaws, your ex was a dog
So he made you feel like you couldn't be you
But I'ma, give you my all, applaud when you stand tall
And make every girl in the world wanna be you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Uhh
Every nigga has issues
To leave me would be as dumb as it gets
And if, what we got is really something you into
You should be willing to put in a hundred percent
I told, lies, avoid cries
Man looking out a boys eyes, tryna make the right moves
Stimulating by wrong, bitches turning me on
But I never met a pretty woman like you
Living life in the now, nice with a smile
Trips on the plane spending long nights in the clouds
We only live once, ain't no price on this side
So we shop till we drop then we out
We calling in bonding
They calling it caking, they hatin'
That's why they single and waitin'
I remain patient, gave something you can believe
You plus me is all I need
C'mon!

[Chorus][Verse 1: ]
Hopping off my plane, finna grab my bag
Running on my main, 'bout to jump in the cab
She always be late, and she saying she trying to drive fast
She better not crash
Over here waiting on you sitting out of commission
She said chill out my nigga just kick it
Cause lord knows I don't need another ticket
Well I traveled the distance
Now I'm back home back in business
So I'm kinda impatient
So I'm a hit the weed man and make arrangements
I'm just tired of the waiting so my attitude is changing
She like stop the complaining
I swear I'm not leaving you hanging
We gon' pick up the trees, just sit in yo' seat
Okay, now you talking my language
I've been on tour for so long, adapted habits
Back home, now it's back to dabbing
Sorry if you see me act dramatic
She told me relax the madness
How you acting?
She like fuck it you've been on the road
A nigga in one of them modes
His motions is being exposed
But fuck it, in 24 hours I'm gone
Well I'm trying to be yours when you ain't right
Changed flights through the lay-overs
Came back and its all good
Cause you look good well you might as well stay old
Came back from a takeover
If you had a chance with me, well its looking like its probably too late for you
She said I understand what rapping do
But I ain't feeding off your attitude
And I'm a need you to

[Hook :]
Calm down and let me get you high
See you looking for a reason to be mad, but I don't know why
Keep it real you been salty all day and you can't even lie
Cause dawg you been complaining all day
I done ran out everything that I can say
I'm a need you to calm down
I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little
I'm a need you to calm down
I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little
Yeah you really need to calm down
I'm a need you to calm down and relax a little
Cause dawg you been complaining all day
I done ran out everything that I can say

[Verse 2: ]
I'm a need you to calm down, relax a little
Maybe you just over thinking it
You fighting the old while you building a new
Go for that shit while you dreaming it
When you talk all that negative shit
Well I'm just like the people you got me believing it
Social media became a joke, and everybody became a comedian
But we in 20 1-4 and its funny
Wasting time is worse than wasting money
Tryna pay all my bills by the monthly
Until they get somebody to Michael Dunn me
And we went from homeless and hungry
To getting this hot meal with these fries
Happy with the smallest things alive
Talking about bitch don't kill my vibe!
Imagine that, we got our own imagination, so me, I think big non-stop
Turning negatives into positives, it's kind of hard and its doing a lot
So what we do? We smoke our pot
Create some new, got to clear my mind
So I don't got to change the old nigga that I am
I just got to create something fly (exactly)
Keep calm when the bad attack me
Even when they nagging at me
Now I gots fans to back me
They been waiting on the grand finale
Me, I'm just living my word, smoking the funk and I'm speaking with value
Turn up the volume, finna hit y'all with a album
'Til then I'm a need you to

[Hook :][Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Man this is god's poetry, vibe and roll with me, rocking all on this beat
I used to complain about not having shoes, until I seen a man with no feet
Now I feel rich
Money don't make me who I am I never looked down on someone that need a lift
Kindness is a gift
Kinda can smell success, I'm just, I'm just trying to get a whiff
You could say that I'm glad that I had me a childhood (why's that?)
Cause now I'm living out my dreams
Nowadays kids not even living they life, they just staring in they iPhone screens
By any means necessary
Rhyming all that's left in you
Better love the ones next to you
I see a lot of young niggas looking for a sex symbol
Technology is taking over
Feed off these real vibes as you make it older
Young soldier, we all gotta grow
And when you think that you got life figured all out, you realize how much you don't know
Look, after Moms threw me out on the curb
Back when the vibes was louder than words
Yo, I told myself I was gon' get it and god is my witness
My focus was how to be heard
Now I'm here, I see the smiles and tears
I hope this live for a thousand years (it will)
True leaders create more leaders, so tell them haters they ain't never gonna be allowed in here
Cause we characterize (we characterize)
People by actions I see when I stare in your eyes
Forever surprised (why?)
See, everything better whenever I'm high
Break it down

[Hook: Dizzy Wright] x2
I wanna let out all my frustrations
But I ask myself can I feel this way
Ay, ay, ay, ay (ay, ay, ay)
Can I feel this way?
Is it wrong that I feel this way?
Can I feel this way?
Because

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Look, I don't know y'all trying to be
I'm creating my dynasty
Inspire these kids every time I speak (yo!)
I guess they believing us
Like Martin when they tried to black out the black folks and white America mistreated us
My momma said "too bad they needed us"
It's only one race and that's the human race
So that's what I plan to teach my kids
Respond to these fools with silence
As I'm giving y'all the growing process
You can tell me what's next
I ain't heard nothing like it
(how you gon' remember me?)
From living in positive energy without ever having a doubt?
Or praying for my enemies, humbled by the hate
Cause I ain't never take the easy way out
Still I pray
Can I feel this way Lord, tell me can I feel this way
Real man always trying to make a play, just a thought
Got me working at my craft every day
Young men need help
W-w-w-wake up, get right, look in the mirror and I hope you see yourself
I honestly don't want you to be like me
I wanna, inspire you to go and be yourself
We call that love and awareness
The shit that you get for free but don't cherish
Y-you have a beautiful soul, it's no reason to be so embarassed
Cause we just gon' characterize
These people by actions I see when I stare in your eyes
Forever surprised
See, everything better whenever I'm high
And right now

[Hook]x2Sparking up my weed (x4)
*inhale*
*exhale*

[Hook]
Can't stop and it won't stop
Yeah you rap but you won't pop
It's a long shot
Can't stop and it won't stop
Yeah you rap but you won't pop
It's a long shot

You niggas got a long way to go man
Nigga it's a long shot
Yuh

[Verse 1]
I smoke the bombest dro, nigga it's phenomenal
Nigga now we blow, fuckin' with college hoes
Niggas playin' dominos, somebody bout to lose they hold
Rasta flow, my brodee bro Logic know
We Bobby Soxer hoes, we poppin' though
These niggas can knock the flow but I'm too in my zone
Wait a minute though, niggas rather lay up in a ho
I was layin' low trynna get my head right
Ready for a change, ran into a dead end
Turned around and told myself I was finna rap right
Left life on the next flight, ugh
Sky's the limit and you dead right
Dizzy Wright get it every night
Substance to the game made a name
Now I got a message for the lames

[Hook]

Ugh... pretty much

[Verse 2]
East side til' I die ho
I could take over the world with my eyes closed
Legal marijuana patient I ain't worried 'bout 5-0
Changin' up the new God flow
Tell me something you alive fo'
If God died for us, tell me who you finna die fo'
Slow down, ride slow, don't forget your Bible
The Golden Age, you livin' in a cycle
Nigga you dealin' with a psycho
He go by Dizzy Wright though, with the rifle
In 1991, I'm lookin' like Michael
The same year that the police beat up
On Rodney King and gave us something to fight fo'
Ight bro, don't push it, I was scared when I couldn't
And now that I came in I shouldn't
I'm knowin' my limits, but this the beginning
And they gon' support to the fullest
We out here, real rap get them other niggas out here
You feel that? Fuck that, I ain't givin' out no passes
Them lazy ass rappers ain't allowed here
Found here, 'round here with the bosses
Down here, turn my home to my office
Spreadin' light like a King, so a nigga standoff-ish
Always sayin' something when I'm talkin'
This a message to the nigga barkin'

[Hook]

Niggas trynna play me out?
Nigga it's a long shot
Last verse

[Verse 3]
I've been rapping all of my life
I ain't askin' y'all for no stripes
I would go toe to toe with any ho nigga
I ain't askin' y'all for no rights
Fuck yo platinum plaques, if you gettin' lazy
I'm takin' off on yo life
Pick up the pace, as I grace that fight
Can't relate, he a fake cause he ain't that nice
Pick up the eighth that night
Crazy how they praise my life
Nigga workin' like a slave at night
(But you hate that right?)
For my niggas in the cage at night
This the music that'll save yo life
(When it ain't alright)
Left it on a nigga brain all night
Let it sit so it cook right
So many people are attracted to the possibility
Of what it looks like, you hear the hook right?
I was birthed to be the man, ugh
But is it worth to be the man?
I love my life a little too much to hate on your's
So I work for me and my fans
When I'm deserving, I still hustle
Like I have not earned it
Concerned with not nothing I'm learning
These niggas ain't been on my level for weeks
Ahead of my time, let my Legacy speak

[Hook][Verse 1]
Look, I put my soul in this shit
With this ink all on my skin
Think before you ink
I got this ink all on my hands, man
I'm growing up and I'm changing
Don't try to knock me out of my plans
You was bullshitin'
And my grindmode was giving it all I can
Boy I been down, reppin' Vegas
Had to show these niggas what's dedication
More than music, it's more than life
Than tryna figure out who gon' be the next to make it
Put in work and guarantee a show
Real nigga, you just a G.I. Joe
Believe I go see my bro from tryin' to get my real life looking like the T.I. Show
Man I swear to God I hate swearing to God
Tear the stage down I ain't sweating a job
I'm looking good and I'm swaggin' out
And I'm the next to blow and you the next to flop
Real nigga, I ain't scared of shit
Real niggas take care of shit
Wipe me down I like the crown
But when the mic is down this life you never get
I'm 21 and I'm drunk as fuck
Livin' life by myself (nigga)
Tatted up and I'm actin' up, no shirt better check out the belt (nigga)
Vegas raised, Vegas paid
Got up out that bitch to put it on
I'm the first to do it, show improvement
All I gotta do now is set it in stone
Hol' up (Hol' up) Hol' up did a nigga just swag like that? (He did)
Hat to the back, Gucci backpack, spittin' crack on you little niggas
Spittin' facts like that
Coming out the Veg with a rap like that? (He cold)
He cold nigga that's a fact
Trying to get me a platinum plaque
Kill this shit, A$AP the track

[Hook x2]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own

[Bridge]
Don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
Don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
I'm swaggin' out in my zone swear I'm swaggin' out in my zone
Boy, don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
Don't let me get in my zone (my zone)
I'm swaggin' out in my zone swear I'm swaggin' out in my zone

[Verse 2]
They done fucked up, let me out
Stressed me out, set me up
Mad as fuck, I got anger issues
And now you gon' feel 'em when you next to us
Vegas with me, shit evolved
Killin' niggas you don't wanna get involved
You barely good and my good is great
Compared to the team nigga we'll shit on y'all
Real nigga with swag (What?!)
How the fuck that sound nigga
All the fake niggas to the back
You ain't welcome round in my town nigga
Bogart and I'm so retarded
My social skills is over heartless
Niggas talking, bitches talking
Get to walking I don't hear no offers

[Hook x2]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own[Intro: Jarren Benton]
What up Dizzy?

Jarren, Benton. [scratching noises]

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, fuck these niggas, I don't trust these niggas
Pull the knife out the AK, and cut these niggas
Put the knife back on the AK, I throw the AK away, I get the nunchuck and nunck these niggas
I am, out of my mind, Jarren, you gon' really sniff all of those lines?
Where the fuck were you when I was out on my grind?
Stress bout to blow my brains out of my spine
Insane in the membrane, sick with the pen game, y'all niggas been lame
Frickin' faggot, gagged and fucked in the ass like the Gimp did Ving Rhames
Eastside tyrant, little bit of vibe when I flee from the sirens
I hit a nigga in the leg with a tire iron, and crack him in the fucking skull with a fire hydrant
I'm a beast, I'm a god, I'm a killer, I'm a pimp, and I walk with a limp
You're a geek, you're a lame, you're a bitch, you're a fag, bitch you talk with a lisp
Like "Hey Dizz, pull your dick out, all we wanna do is party"
Meanwhile, I'm with your fucking baby mom at the drive-thru at Hardy's
She say "Yeah, I thought you were ballin'", bitch you see the Hardy's at Arby's
Bougie ass trick still let a nigga hit, so I fucked her in the back of an RV
What up to my nigga named Dizzy, hoes throw the pussy at a nigga like a frisbee
Hatin' ass niggas gon' hate, better load up the guns, till the pussy ass niggas come kill me, feel me
Chop ya, body up, put it in my locker, freeze it, cook it, put it in my pasta
The chopper go 'brah' in your mouth like binaca, drop ya, call the fucking coroners and doctors
Duct tape and rape ya, As-SalÄmu `Alaykum, killers from Jamaica, they gon' let you meet your maker
Funk Volume bitch, we don't need a fucking major, Mr Benton sickest motherfucker from Decatur

[Hook]
I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
I'm killing shit
So I'm chilling with a marijuana cloud and my bros
They talking shit but we talking goals
Gettin' money that's all I know
In this shit and I been the shit
And I did this shit all on my own

[Verse 2: Angel Haze]
Okay, they let me loose and I'm at it
Bitch Iâm noose neckin' this rap shit
Got a gang of hoes on my matress
You a bitch nigga, you manson
Man I'm too much for you niggas
I could murder you on yo own song
Give my flow some turbo
End up breakin niggas like O-zone
Kill a nigga quicker than a mili to his temple
Drag his fuckin' body beneath the 2 cylinder
You too weak, and me Iâm too villainous
Ain't shit safe bitch I ain't through killin' it
Bitch I'm hard as I do claim, bitch I'm harder than you claim
I get on anybodyâs song and make that shit part of my food chain
Boom, bang, bang, boom, bitch back, back better gimme some room
I got a wild mind, I'm on a million shrooms
Codeine cups look like a million prunes
I'm ill, and I want it, those two deadly components
Anything I'm in, I always win
Canât even picture havin' opponents
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
They done fucked up, fetch the bong
Remix bitch I'm extra on
Iâm rollin weed, overseas
Funk Volume bitch we finna set the tone
Canât trust 'em, fuck it, put em' in a bucket
Wanna see my dick so you could hug it?
Came a long way for niggas to fuck with me the long way
Independent on the motherfucking budget
Man Iâm never putting this mic down, right now it's my lifestyle
Change your lives on a high cloud, I got marijuana all in my white owl
So the hoes wanna hit it, niggas get to witness the bitches that really groupie for a livin'
Iâm at the show, she at the front, now she at the hotel trying to get the motherfuckin' business
Hold up, hold up, why everybody on my dick?
Is it cause I rip songs, hit bongs, with hit songs and niggas wonder how I'm getting on like this
Damn, find another lover
Can't trust 'em cause we tired of each other
Brother, Las Vegas will never have another
Tell XXL want the motherfuckin' cover[Intro]
Yo, weâre here man, four hundred thousand downloads, forty thousand sales, itâs Fly America man

[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Letâs toast to the fact that I rose from the cracks
Now they gotta pay me for the shows and the raps
Donât you get too crazy, got my bros in the back
Shout out my nigga Scrap, heâll leave you where you at
But I ainât into that Iâm tryna keep it so cool
Said I was the man, well man, thatâs so true
Even without a signal my messages go through
Said you want it, but I need it, Iâm guessing we both do
Told you that Iâm here and donât take it for granted
Tryna open up these doors and I ainât being romantic
I dropped pre-season, now they starting to panic
Better tell Bruno Mars that we the best on the planet
Iâmma get it âcause Iâm so efficient
With more lines than a coke addiction
This broken system canât hold me victim, I know the difference
Frigid, they scratch their head saying âno he didnâtâ
Go hard, shut down your bars like the prohibition
My family trippinâ âcause Iâm rolling the dice
All the wrongs in my life, Iâm here making them right
Yeah it costs to be the boss, thatâs why Iâm paying the price
Turned a dream into a thing, what a hell of a life
Itâs Battles

[Interlude]
Knocking it out this time little bitches

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Trippy thoughts baby, donât be scared of the future
Donât pretend that you like being somebody that you ainât used to
My flow cold, my mother could see that way before computers
It started in me and now I got game for all the intruders
Cause itâs world peace âtill the end of times, smoking weed and preventing crime
Tell em all my niggas finna shine (yo all my niggas finna shine)
Look, when we yelling loud, niggas told me to settle down
I sped up just to leave suckas, yâall fell off, and I held it down
I swear I could sell anything, pretty much too big for anything else
Look, without the wealth I was spitting that shit they felt
And busting shit in the studio in that Vegas heat until I melt
Come back to life, told âem I got dabs on that championship belt
Nice guy but, I ainât tryna to 2-step with niggas
Them thirsty niggas only make me wanna suplex a nigga (got âem)
Fuck who you met nigga that dickriding shit is whack to us
Them cool kids that wonât change is making motherfuckers adapt to us
