[Intro: Heavy D]
Yeah, this is, uh, an untouchable funk you know what I'm sayin'
This is for all the players and playettes, wherever you at you dig
I'm talkin' about from this side to that side
East side, west side, your side, my side
It's all about being funky. man

[Verse 1]
Ayo, give me that microphone
It's Heavy D the baritone and I'm home alone, dig it
And I'm always stayin' freshly dipped on 1-2-5th
Where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin' spliff
Okay, okay, okay, okay, it's Heavy D again
Hallelujah, I'm on your TV screen again
You see me on your MTV and on your BET
And on your local focal point video show
Nigga, this how it flow so fly like an eagle
No sequels, no weed, but I get love from all the thugs
Cause they still my people
I'm dynamic punks panic when they see me
They get all shook up when my mic's hooked up
Let's get it on

[Hook] (x2)
Untouchables at your door
(Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
How should I plead, forever thuggin' on a quest to get G's
Runnin' from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin'
Thinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' G's
They after a playa but I won't let 'em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine
I can't sleep, close my eyes, I see wicked things
I keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger
Rollin' down the 405, beware of stangers
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it til I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me
Before the penitentiary
Let's get it on

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do
I have all the honeys sayin' "Go Pu'!"
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps
And sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin'
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walkin'
Niggas got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody wanna this
But them youth don't trouble we
Because they fall victim to what they see, hey
I keeps it "Reel To Reel", like my last album title song
But I understand, it takes a year for niggas to catch on
Hit 'em in the head dog, so let's get it on, yeah

[Bridge: Notorious B.I.G.]
Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to get wicked in the joint, uh, Notorious is glorious
*coughing*

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas know who's the mind blower, the weed grower
Have you seen doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower
B.I.G. top notch with the Glock check your pockets
And your sockets it's just the way my pops taught me
When you throw the drop check 'em throughly
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggas don't make no moves
When I'm slingin' in the hood I don't fake no moves, aight
Reminiscin' on my swinger days
When I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yeah, she had the Gucci roots I had Carducci Suits
Oshkosh-begosh, Coca-Cola, lookin' real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin' Bucktown
MAC-11 cocked back niggas better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it onYeah
Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker
(Right on, right on, right on) Who is it?
Well it's Grand Puba honey
With my man Stud Doogie love
Droppin' 2000, dig the way this go down
Check it

[Verse 1]
I hit a flow all dipped in lotion
Sit back and sip moe as I'm countin' my doe
Grand Puba macks well, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honies know cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then its all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie
And dance body to body
Step one: first you grab honey by the waist
Step two: then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three: then ya look her dead in the face
Step four: now its time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teasa's, the one who wants the money and the visa's
I'mma tell honies straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, Dig it
This ones designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

[Hook]
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya and ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh yeah I lke it
And ya say ( I like it)

[Verse 2]
Could it be I've stayed away too long
Seems MC's be wishing I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star
Its only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
Its no doubt I come real with that
The butter track
The one that makes the honeis hit the bed mat
Im energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe, cause when it comes to gettin' down
I'm gettin' looser than a crackheads hair weave
And I, bet ya my dolly, while ya never find another style like this
If ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba ingnite your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
But I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears,tears; dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit'em with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb baby
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

[Hook]
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
And ya say New York City
Ooooh, yeah I like it (no doubt)
And ya say New York City
Ooooh, yeah I like it
Ha ha, and ya say

Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Ninety-five flav, and I'm out
(Oooh, yeah I like it)
(Oooh, yeah. . . . . I like it)[Intro: KRS-One]
Come! Come with me now! To a time, long forgotten

[Verse One: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
I grew up in the streets, like everyone else
But instead of pushin drugs I push knowledge in self
While them cats was in the back, smokin them moolies
I was buildin with the Gods, who used to wear kufi's
Africa pendents, with sevens on them
Real black man summit y'all never saw 'em
The cops caught 'em, real leaders, real street preachers
Black Panthers style Poor Righteous Teachers
This before the cell phones and the beepers
Conscious black men with fly new sneakers
Both styles came from us, guns bust
We were Criminal Minded but In God We Trust
Not that white man God the other one
We didn't call that God we called our brother one
And our sister was the Earth, peace God
No need to act it (Now let me bless y'all with some jewels)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom
Justice, equality (Food) clothing
Shelter, love, peace, happiness
THESE ARE THE JEWELS TO LIFE


[Verse Two: KRS-One] (*DJ Premier Scratchin) (**Grand Puba)
(*Oh my God!) Where you think the cypher come from? (The Gods!)
Who you think them cops were runnin from? (The Gods!)
The streets were hard but the streets had Gods and Earths
(**Sun, Moon and Stars!!!) This is my universe
Rebirth, a new way of seein
Seein black people as celestrial beings
To raise our whole self esteem in
We started Third Eye seein and seein what Martin was dreamin
Gods on the boulevard buildin on life
Wise Intelligence, King Sun, Just Ice
King Aziatic nobody's equal
Rakim, these are enlightened people
The 5 percent, visit The School Of Mecca in Harlem
If you never went, It's good time spent
I'll bet ya come out with a new tactic
But while we here (Kris go 'head, just drop it)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)

[Verse Three: Grand Puba]
I deal with actual facts, I keep it right and exact
And If in doubt I do without so I could stay on my route
The original man the true ruler of the land
Related to the universe by the Pineal gland
Armed with epidermis so the sun won't burn us
It's natural while others fry they in the furnace
It's God Body don't let the 10 percent fool ya
Teachin lies and false religion so that they can rule ya
Why oh why got you lookin to the sky
Got you believin that you 'gon get some heaven when you die
Meanwhile, the 6th sense 'til you turn
Unit followed by 21 ciphers you should run
196 million, 900,040 thousand, and we still in public housin
Now It's our turn, listen
Like KRS-One say, homey, You Must Learn[Intro (Spoken): Heavy D]
This one definitely goes out on the censorship tip, so everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We're gonna teach these people out there that we can say what we want to say, the right way
You know what I'm saying? So what we're gonna do is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire. Yo Pete Rock! Make it clear

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now till then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in a verse to make a party bubble
So mister censorship, tell me what's your problem?
There's girlies on the corner, if wifey can't solve them
How does she say it? I'm curious, G
Does she say "honey love me" or "baby baby fffffun me?"
Anyway, we'll say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G. Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
You're telling me don't curse on my verse
I did it worse, first I put a curse on every verse
I kinda got outrageous
Check it, even made a record how I'm doing all the B-I-T-C-H'es
Ducks, it wasn't for the bucks
Every word that you heard is 'cuz I didn't give a f-- aww shucks!
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kind of hot
So I'mma let profanity retire
Hey, but if worse comes to worse I'll curse you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
I won't curse. I'll take a famous curse word and just say "kcuf"
Kcuf flipped around the other way means, huh?
Boy, when I do it, see I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic, then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots and step with my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means . . . [coughing]
Is this a curse? I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
(C.L. Smooth) It's time to kick a verse
God-Cypher-Divine, we can't curse

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Go ahead, ask me will I kick a curse in a verse? I'll say "nope"
Grab you by your hair, wash your mouth out with soap
Thinking to be the last one with the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church playing Bingo
Sounds of the Mecca don, fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cussed like a sailor
Better yet dialect dirty like a subway
Freak a funky loop and I make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor: don't curse

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Uhh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kids want to peep it, but you want to beep it, what?
I feel like slapping that sticker on your (Chill, chill, say butt!)
I'm too magical, rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me, man, don't you know that this would be
Worse than Stephen King's Misery?
So clean all profanity, still and yet all the man'll be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
Kick another verse, and don't forget not to curse!

[Interlude (Spoken): Heavy D]
Hey yo Big Daddy, check this out. I'm about to do some old sly, slick, smooth on the trick tip stuff
I'm gonna bring my little cousin, the producer of this joint, his name is DJ Pete Rock, definitely part of one of the family, you know what I'm saying, G?
He's about to flex on this here mic and get busy like his big cousin, you know what I'm saying? Check it
Pete Rock, kick a verse but don't curse!

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
God bless, but I can't mess
Around with the curses, so I'mma kick verses
Or a verse, Soul Brother number 1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Yo I'm a bad bro, let's start the flow
I'mma kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse 'cuz Heavy D said so
Now I'mma get back to the subject, get wreck
If you think I'm bluffing just check
With the crew, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

[Interlude (Spoken): Q-Tip]
Yeah man, the Abstract Poet, Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest here to wreck!
You know what I'm saying, got my man Pete Rock and my man D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out

[Verse 7: Q-Tip]
Flim-flam-flim, lick my big black stuff
Must I kick a curse to be rough enough?
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine!
Visions in my head when it's dealing with hits
If I have four girls, then I lick eight [its]
Wait--don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum-diddly-Hev is a fave of my mama's
So I blew out and get mad lifted
Don't have to say [kcuf] to show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cuz I reached my twenty-first
Hev D! Don't drop a curse

[Verse 8: Heavy D]
Peace, peace. Peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse, that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the silky clean rhythm
Before I say goodbye let me tell you how I hit 'em:
C.L., Pete Rock, G. Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and, uh, me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the streets
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worse came to worse (we'd have all said a curse!)

[Outro]
Free Slick Rick! [repeated to fade-out]Intro:
(Let's do it) Yeah (yeah) get down situation get down no doubt 95. (We're
Talkin' 2000) How we represent. Come a kick it with

Intro:
A little of this and a little of that (and a little of that) (x4)

Verse 1:
Check it I get the gumtions to make your conjuction function
So honey get it straight or be on your roller blades and skate
My style switch fast like a rash then it get you itchin'
My flow is crisp like a bucket full of Cornnels chicken
I mold the beat like pottery lyrics flow like blood through the artery
With more rhymes then numbers at the lottery
You know my stello have my doe and watch me drop a flow
I wax shit up and make it shine like I was Mop & Glow
So come on baby love let's put it on no fakin' moves
Let's flip on it heads I win and tails you lose
GOT CHA
Grand Puba comes with alladat
Because I got more game then quarters in the laundry mat
Uh we keep it tight the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me
No doubt cause we hit 'em with...

Hook

Verse 2:
Dig it I got to be one of the baddest brothers on the planet
I'm baggin' honies and they all got bodies just like Janet
I play it safe never takin' chickenheads for granted
I'm Superman and Lois takes my rhymes to Daily Planet
I got more promise than Thomas who makes English Muffins
I do more stickin' in chicken than Stove Top Stuffing
No doubt about it hun I hit from here to China
When I drop the D minor watch me soggy your vagina
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie droppin' clonkite
Prefer the chocolate like the outside of a Klondike
That's how it go and that's the way it's designed
So you can Stroke Me Down I don't mind
We keep it tight and that's the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me

Hook

Outro:
You gotta be that shit (take your time young man). The way it's designed to
Ease your mind in the 95 flavor. No doubt no questions aked cause we
Fulfill that task. We keep it real like Jill youknowhatI'msayin'? We gonna
Move it on for the year 2000. Big up all you New York City style squads in
It to the fullest
Live your life (x6)
No doubt that's what we talking about. (C'mon and just get down) (With
Grand Puba and Stud Doogie just get down) (x4) (Big Jeff in the hosue the
Neyru in the house and the K to the I to the D is in the house. 2000. 2000[Hook]
We are Black (yeah)
Stolen from mommy
Can't make it back
That's why we must learn our roots and culture
The more things change, the more they stay the same (4x)


[Grand Puba]
I made a joint called "Wake Up", I'm Black and I'm proud
Love vs. Hate, plus Times Runnin' Out
I hit you with the God like flow
Knowledge is to know so go get it and grow
You wanna know what's goin' on now, play some of my joints from 20 years ago
Cause ain't a damn thing changed, Black people still dying in vain
Shoot first, don't even ask questions
Stun gunnin', no rights, just arrestin'
Fear of a Black man, that was stolen from the Motherland
And I'm tired of them slave movies
Fifty years done past, still feelin' like the seventies

[Hook]

[Grand Puba]
Now hold up, wait a minute
Where my soldiers at like No Limit
This joint here ain't made for the timid
Same old shit since Ancient Kemet
I came in the door, no tricks, no gimmicks
Black Man God, everybody wanna mimic
Steal my culture, take the wealth
And then you wanna front like you did it for yourself?
But uh, that shit gon' end today
When it comes to this, nigga I don't play
I'ma keep dropping bombs till I'm old and grey
So uh, move nigga, better get out the way
The new Django comin' at an angle
This shit be the new Black Star Spangled
Grand Puba, you know how I put it down
Like a cypher goin' round and round
Circle

[Hook]

[Grand Puba]
Radio, bet you they won't play this
Brand Nubian, keep 'em on the blacklist
(We gotta protect these babies!)
(How many more unnecessary sacrifices?)
(How many more marches?)
(Aren't your feet tired?)
(What happened to our 40 Acres and a Mule?)
(Shit, I wanna build a casino too!)
And me too!
(We need group economics!)
(We need organization!)
(We need unification!)
(The youth must respect the OGs)
(And the OGs must teach the seeds!)
(And mama please burn that weave!)
Shorty you wildin'!
I ain't say that!
I ain't gon' get no shows fuckin' wit'  you!Yeah...
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Grand Puba, Dattie X... dig it

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Get up out my way, it's Grand Pub's turn to shine
Hood MC's ride the pine and get paid no nevermind
One time as I sew it up like Dr. Frankenstein
Chickens ride the pony cause the rhyme flow genuine
As I do it like that, do it like this
Shorty watch your step or you might get Rocked like Chris
Are you feelin this? You dig the way it's going down?
Now we back in town watch all the chickens crowd around
Niggas try to duplicate my flow but it's difficult
Like a game of Yahtzee
Chickens stress me out like paparazzi
As I flip a flow you desire
Dattie blaze those trees and let's start this forest fire
My rhymes carry like the weight on Barry
Stack cheddar like Combs and buy homes like Larry
I be smoother than Tal, Sharp-ton like Al
When you ballin everybody want to be your pal
No dilly-dally, baggin up the shorter alley
Bouncin in German cars, still playin shot-ball
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you
For sure dog cause this is how we do

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
Ah shit, I see I'm in the mix
Watch the green van cause inside's the dicks
The prayer beads bleeds from the crucifix
Went tight comin out boy I be down in six
Or when the sun go down, or when it's round in the BX
Cats on the concourse, still call me DX
Bums on the street often ask me for change
What's change when I'm tryin to save up for the Range?
I want the whole world and my old girl back
Change that -- I want half the world, and fuck my old girl
You can play the hell out, like those that came before ya
Your style is butt, similar to a cobra
That's your pimp strut
But what you foes is really doin
Is leaving your empire in ruins
I'm the problem solver
I got the brand new revolver
But I got a new album too
I want to be here for that money and the rest of my crew
Y'all know it too -- a nigga like me is due

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Verse 3: Puba]
Now you know I gots to come back strong
See I been doing this too goddamned long
For me to ever try to come back wrong
Check my pockets and my empty light just came on
Don't wanna do wrong so I think I'm best to make this song
Undeniably satisfiably master microphone mutilator
None greater, ain't no Automator
Grand Puba and Dattie, riding shotty in the Mazarati
As we come and blaze you niggas body

[Verse 4: Sadat]
Corner poets get smacked and hit, savagely bit
I go git and then you out of it, permission to quit
I mean right, I keep the green light specials
Half price a slice, you blink twice
I done picked up the dice
I'm that nice, Dattie X the party-starter
Number one heart-ripper-aparter
More vice and gambling than Las Vegas, Nevada
I try harder every day
It's all work and no play

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)Yeah, bleep bleep bleep
Hey yo this is how we gonna hit it off...

Chorus:

So drop the Cronkite nigga (2000)
Check out how we flip shit for (2000)
Stud Doogie runnin' shit for (2000)
Grand Puba flippin' shit for (2000)

Here comes the brotha from the future
Man, I got what suits ya
Fake mc's go away and let your label prostitute ya
Give me my space and let the swinger swing
Nigga don't you know that Jane can't even stop this crazy thang
I like to boast cause I'm the host with the most
Bag a few honeys and i'm... (Space Ghost!!!)
I got niggas head-bobbin' with no problem
I kick 31 flavors so call me Baskin Robbins, uhh
I gets down cause I travel like sound
Grand Puba's so fast they got my picture on a Greyhound
Here goes the tizm, get ya lifted like izm
If these devils ain't got my money then I got some off the prison
So honey here's more than a rent
For dollars and sense, see I leave shit bent
So don't even come with that 69, hon
Cause I told ya last time, 68 and I owe ya one
Back up and let Puba do his thing
Cause a nigga wanna crib like Eddie Murphy had in Boomerang
So butt niggas get the steppin'
I gets to the root like beer
Lyrics flow like an automatic weapon
You can't see this or much greater
Rough like Terminator, sendin' niggas down like elevators
So like Beavis and Butthead...(he he he he)
Go away like 94, we drop the Kronkite nigga

Chorus

No shame in the game I puts the pedal to the metal
Be a father to my son, ask the Bulldogs and pedal (?)
Puba gots that shit that hits in every ghetto
Straight from New York, L.A. to ____
Honey, there's no need to hunt
Whatever you want, just make sure when you come you bring a blunt
This is for the year 2-circle-circle-circle
Niggas lookin' stupid like it's Friday and they Urkel
Did I say that?
Doogie hits the scratch
Niggas can't match, baggin' bootys by the batch
That's how we do at a theatre near you
Do the show, bag the doe and disappear like the zoo
Then I hit home, to rest my dome
Unplug the phone and put a joint on the bone
I kick the style longtime ya know
Niggas can't see this, so you know how that shit goes
Nigga it's gonna take a miracle
Call me a cab so I can Cal-a-way and catch your hi-di-hi-di-ho
Fuck that, my style's all that and a bag of snacks
Ran through Josie and her pussycat
I'm the Scooby with the Doo
I like my philly with the brew
All ya'll niggas talkin' shit about Puba, fuck you...
Ya know what you can do?
You can lick the twins when I pull 'em outta skins
And I put 'em in your face, you can tell me how it tastes
Cause its the Kronkite, nigga

Chorus[GPM] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
"There's just one thing I wanna say.."
[GPM] The reel to reel to reel to reel yo
"There's just one thing I wanna say.."
[GPM] Copy copy copy copy copy
"There's just one thing I wanna say.."
[GPM] We gonna hit it down like this, y'all know the flav
"There's just one thing I wanna say.."
[GPM] Uhh, Alamo, is you wit me?
"What goes around comes back around again.."
GPM[] Stud Doogie, is you wit me?
"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] S.O.S., is you wit me?
"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] Yo this how we gon' bust it down, yo you know the flavor
"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] You know what time is it, check it yo, this how we flow

[Grand Puba Maxwell]
Here comes the Puba and you know I won't fake it
Usually bust records when gettin butt naked
Made for the Benzi, drive a nigga trendy
Pump the tape, grab your dick, get with the Puba frenzy
C'mon honey sing, don't you, try to eject
_Slow Down_'s what you say, once my joint gets erect
Some try to copy but they just can't sketch it
Some try to follow but they just can't catch it
With the boom boom tap, yeah alla dat
Huh, I'm livin fat, me fall off, there'll be none of that
See who's the one to flip it? Quick to tell a nigga to zip it
Stud drink the 40 cause we ain't got time to sip it
Grand Puba got body
Kick some of them, some of those, and some yardies
As dope as they come, suckers sing or hum
Don't try to step to this, you know your shit is slum
First batter up well here's the pitch - it's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
The one who arouse, as I browse for a blouse
Kick styles by the piles, as I leave a trail for miles
Skins when I please, hit from here to Tel Aviv
I'm gettin G's, no more time for the line of free cheese
Here's the four one one hon, the one who gets the job done
I know you know the flavor of the Puba

"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] Yeah yeah yeah yeah, na-nah nah nah nah, this how we bump it yo!
"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] Yaknahmsayin? Big Jeff in the house, we gon' move it like this
"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] Ha hah, Baby Pop Baby Pop in the house, bust how we bust it down
"What goes around comes back around again.."
[GPM] Y'all you know the flavor.. Sincere Allah, check check check check!

[Grand Puba Maxwell]
O-kay o-kay o-kay, what more could I say?
Alamo get the boom and.. parlay parlay
I'm far from the average, civilize the savage
When I'm low on protein I'm with the bean soup and cabbage
Skins on the diet, kick the flavor, cause a riot
Do a show and get the dough and then I'm off to the Hyatt
So tie me on the spliff, ain't no ands or if
And if you really wanna riff you just might end up playin stiff
Girbauds hangin baggy, Hilfiger on the top
Knapsack on the back, that's just my flavor Hobbes
As my man gives a zigga zigga, watchin three grow bigga bigga
To Pos K, that's my nigga
Here goes the wreck, whaddayou expect?
If you wanna see some wreck, send cash, not a check
Grand Puba, more than a public figure
Quick to kick the bone up the butt of a golddigger
Now Tic-Tac-Toe means I hit three in a row
If I do a show then you better have my dough
Low, low, well how low can you go?
Call on Grand Puba if you really need a pro
Cause my shit's more rugged than G.I. Joe
Don't front honey, act like you know
Now big up to my Brooklyn mob (Brooklyn! Brooklyn!)
Big up to my Uptown mob (Uptown! Uptown!)
Now brothers wanna diss me cause it's my turn to burn
My best advice for the brothers is to sit back and learn
I don't diss nobody to be somebody
I just like to kick the flavor to make the people party
See all I'm sayin, is respect due
Those who tried to follow, sorry I left you
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie and Alamo
So if you ever want the flavor you know where to go
Now how we go..

Yeah, ha ha ha!
The reel to reel, yeah yeah yeah, this is how we move it
You know the flavor, y'all know the flavor, you know the flavor
Here we go yo, and you don't stop (big up to all the people)
Big up! Big up!
Big Jeff hold tight! Ha hah, ha hah!
On and on y'all
Time to get gone
Word is bond[Intro: KRS-One]
Come! Come with me now! To a time, long forgotten

[Verse One: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
I grew up in the streets, like everyone else
But instead of pushin drugs I push knowledge in self
While them cats was in the back, smokin them moolies
I was buildin with the Gods, who used to wear kufi's
Africa pendents, with sevens on them
Real black man summit y'all never saw 'em
The cops caught 'em, real leaders, real street preachers
Black Panthers style Poor Righteous Teachers
This before the cell phones and the beepers
Conscious black men with fly new sneakers
Both styles came from us, guns bust
We were Criminal Minded but In God We Trust
Not that white man God the other one
We didn't call that God we called our brother one
And our sister was the Earth, peace God
No need to act it (Now let me bless y'all with some jewels)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom
Justice, equality (Food) clothing
Shelter, love, peace, happiness
THESE ARE THE JEWELS TO LIFE


[Verse Two: KRS-One] (*DJ Premier Scratchin) (**Grand Puba)
(*Oh my God!) Where you think the cypher come from? (The Gods!)
Who you think them cops were runnin from? (The Gods!)
The streets were hard but the streets had Gods and Earths
(**Sun, Moon and Stars!!!) This is my universe
Rebirth, a new way of seein
Seein black people as celestrial beings
To raise our whole self esteem in
We started Third Eye seein and seein what Martin was dreamin
Gods on the boulevard buildin on life
Wise Intelligence, King Sun, Just Ice
King Aziatic nobody's equal
Rakim, these are enlightened people
The 5 percent, visit The School Of Mecca in Harlem
If you never went, It's good time spent
I'll bet ya come out with a new tactic
But while we here (Kris go 'head, just drop it)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)

[Verse Three: Grand Puba]
I deal with actual facts, I keep it right and exact
And If in doubt I do without so I could stay on my route
The original man the true ruler of the land
Related to the universe by the Pineal gland
Armed with epidermis so the sun won't burn us
It's natural while others fry they in the furnace
It's God Body don't let the 10 percent fool ya
Teachin lies and false religion so that they can rule ya
Why oh why got you lookin to the sky
Got you believin that you 'gon get some heaven when you die
Meanwhile, the 6th sense 'til you turn
Unit followed by 21 ciphers you should run
196 million, 900,040 thousand, and we still in public housin
Now It's our turn, listen
Like KRS-One say, homey, You Must LearnGrand Pub'.. Scaramanga Shallah.. Sadat X
Bout to hit this, word up

[Grand Puba]
Once the Grand spread his stuff, pockets fluff like Jiffy Puff
"Inside Stuff," Ahmad Rashad know I keep it rough
Blazin for the two-cen' and after black
Once I spit the half to that, shorties form a line at the welcome mat
Godly ways and action be fo' yo' satisfaction
Chicks feel me like attraction, move shoes like Foot Action
Justice Cipher Born be to leave the mic torn
Rhyme flow vibrates and kill flow like radiation
You know the deally, watch me flip it on the really
Once the God begin to bomb it, all beware Haji comet
Plain and simple, I shine like a iced out Presidential
Gold fronts be the dental as I smack you in the mental
Deadly flows that I use'll bust a vein in your temple
I go back like a rental
He Allah Justice Islam for the fam
Got no problems to hit you all with the plan

Chorus: Sir Menelik (repeat 2X)

7XL, the Gods live well, cash clientele
Checks out the mail, sippin Guinness while
Flippin bidness well, in a tailor made whip
Accelerate, make papes while we marinate

[Sir Menelik]
With mad game I kick the King Verbal, God Wisdom
Cypher Seven Twenty built two circles, it's no fabrication
Chicks with bricks, catch the sensation
Spectacular interaction, my raps capture your fascination
Still I maintain finesse, explain in text, train the best
Troopers usin telekinetic prophetic maneuvers
To gain blessin, Puba, Sir Menelik, Sadat assemble
The rock tight, collaboration
One physical jewel formed to the fill the manifest, dest'
Jehovah's Knight, give the devils stressed out
Spark up remarkably, live palatial, gems glacial
Ladies stay in my facial labels pay to keep me laced
Sports the short fade, paid suede soft butter Avirex
Turbotron don intellect, mental flex connects aspects
Got cream like NASDAQ, so to competition don't be abstract
The Extra Large mack reacts

Chorus

[Sadat X]
Her black panties up the antes which was well spent on
There was cash bent on for porn, latex worn
It's on, sting like a thorn in the morn' for self-guilt
And think about the ass you kilt
From one stone, great cities was built
We're terrorists with a twist, Menelik, you must know this!
The Brand Nubian name, will live long in the annals of fame
And if she say she don't get down well that's game
She ran the same shit yesterday with bird from what I heard
Over on Eighth Ave or up at the Tomb
What's a nigga to assume, if you lead me to the room?
It ain't all cool, I'll still wild and pee in the pool
Then cap a fool from a thing that was in high school
I'm international, passport, onslaught with flyer mouths
The red lights of Amsterdam, exotic chicks from Surinam
Haha, Great X

[Hook x2]

7XL, 7XL...(Sadat X)
When you say the name X, think synonymous wit fame
Only draw love off the mention of my name
I got a rhyme or two left then I'm a blend to the side
Go out on top like Jim Brown at his peak, I get wreck like ery week
Get my freak on, who dares to speak on
My armed forces recon, penatrating like decon
Guerilla tactics, stage theatrics
She's laying on the mattress
I'm hiking up the black dress
Finesse called on me to bless
I pulled the S off my varsity sweater, fine tuned to the letter
So let's make these stacks and max, relax, be waxed
The tracks receive faxs wit my picture, in a cowboy hat
Now top that, yo, kid, top that
Kid got blown away at exactly where you're sitting
Just the other day but nobody's admitting
To the crime, I'm a MC not a MD
The best in history or maybe one of the top 3
Says myself, no diggedy

(Large Professor)
I be synonymous to king, fling niggas to the mat
Like an acrobat, flipping the mental ass whipping
Is served when I un-nerved another wack Jack imposter
Trying to fraud, you gots to get the fuk down wit the Lord
Finesse, whether you think you're pimp status or the best
Mad crazy or stupid, find a hot beat and loop it
For what it's worth, I've been a hip-hopper from birth
Try to disrespect and get your ass played up like a smurf
I'm running over the track, type of nigga to stack
One million, hit my moms, then fuk it, make a trillion
To start, showing the world who's the man wit the heart
That's about to blast off on these kids that's mad soft
Don't fuk wit Large Professor or you get your ass mauled
So ah, say no more, them niggas that supports
Large Profess, Lord Finesse and Dat X for the tour
Grand Puba, who's probably coming back from Aruba
Wit the skill to build, I'm saying peace, you niggas, chill

(Grand Puba)
Dig it, I be that nigga wit the creamy ass rhyme flow
My shit's so hot, I'll burn the ass of an Eskimo
I'm saying though, it be the Grand flipping flam
Giving love to my fans and you know this man
My composition leaves competition wishing
They could be in my postition cuz I did it wit no ass kissing
I'll be there like Michael Jackson and you don't stop
Until you get enuff and I'll be damn if my nose drop
I speak Actual facts on how I feel
Don't worry baby, wit Puba, there's no waiting just to exhale
I bag dimes like Jada, step through playa haters
Keep niggas moving like a fuking escalator
Because it's poetry in motion
Pube keep it smooth like lotion, keeping MC's lost like Billy Ocean
Dig what I'm saying I be a buck 85 on the weigh-in

(Lord Finesse)
It goes dip dip diving, check who you sizing
It's the wize civilizing, pockets stll rising
When I drop it, I'm futuristic like Fiber Optic
Didn't buy my album, you played yourself, should of copped it
Nuthin could beat my elite rhymes throwing your hands kid
That better be a peace sign
You don't want it, that's my steelo, how we on it
When we do our thing, niggas spread the word like informants
But still advancing, skills enhancing
We got up on a shooken offbeat like white people dancing
We're too bugged, true thugs
Quick to get in that ass in ways that homo's wouldn't approve of
I'm not yapping, just rapping
Don't care if you're gold or platinum, don't think it can't happen
Whether wit a beat or acapella, it's the mic Rockafella
Strictly out for the mozarella
Fuk guns and toolies, we don't betray movies
It's yours truely that's smoothly, still sounds groovy
You can't do me or dis me, don't try to get wit me
My style is tricky like spelling Mississippi
Strictly, come and get me, if you can flip me
If this flow was whisley, I have you muthafukas tipsy
The ghetto type playas that caters
Famous to you spectators, the rhyme sayers, catch you laterIntro:
(Let's do it) Yeah (yeah) get down situation get down no doubt 95. (We're

With more rhymes then numbers at the lottery

So come on baby love let's put it on no fakin' moves
Let's flip on it heads I win and tails you lose

I got more promise than Thomas who makes English Muffins
I do more stickin' in chicken than Stove Top Stuffing
No doubt about it hun I hit from here to China
When I drop the D minor watch me soggy your vagina
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie droppin' clonkite
Prefer the chocolate like the outside of a Klondike

Check it I got the nack to put the groove in your back
Squeeze a rhyme like a pistol cause I'm smooth as Harvey Bristol
I come clean with more protein and overtein
The way I heat shit up you think my jaws was dipped in gasoline
Whoa now that's a fire
Puba got the hi-tech shit while other MC's come cheap like propiya
So let's get down to the situation
Smooth like a Temptation Puba makes it good like penetration
That's how it's suppose to be
No question so don't you put a rush on me

Give me the doe you better ask somebody if ya don't know

Hook

Verse 2:
Dig it, see I like to know where you got the notion

See I ain't no joke cause I got mad style wicked and wild
Mama's second child throwin' rappers to the pile
Games point blank call me Shabba cause I Rank
Don't run around with toast cause my people on a tank
Clown won't get me cause I'm God body
Moses asked me how to part the Red Sea
Trippin' MC's up like astroturf
Puttin' wack MC's outta buisness like Woolworth

Can't trust a girl who couldn't standin' up tryin' to get a whole lot of
Niggas wet

[Verse One: Psycho Les]
It's the wicked, nigger with the super dick
Fuckin' ho's like I'm supposed to be in a flick, UH!
One time, I tap yo mind, I got you hummin'
Now you want to press rewind
I pour rhyme in your ear to develop suds
Slice the fuckin' Philly and break up the buds
Who's Buddha? I don't know, is it a special
Stick a fork in your neck and pop a blood vessel
The hispanic shaft packs a gat, too
Permanent scar your ass like a tattoo
Slam dunk the funk in your trunk, punk!
Da Doom Doom, Do Doom

[Verse Two: Fashion]
Yeah, cool makin' moves nigger so smooth
Scarin' ya, hangs up in the 'Skills
But Queens is like the area
I stare at ya, tear at ya, break that back
Now crack the fuckin' sack and roll that shit black!
Act like you want a nigger and watch me hit him
Then I have my shottie' let my brother Divine get him
We got him, ho's comin' through in the clutch
She said I only suck that dick cause I love you so much
Said I only lick them balls cause you so game tight
And you keep my ass climbing the fuckin' walls at night
So hit me, hit me one time, let me flex it
Crew's still makin' moves but now I've gots to exit

[Hook] 4x
::Are you ready? Y'all ready for him?::

[Verse Three: Juju]
Hold up, you know I gots to get my wreck off
Fuckin' rugged like a dog about to bite your neck off
Police still puttin' fear in the hearts of mad crews
Leavin' people lyin' dead in the street with no clues
Soul like a mother got the funk on lock
You can hear my sounds echo through the urban block
Got stacks of stocks, and fat beats to knock
Got you open now you're hopin' that the junkyard rocks

[Verse Four: Grand Puba]
Okay here goes the blow, the bag, the mint
Grand time to represent flavor so strong
Fills the room like Buddha stick, uhuh, don't like choke
Gotta get paid so we're tryin' to go for broke
Beatnuts hit the rhythm and I join right with 'em
Niggas can't see this flow so it's time to down sit 'em
I kick the flow for the niggas with the bald heads
Dreads, and 'fros, honey's, but no ho's
Oops! I didn't mean to call you ho, bitch
But when you try to clock the pocket that's that bullshit!
So let's get down with one of New York's finest
Seed to the brain like Primatine to clear the sinus
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie with the mad style
Beatnuts comin' with the rugged(Hey You, watch out now!)
It's on motherfucker, can't you see that?
No shame in the game, so Doogie where the weed at?

[Are you ready? Y'all ready for us?](Chorus 5x)(Well my beloved black brothers and sisters
It is time for the family to unite
I've said that we can have no family
Unless we love each other
It is no crime for the black man to love himself
And to love his brother as he loves himself
To every one of you that are under the sound of our voice)

[Hook]
It's only one way in, two ways out
One way in, two ways out

I need this money, god damn I need this money
I wanna buy the cars and the jewels and bag the honeys
So little shorty hits the corner of his block
To get his ghetto props, and hit up all the heads with the black tops
Smokers line up to buy the sickness
The green paper stacked on the quickness with the thickness
Now shorty's buying cars and jewels cause he swelling
Tricking on hoes, hoteling from the drug selling
Shorty's only sixteen, asshole full of green
Totes around a semi-automatic gun machine
First of the month is his best nut
Yo you crack monsters know the routine, line the fuck up
Yo I got the jumbo
(Yo yo, I get one on credit, man?)
No shorts dumb ho might as well forget it
(But I'm starving, slick)
That's not my problem, bitch
(A-yo yo, how many cracks can I get if I suck your duck - uh! uh!)
Get the fuck out of here, business continues on
No longer works the corner cause he put some workers on
Living the life of love for love excitement
Til 5-0 hit that ass with his first sealed indictment
That's how they do, they want you to think that you're fooling them
But you're only fooling you
Now he's locked down and his life is on hold
All because of the first five jumbs that he sold
Was the 5-0, you know how that shit go

[Hook]

(Put that gun down
For your black self
The white man will give you a gun
But he knows you're not going to shoot him
Everyday we are sending each other to the hospital
Go to the Harlem hospital and see
How many of us we send in there on the weekend)

Word is bond, I hear you Minister Farrakhan
This is the situation that we're building on
Tears of sadness drowns the black nation
Cause black-on-black murder is the nineties situation
Gunshots ringing in the heat of the night
Mothers sitting home worrying if their seeds alright
Wondering if their son or daughter's gonna be the next one
Who's shot down by the devil's gun
Brothers can't you see the reason they promote that black-on-black
Cause they the enemy, using tricknology
Killing each other over jealousy or just to get a name quick
Yo now that's that bullshit
But when you show love for your people
Niggas look at you like you're smoking crack
They favorite line is "Yo, fuck that it's 'bout the money, black"
But we can get all that
If we stop sticking the knives in each other's back
Cause if we don't back we're sending each of us back
And you know you can't spend loot under dirt, black
That's why I help as many brothers as you can you see
Cause what comes around goes back around, are you with me
(Put that gun down)
Give a brother a pound and unite so lost and found can travel like sound
You see my duty is to civilize those who been victimized
Looked into the devil's eyes and don't realize
I come to free the dumb, cause if we're not free then we're dumb
So here the God come, pa rum pum pum pum

(We are killing ourselves
Why are we doing this?
Because the family has no love for one another
Black family, let's get it together
Black family, let's love each other
Black family, let's do good by one another
And never let it be said again)[Sample]

Darling
Ya know, you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention, you take my paycheck
Now baby, but I give it to you because I love you
Ya know cuz the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know, like runnin' my car into telephone poles
Plus (?) I didn't get mad did I?
Y-Y-y'member, 'member when
W-W-When I tried to take my clothes to the cleaners
And on the way out
My very best pinstripe caught a nail
I didn't get mad
I was proud because you thought, enough of your man
To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand, yes it did
Uuh I need you, I just need you

[Verse 1]
Uh
You know I was your bread, your butter
And I ain't talkin bout that bread I fucked up on you
Cause in my head man I swore I lucked up
Wasn't countin all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now, why would I play you bitch I made you
I'm not talkin bout the things that I gave you
Clothes wit the labels, I brought you round Hov and the label
Spring water while holdin you're age koo
Naw I ain't tryin to degrade you
But you was a lost little girl n you're world boo I saved you
Ya pop owe me a favor, I basically raised you
From squada to Bentley-whippin
Ain't have to watch Cribs to see how I was livin
Me, so blinded ain't see the Robin Givens in you
Huh, shoulda seen the Ginger in you
Tried to off Beans like Rothstein? Go figure
Youu take my dough, spend wit the next nigga you crazy bitch?

(Chorus #1)
And dis was the one I trusted
Who would ever think she would spread like mustard
Bitch I was your bread and butter
You shoulda tucked dat bread and butter
Ya know what?... Dis shit funny to me
It ain't nuttin but money to me
You lookin hungry to me
But I was your bread and butter
Bitch shoulda tucked dat bread and butter
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

[Verse 2]
You got the whole town laughin at me, silly he
Silly to see got me feelin silly like Denise like
Oh what could it be in you, I see
N dis young P-Y-T
She got me L-O-V, E-T-K-O'd
Uh, like Teddy P. whatever she say goes
But I'm, ready to +Turn Off The Lights+
Close the door, on my pretty young mi amor
Now peep game wit 'em, need, I, more
Gimme dat, E thy or
No Beanie Mac don't play dat crap wit these whores
She want me missin her (in my room) like the O'Jays homes
But I'm on to my zone like O.J. Jones
Beano brown, cancel dis bitch, I'll buy another one
It's my world you lil squirrel tryna get a nut bitch
Do you- what bitch? Lil smut bitch
Got you're name ringin, spreadin like mustard
And I'm supposed to trust it after he touched it?

(Chorus #2)
I told dat ass +slow down+ like Puba
Now your days are gray like the 4 pound Ruga
Bread and Butter, see I was you're bread and butter
Heyyy, baby ya hips is getting big
Now you getting thin you don't care about your whip
Cuz I was you're bread and butter
Shoulda tucked that bread and butter

(Bridge being sung)
So proud, of you.. a'ye-ah

When you do (do) What you do (do)
How do you know, What you know
Aw, shame on you
I need you (oh oh)
Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm

[Verse 3 - Grand Puba]
Yeah
Now you know I was your bread and butter
You had a shot to be my baby mother
Ain't no sorry I ain't Rueben Studdard
I can't apologize, it's multi-platinum time
Takin all my shit and sendin you back to you're moms cryin
So don't cry baby dry, ya eyes
You tried to get all greasy like you super-size fries
So, pack ya shit

It's been nice but listen ma I gotta defrost ya ice
Dats rite

(Chorus #2)

(Bread and Butter 4x)

*Mm Mm said repeatedly til fade to end*[Intro (Spoken): Heavy D]
This one definitely goes out on the censorship tip, so everybody sit back, relax and have a champagne sip
We're gonna teach these people out there that we can say what we want to say, the right way
You know what I'm saying? So what we're gonna do is kick back, swing a little funky beat by my man DJ Pete Rock, producer extraordinaire. Yo Pete Rock! Make it clear

[Verse 1: Heavy D]
I can flex, bend, lend a pen to a friend
Keep a party pimping from now till then
I don't have to swear, curse or juggle
Lyrics in a verse to make a party bubble
So mister censorship, tell me what's your problem?
There's girlies on the corner, if wifey can't solve them
How does she say it? I'm curious, G
Does she say "honey love me" or "baby baby fffffun me?"
Anyway, we'll say what we want to say
Play how we want to play, feels good that way
So G. Rap, huh, it's time to kick a verse
Do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 2: Kool G. Rap]
You're telling me don't curse on my verse
I did it worse, first I put a curse on every verse
I kinda got outrageous
Check it, even made a record how I'm doing all the B-I-T-C-H'es
Ducks, it wasn't for the bucks
Every word that you heard is 'cuz I didn't give a f-- aww shucks!
Hey yo, I almost forgot
The curse is a plot but it's getting kind of hot
So I'mma let profanity retire
Hey, but if worse comes to worse I'll curse you out like Richard Pryor
So Grand Puba, kick a verse
But do your man a favor, and don't curse

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
I won't curse. I'll take a famous curse word and just say "kcuf"
Kcuf flipped around the other way means, huh?
Boy, when I do it, see I can't get stuck
Jump on the mic, then I earn a quick buck
Buck meaning loot, then I grab some boots and step with my troops
For those who can't follow and got stuck
Kcuf flipped the other way means . . . [coughing]
Is this a curse? I freaked a nurse in a hearse
But I made sure I had my hat first
(C.L. Smooth) It's time to kick a verse
God-Cypher-Divine, we can't curse

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Go ahead, ask me will I kick a curse in a verse? I'll say "nope"
Grab you by your hair, wash your mouth out with soap
Thinking to be the last one with the bad lingo
Scooping on the skins in the church playing Bingo
Sounds of the Mecca don, fresh from the tailor
Because they made a movie when he cussed like a sailor
Better yet dialect dirty like a subway
Freak a funky loop and I make it go the other way
In a vocabulary scrimmage
But cursing in my village ain't good for my image
So Big Daddy, you know it's time to kick a verse
But do your man a favor: don't curse

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Uhh, the smooth rap inventor that enter
Parental discretion's not advised so there's no need to censor
Kids want to peep it, but you want to beep it, what?
I feel like slapping that sticker on your (Chill, chill, say butt!)
I'm too magical, rhymes are too tragical
For any source to stop Kane from getting capital
If I thought sticking me was dissing me, man, don't you know that this would be
Worse than Stephen King's Misery?
So clean all profanity, still and yet all the man'll be
Rocking any microphone you're handing me
So Heavy D, I'm about to disperse
Kick another verse, and don't forget not to curse!

[Interlude (Spoken): Heavy D]
Hey yo Big Daddy, check this out. I'm about to do some old sly, slick, smooth on the trick tip stuff
I'm gonna bring my little cousin, the producer of this joint, his name is DJ Pete Rock, definitely part of one of the family, you know what I'm saying, G?
He's about to flex on this here mic and get busy like his big cousin, you know what I'm saying? Check it
Pete Rock, kick a verse but don't curse!

[Verse 6: Pete Rock]
God bless, but I can't mess
Around with the curses, so I'mma kick verses
Or a verse, Soul Brother number 1 here to kick facts
Smoke the microphone and produce crazy tracks
Yo I'm a bad bro, let's start the flow
I'mma kick rhymes till it's time for me to go
I can't curse 'cuz Heavy D said so
Now I'mma get back to the subject, get wreck
If you think I'm bluffing just check
With the crew, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, very down to earth
And we didn't have to curse

[Interlude (Spoken): Q-Tip]
Yeah man, the Abstract Poet, Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest here to wreck!
You know what I'm saying, got my man Pete Rock and my man D in the house
And we're definitely chilling on the lifted tip
So bust the spit out

[Verse 7: Q-Tip]
Flim-flam-flim, lick my big black stuff
Must I kick a curse to be rough enough?
You can put the sticker where the sun don't shine
So back off and let me get mine!
Visions in my head when it's dealing with hits
If I have four girls, then I lick eight [its]
Wait--don't want to hear no drama
Cause the bum-diddly-Hev is a fave of my mama's
So I blew out and get mad lifted
Don't have to say [kcuf] to show that I'm gifted
God bless me 'cuz I reached my twenty-first
Hev D! Don't drop a curse

[Verse 8: Heavy D]
Peace, peace. Peace to the preacher
I'm talking about a verse without a curse, that's how I reach ya
I can rock a party without a swear or a harsh verb
Backwards, no curse words Heavy D prefers
So swing, swing to the silky clean rhythm
Before I say goodbye let me tell you how I hit 'em:
C.L., Pete Rock, G. Rap, Maxwell
Big Daddy, Q-Tip and, uh, me as well
Time to say peace, thank Pete for the beats
This funky beat was made for the streets
Notice how clean that we kept every verse
But if worse came to worse (we'd have all said a curse!)

[Outro]
Free Slick Rick! [repeated to fade-out]Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker
(Right on, right on, right on) Who is it?
Well it's Grand Puba honey
With my man Stud Doogie love
Droppin' 2000, dig the way this go down
Check it

[Verse 1]
I hit a flow all dipped in lotion
Sit back and sip moe as I'm countin' my doe
Grand Puba macks well, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honies know cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then its all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie
And dance body to body
Step one: first you grab honey by the waist
Step two: then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three: then ya look her dead in the face
Step four: now its time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teasa's, the one who wants the money and the visa's
I'mma tell honies straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, Dig it
This ones designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

[Hook]
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya and ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh yeah I lke it
And ya say ( I like it)

[Verse 2]
Could it be I've stayed away too long
Seems MC's be wishing I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star
Its only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
Its no doubt I come real with that
The butter track
The one that makes the honeis hit the bed mat
Im energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe, cause when it comes to gettin' down
I'm gettin' looser than a crackheads hair weave
And I, bet ya my dolly, while ya never find another style like this
If ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba ingnite your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
But I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears,tears; dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit'em with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb baby
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

[Hook]
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
And ya say New York City
Ooooh, yeah I like it (no doubt)
And ya say New York City
Ooooh, yeah I like it
Ha ha, and ya say
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Ninety-five flav, and I'm out
(Oooh, yeah I like it)
(Oooh, yeah. . . . . I like it)Intro: Grand Puba

Uhh, uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, come on, check it out, check it out, what?
Brand Nubian      "I'm black and I'm proud"
Uh, like that, like that, what?  "Say it loud"  "I'm black and I'm proud"
Come on, come on, come on, come on  "Say it loud"

Verse One: Sadat X

We made men in this world, digging for bones
The untraceable ones come with no clones
100 years from now y'all can still get this bomb
On the Brand Nubian dot com
My name should be mentioned with the Portier, not the Gualtier
Although it smell good, I still get mad at Rosewood
A Nubian card member since that faithful December
In the 80 years, from tears to cheers, things we did should be listed in a
Pyramid, studied by a little kid
Talked about by old jacks with slacks
Can I move the black is my first and foremost
Can I get a little land for me and mine?
Grow vegetables, maybe make a little wine
Build with the Gods and the bright sunshine
Before we save others we gotta save our own kind

Chorus:  *variations with Jamar and Puba's shoutouts*

"I'm black and I'm proud"   "Say it loud"    "I'm black and I'm proud"
"Say it loud"  "I'm black and I'm proud"  "Say it loud"   "I'm black and
I'm proud"
"Say it loud"

Verse Two: Lord Jamar

Now did you know it was you who was first to walk the Earth
Gave birth to the Universe, uh
Afflicted with the curse of the slave
Predicted to inherit the earth in the last days
Now as we take you home, what we make our own
It's written in stone like Commandments
Read them every now and then or when you get the chance
Catch a glance through the power lens, see if you could see us advance
G-O-D in the dance, reporting freelance
Fought for a chance, got you hanging by the seat of your pants
Our immediate stance when we came to the game
Was completely advanced so no one sounds the same
7 and one-half ounces of brain
When we around make sure you bow down to the king
Brand Nubian style is how we do our thing
So if you feel good, real good
Scream it out loud if you black and you proud

Chorus

Verse Three: Grand Puba

Feel me now, check my style
A brother's resume run longer than the Nile
Justice cipher born to teach man, woman and child
In the land of the lost where my people went foul
Do the knowledge, black, look at the way that we act
Smoking crack or each other with the gat
The only race of people who kill self like that
I deal with actual facts to keep my mind on track
I love y'all that's why I say these things
Watch me transform chickenheads to queens
Rhymes full of protein like rice and beans
Brand Nubian cats here to change all that
The maker, the owner, the cream of the Earth
Proud to be black because the black man's first
My flow frequency is at a million megahertz
So when I spit my verbals I'm heard around the Universe (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So don't front, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud

ChorusArtist: Marley Marl f/ Tragedy, King Tee, Grand Puba, Def Jef, Chubb Rock
Album: Marley Marl In Control Volume 2
Song: Keep Control

(Chorus)
Keep control...

(Tragedy the Intelligent Hoodlum)
When I made arrest the president, America ate me
Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me
They labeled me a prejudice poet
I'm speaking the truth as I know it
I hold on but it's hard for me to handle
Too much lies, corruption and scandal
Cops want to kill a brother or two
Who do you call when the gang wears blue
I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man
My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger
I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer
Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor
Mali troops will run through your resident
In my hand will be the head of your president
All you fess that made a check to throwdown
Will rise up for a political showdown

Chorus

(King Tee)
Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip
Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip
Of the ropes and chains that kept us
Since we were black they didn't want to except us
But it's ok, I got my own plan
Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program
The natives cook, wash and clean
And to the rubbers that throw in the scene
M-A-N-D-E-L-A
Now you got a chance to hear what he say
Since they kept him locked up for so long
Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong
But we need to all stand together though
And let the red, black and green show
Become aware of yourself before it gets too late
Another message from King Tee the great

Chorus

(Grand Puba)
Yo bust it
Hung wit the flip, got a ?dooby? wig
Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man got zits
Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi
Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends
Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy
Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy
Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids
And the man caught a nice thick bitch
Now the bitch is on skid
Screaming how she hates her kids
The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy
Think slick, she better get wit the wick
Cause foul, foul, foul is your style
You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile
See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song
How long must this go on

Chorus

(Def Jef)
Power now or never, together forever
And ever, sever make it endever
To enlight your brother when
I recommend to extend a hand
Expand it then wish strength to fend
Black women and men from the white power structure
They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya
And you gave birth to a nation
You freelabel laid America's economic foundation
Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years
But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears
The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables
Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels
And years of classroom fables, fiction
Fallacies all sorts and fabrications
?For sarge? even fuss
Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts

Chorus

(Chubb Rock)
I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen
And knowing his father slowing
And his mother is hoeing
And now should he be growing
He's too young to be sewing
He should just chill and be flowing
I know he was being malested and sold
And his mom for being infected
Never check it, so I invested
My time and made sure little bro was looked at
Pops got evicted, not a smack
Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless?
The bum got done by the one
And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip
Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip
It confuses and bent ill thoughts
In the soul of the youngster
Is daddy a monster
That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain
Drys and open your eyes for the insane

Chorus"Check it out ch'all and you don't stop. Keep on and you don't stop" (x4)

Verse 1:
I knew from jump that my shit was gonna hit
Cause I spoke to Dione Warick and she put me on some psychic shit
She said becareful cause these girls be throwin' block
I said D don't even worry I sweat no girl for they stank box
I like drinkin' honey hit me a 5-1-6

Girl:
What's a 5-1-6?

Puba:
Long Island you dumb bitch
When it comes to this my style flows Free like Willy
Watch me grab the cream like them Beverly Hill Billy
I know you're happy with the shit you just bought
It's the greatest return since Jordan hit the court
Because my style changes frequently
See I been shit talkin' mics since the days of delenquency
Now I'm still the same low down gold teeth and Gortex
And on occassion with the ruff sex
Stud Doogie heats it up like a flannel
Cause he's smooth as wall panel
Hits the one and two like a freebee channel
I have no time for bullshitters I get bad honies jitters
As I walk be all the chickenhead critters
I got more funk then En Vogue got junk in they trunk
My flow hits ya like a filty piece of skunk
So Alley get the scomma fromt he dodge spot
Put it in the L and get high like an astronaut

Hook

Verse 2:
Now see they call me Mr. Mingo
Got a girl but I'm still single
Honies scream my name (PUBA) like they just won bingo
I take 'em out for a dinner or a show but you know how the rest go
Hey man no doe
You know the type you go out a few nights they sweat your pockets tight
Cause they rock they're rockers right
Go away little girl you gets nothing
But here take a Bufferin to ease your pain and sufferin'
Cause I'm so aware of too many things
I know what I know if ya know what I mean
Come clean because I'm a fiend for a beat and a theme
Comin' strong like Hakeem and it ain't a dream
Now is it me or is this hittin' like Tyson?
Like a plate of beans and rice I be a needy winds on ice and
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie on the nights I bag the dumb we hit a nut
And then we back up in her guts
See I get down and dirty like an arceologist
I get deep into your mind like a psycologist
I hit brothers in the head with the real
Bag honies like a charm cause Grand Puba is the bomb
So come on baby there's no need to play dumber
Or I be comin' around your nostrals when I cum
So check it out now...

Hook[Intro: Heavy D]
Yeah, this is, uh, an untouchable funk you know what I'm sayin'
This is for all the players and playettes, wherever you at you dig
I'm talkin' about from this side to that side
East side, west side, your side, my side
It's all about being funky. man

[Verse 1]
Ayo, give me that microphone
It's Heavy D the baritone and I'm home alone, dig it
And I'm always stayin' freshly dipped on 1-2-5th
Where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin' spliff
Okay, okay, okay, okay, it's Heavy D again
Hallelujah, I'm on your TV screen again
You see me on your MTV and on your BET
And on your local focal point video show
Nigga, this how it flow so fly like an eagle
No sequels, no weed, but I get love from all the thugs
Cause they still my people
I'm dynamic punks panic when they see me
They get all shook up when my mic's hooked up
Let's get it on

[Hook] (x2)
Untouchables at your door
(Let's get it on)
All you whack rappers hit the floor

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
How should I plead, forever thuggin' on a quest to get G's
Runnin' from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin'
Thinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' G's
They after a playa but I won't let 'em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and the nicotine
I can't sleep, close my eyes, I see wicked things
I keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger
Rollin' down the 405, beware of stangers
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it til I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me
Before the penitentiary
Let's get it on

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do
I have all the honeys sayin' "Go Pu'!"
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps
And sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin'
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walkin'
Niggas got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody wanna this
But them youth don't trouble we
Because they fall victim to what they see, hey
I keeps it "Reel To Reel", like my last album title song
But I understand, it takes a year for niggas to catch on
Hit 'em in the head dog, so let's get it on, yeah

[Bridge: Notorious B.I.G.]
Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to get wicked in the joint, uh, Notorious is glorious
*coughing*

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas know who's the mind blower, the weed grower
Have you seen doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower
B.I.G. top notch with the Glock check your pockets
And your sockets it's just the way my pops taught me
When you throw the drop check 'em throughly
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggas don't make no moves
When I'm slingin' in the hood I don't fake no moves, aight
Reminiscin' on my swinger days
When I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yeah, she had the Gucci roots I had Carducci Suits
Oshkosh-begosh, Coca-Cola, lookin' real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin' Bucktown
MAC-11 cocked back niggas better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it onAlright y'all!
I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on a brother
That's bound to lay more dips in your hips
More gliiiiide in your stride
And if you don't dig what's next
You got the wrong damn address

[Grand Puba - steadily getting louder]
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming (8X)

Bo! Lickshot for the blood claat
Talkin that what-not, Puba come and hit on the right spot
Rhyme teller for the ladies and the fellas
And I only kick the flavor for my fellow ghetto dwellers
No rock'n'roll, it's just soul
Ain't nuttin changed, I still like to hit the hole
With my pole, smoke a stog' and then I roll
And when my corn hurts I wear a Dr. Scholl
I make beats, then I hit sheets
Then I build with the Gods to get the addicts off the nod
Grand Puba, and I drop a album yearly
And I'm very nearly really come to droppin shit like daily
My knowledge is bond, so you brothers better move on
You brought your wack style, come play the horn
Grand Puba Maxwell, not on the Hollywood tip
Here comes a brother more than _2 Legit to Quit_
I'm not sleazy but I like it nice and easy
Ain't nuttin changed, I still wear my hair peasy
I like to dig it, that's how we done done dug it
I tend to work for all the ones who like to wig it

*samples cut and scratched by Alamo, including
"I got a story I want to tell you", "I like to tell it like it is"*

"Second time around"

[Grand Puba]
Check, I get boom service just like room service
And when I jump upon a stage I'm not a bit nervous
I kick the reel to rell, I never been to jail
Oops maybe one time but I had a good time
I keep my pants saggin, I'm never lolligaggin
Niggas try to copy this they on the bandwagon
I shake my thing I do I pull a hamstring and then I call a old fling
Gotta Spike her and tell her _Do the Right Thing_
Ron Stud'll do the rap, Alamo'll do the overdub
'Fore we hit these 40's G, we gotta get some grub
Grand Puba *inhales* Let me take a breather
Get you hot like a fever, you'll be slammin even
So don't bother, it's the new Godfather
Tell your godson that Grand Puba is the one

"Way back in, history, the Prodigal Son
Was a, wealthy man" (2X)

[Grand Puba]
Sing it baby, ha ha ha, bust it
No more skid row, can't get a show
Time to kick a new flow, and make the dough y'know?
I'm a Pisces I like to drink iced teas
I'm a Reese's with all the pieces
Or the Alomnd with the Joy, ten years from a boy
When I work out Puba go see Roy's
Next to thirty-three, where Stud lives
You won't catch the Puba doin nothin negative
Now honey don't like me cause I won't dance like Hammer
Honey ask Hammer, can he speak Puba's grammar?
I can shake a leg if I want to, but I don't want to
Cause that's what my dancers do
Now I give the next man his props
But when it comes to micraphones, c'mon, give me mine Hobbes
I won't diss the next brother to be paid that's not my trade
But every brother, ain't a brother, word to the mother
All praises to the father, you wanna try to see this
Don't even bother!
Grand Puba, for those who came late
You try to step to this, then I'll end up-state
Word is bond, let's move on and on and on
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Big up to my Now Rule brothers
All the cool ones, not the fool ones
And we gon' move it like this for the year ninety-two
Big up to my man, Positive K
Big up to my cousin Jeff
And allatha and allathat
This is how we gon' move this yo, word is bond
S.D., in the house
Definitely pumpin the shit like this
And this is how we gon' do it yo
Knowledge Knowledge

Ok we gonna straighten this shit out right now ok!
Hey I go by the name of the Kool the DJ Red Alert!
OK!!!!!!!!! I got a mean lineup

And it's goin down like thiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Verse 1: Cormega]
If you could dream it, you could be it
I once idolized a few guys I superseded
As you near, you hear Anita Baker playin in my BM
Indeed, I'm from the era of Patrick Ewing Adidas
The game turned public housing to areans
Bummy dudes move packs so they could buy jewels and sneakers
Money grew, some adapted, others would become distracted
Smokin woolies, openin they packs like Pookie
I'm a fiend of hip-hop, my rap is cinematic
The beat is the plot, I'm breed as a clock
G's like R-P, believe it or not
Prestige is an illusion
That it lose you, and you not hot..
You know how I do
My jewels so colorful, my daughter don't gotta watch cartoons
Dudes watch my moves, like Lebron fresh out of high school
My electrifyin skills unrivaled

[Verse 2: Parrish Smith from EPMD]
I'm an all star baby pa, Alot of dudes is lost in the rap game chasin life of the rap star
Not P, I paid my dues while you hate and snooze
P always come correct no singin the blues
Hip Hop's my life, P already paid the price
Give me the mic and the vocal booth and y'all could keep the ice
And I still run on the young ones like Jerry Rice
And if you can't see in the dark then homey turn on the lights
And if a sucker don't like P, the feelin is mutual
Tune my rhyme into a RPM then shift to neutral
Every move is crucial, catch PMD comin through the hood
In the new SUV, with the chrome shoes
From the L.I.E. TO QB
It's Mega and P two of the nicest reppin N.Y.C
Parrish Smith you know me well from EPMD
So You Gots To Chill cause niggas can't fuck me

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
Uh, you know I got the shine when it's time to get mine
Pop that ass with a classic-ass line (uh!)
You try to step to me, I'm worse than landmines
Twist yo' spine like spiral book rhymes
You wanna do this, you must be out yo' mind
Pop shut it down, so I'm one of a kind
Get mine, fall back and recline
If you look up, BAD MUH'FUCKER and that's me you gon' find
Grand Puba, I can never suck
That's like tryin to ride around with single-digit rim on the Caddy truck
Me in this addin up, all it equals
Is another hot joint that I spit wit my peoples
So, you know the deal, real recognize real
So throw yo' hands up, let me know how you feelS
Cause it's on now (it's on now), stack paper, like a green mile
Official authentic is Grand Puba style

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
Here we go KRS in the spot
When I spit it you can see that I am fresh they are not
This that other type of lyric when you hear it you stop
KRS and Cormega now that's some real hip hop
I'm glad to see these MC's comin up after me
Runnin up after me, doin it how it has to be
This that new shit but it's old
This that hot shit but it's cold
Three, four, five clips when we roll
Boom boom bop bip when you fold
B-R-O-N-X PAY THE TOLL
They standin next to the flesh I'm next to the soul
My history is too complex whenever it's told
One of a kind breakin the mold
Refine in the mind rebuilt in the soul
Health, love and awareness and wealth now that's the goal
Pass the pole of the microphone that you hold
I model my role with my pocket so swole
Don't have to be told twice, KRS and Cormega, yo them cats too nice (HA!!!)
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang!!!!
When it comes to lyrics yo them cats can't hang
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang
KRS And Cormega!!!!!

[Verse 5: Big Daddy Kane]
Aiyyo, back up and let a real Don through
To show you who this motherfuckin spot belong to
So many talkin like there's somethin that they wan' do
Shit, y'all niggas couldn't find the heart with John Q
I'm here to warn you, just might show off because
I could really +Clap+ and make the lights go +Off+
My Enterprise like Microsoft, the sweat and blood'll cool
Make cheddar double through, plus I'm ghetto lovable
Scheme to win by any means within
Shit, a nigga this here thorough won't be seen again
Cause when my, team is in and I got green to spend
Or I'mma hold the fort down just like supreme di-vine
Got you stuck behind enemy lines, the whole vicinity's mine
And he decline, nigga give me a sign
And you don't want ventilation all up out your house
Then treat my name like spoiled food, keep it out yo' mouth - nigga!

[Outro: Kool DJ Red Alert]
And there you have it, everybody!
Big up to everybody all across the border that understand REAL Hip Hop
REAL skills, REAL lyrics
I go by the name the Kool the DJ Red Alert
Hey - we ain't goin a GODDAMN place!
Hey, you must think we goin somewhere
Hey, you must be out yo' goddamn MIND
AND YA PUNK, TOO!
And for all you bitches, thank you for nothin
Yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!!!!Yeah...
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Grand Puba, Dattie X... dig it

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Get up out my way, it's Grand Pub's turn to shine
Hood MC's ride the pine and get paid no nevermind
One time as I sew it up like Dr. Frankenstein
Chickens ride the pony cause the rhyme flow genuine
As I do it like that, do it like this
Shorty watch your step or you might get Rocked like Chris
Are you feelin this? You dig the way it's going down?
Now we back in town watch all the chickens crowd around
Niggas try to duplicate my flow but it's difficult
Like a game of Yahtzee
Chickens stress me out like paparazzi
As I flip a flow you desire
Dattie blaze those trees and let's start this forest fire
My rhymes carry like the weight on Barry
Stack cheddar like Combs and buy homes like Larry
I be smoother than Tal, Sharp-ton like Al
When you ballin everybody want to be your pal
No dilly-dally, baggin up the shorter alley
Bouncin in German cars, still playin shot-ball
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you
For sure dog cause this is how we do

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
Ah shit, I see I'm in the mix
Watch the green van cause inside's the dicks
The prayer beads bleeds from the crucifix
Went tight comin out boy I be down in six
Or when the sun go down, or when it's round in the BX
Cats on the concourse, still call me DX
Bums on the street often ask me for change
What's change when I'm tryin to save up for the Range?
I want the whole world and my old girl back
Change that -- I want half the world, and fuck my old girl
You can play the hell out, like those that came before ya
Your style is butt, similar to a cobra
That's your pimp strut
But what you foes is really doin
Is leaving your empire in ruins
I'm the problem solver
I got the brand new revolver
But I got a new album too
I want to be here for that money and the rest of my crew
Y'all know it too -- a nigga like me is due

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Verse 3: Puba]
Now you know I gots to come back strong
See I been doing this too goddamned long
For me to ever try to come back wrong
Check my pockets and my empty light just came on
Don't wanna do wrong so I think I'm best to make this song
Undeniably satisfiably master microphone mutilator
None greater, ain't no Automator
Grand Puba and Dattie, riding shotty in the Mazarati
As we come and blaze you niggas body

[Verse 4: Sadat]
Corner poets get smacked and hit, savagely bit
I go git and then you out of it, permission to quit
I mean right, I keep the green light specials
Half price a slice, you blink twice
I done picked up the dice
I'm that nice, Dattie X the party-starter
Number one heart-ripper-aparter
More vice and gambling than Las Vegas, Nevada
I try harder every day
It's all work and no play

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)
