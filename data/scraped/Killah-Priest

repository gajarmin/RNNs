[Intro] x3
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

[Hook: Killah Priest] x2
Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Knowledge is wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying plus the praying
I didn't like staying cause of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs
During the service he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men
Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia or the abyss
With no trace of trivia left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and embroid it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation - the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

The basic instructions before leaving earth

[Hook] x4 to fade[Intro: LP version only]
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death

[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]
The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cos I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse Three: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions

[Verse Four: The Genius/GZA]
The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused[Hook]
Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first

The basic instructions before leaving earth
[Hook][Intro: Judge (Lawyer) {Woman}]
{They killed my baby, oh God they killed my baby}
Order in the court, order in the court
{I will make you pay for this you murderers}
[I said order in the court now
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
(Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen]

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't tryna hear it
Buck buck buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit

[Break: Judge (Poetic)]
(Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream)
Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?]

[Verse 2: RZA]
The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil jinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

[Break: Judge (jury)]
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
Calm down people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation ]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ahhh!!)

[Verse 4: Frukwan]
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some moreand watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz

[Outro: Judge]
Guilty, next case[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I built with Alexander the Great
He told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue, where it is
Men feared time, yet time feared the pyramids
He gave me more jewels, he told me that
Amenhotep was immortal, I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest, and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and Muwali rings
And your whole team Judas, my road thin, gold skin like Zeus'
I speak the dialog of the dead, I practiced the same war tactics
In King Arthur's head, so let the swordsmen kill the beast
It's a Legacy of Blood, with Vinnie Paz and Killah Priest

[Hook: Stoupe cuts up samples]
"The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness"
"Elements burst and gave birth to the worst
Took the pen from the nurse, and hold the mic up first"
"Put your rhymes, the rhymes, put your rhymes on the alter
Burn them as a sacrifice"

[Killah Priest]
I paint flows with the feathers from the wings of angels
Red ink from saint blood, nigga, you ain't thug
Stare into the face of a king's mug
Crush grape, feel the wine jug, ill thoughts
Build from the mind of rhyme, rose off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this, for the clueless
I'm Shakespearean, with gray earrings
Speak like Tiberians, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharaoh
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now known as the Dead Street Apostle
We shoot 'em Feds, use them hollows
Bullets spread, til they meet Diablo
Stars in enlightment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates, where you can't breath
Stay high off that dead weed, in the mind is where I plant seeds
To grow fruit, of king's so brute, of army troops
Mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite vision, stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take, more than one scoop
It's Priesthood

[Hook: Stouple cuts up samples]
"Straight up, we serve justice
So if they can't be trusted, may you return where the dust is"
"Put your rhymes, the rhymes, Put your rhymes on the alter
Burn them as a sacrifice"
"Elements burst and gave birth to the worst
Took the pen from the nurse, and hold the mic up first"
"Put your rhymes, the rhymes, Put your rhymes on the alter
Burn them as a sacrifice"

[Vinnie Paz]
I studied element 1-15, with the Elohim
Saw the Canaanites, Sumerians, and the Philistines
This is street gospel, if you don't believe
In life at Mars, that mean the beast got you
You don't wanna see me and Killah Priest hostile
You don't wanna see, desert eag' heat pop you
This is Mothman Prophecy, walk back
To the sand of Iraq, and let the prophet breath
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk in war with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shoot the beast, with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep, to be a strong Pharaoh
It's a war when the God's spit
It's Allah, when I split the icebergs in the Arctic
I don't care what the cause is
And I'mma ride for my fam, no matter what the cost is

[Outro: Vinnie Paz *Stoupe cuts samples to end*]
Yeah, Vinnie Paz, Killah Priest, yea
Priesthood, Maccabeez, yeah, Army of Pharoah
Aight? Yeah[GZA]
On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bulk
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave

[Hook: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fates erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

[Killah Priest]
Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, "I'm black and comely"
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail

[Hook]

[Outro: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surfaceNow number two, practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit
He had the speed of a snake

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Niggas is like serpents out there
[Snake style, no one could compete]
Serpents will bite
Lay outside, and then they roll back into they holes
They slither, in the streets of Brooklyn, New York
Slither in the streets, of Manhattan
In the streets of Queens, streets of the Bronx
Streets of Staten Island
Wherever you see em they slither
Whoever... yo
Fearsome shit... check it out
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
It broke me up when they pat me on my shoulder
Said stay strong cuz his life is now over
I flash back to the heathens that he roll with
They shot him up and down nobody knows shit
My peers, little ears
Came up to me with a eye full of tears
Last night we was shootin dice and gettin nice
Kid rolled us, played us for our merchandise
We were in the hallway all day
Me, Steve, and Little Ray
Probably at first they tried to rob me
Back me in the lobby, pull out the shotty
Then came Scotty, fragile body
My first impression, he returned from a party
He would just stagger, smellin like Bacardi
The Dragon, braggin, how he was fuckin mad hotties
Pressed on the elevator button, then all of a sudden
He licked off, about a dozen
Slugs from the cannon, that ripped through my cousin
Nobody was standing when the nigga started bustin
Blood started to flood the floors by the elevator doors
That's the last thing that I saw
Damn, we planned to make grands of our own

[Number two]

[Verse 2: RZA]
Jagged edge, rockin God, hard as Stonehenge
Pledged whoever crossed his path get scrapped with a sledge..
..hammer, he didn't give a damn about the manner
And on the block he was called by the momma's and the grandma's
Indecent, heathen, juvenile delinquent
His weekends was frequently, locked inside the precinct
His most recent cape for catchin papes
Was snatchin up snakes on a roof butt-naked hang em off like drapes
Then ask what's the combination to the safe, with the brace
And those who didn't reply they fell straight to their face
Razor blade sharp who invades the dark
And raid more spots than Spays and NARCS iron heart like Tony Starks
A fierce lion, who never leave the crib without the iron
And on the block he be slingin rocks and duckin from the sirens
Greetin niggas he loved with a pound, and a bear hug
Those who wanted life, they catch a slug from the snub
A Five Percent, who all knew was one to ten
He loved the Gods with his heart but his brain was filled with sin
And when he came through niggas be lookin out
Hopin he gets shot or tooken out, or locked the fuck up in Brooklyn House
In PC, on a liquid diet, but he was louder than a riot
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Do the knowledge to a nigga named Trigga
Bad rude boy from the land of Jamaica
With visions to venture, to the U.S
To receive the gold that he couldn't acheive
In his country, even though he sold mad weed
For the next man, who was the Don of the clan
Niggas actin like they got the block locked
Like I can't sling drug raps and eat food
But I be the rudest, bad boy steppin gun totin
Shots lash out like a violent explosion
At the nigga, who tries to stop my production
Intervene the scene and slow up the cream
None of that black, East New York, gun talk
Niggas I extort from Baltic to Boardwalk
Memories of injuries wounds and burns
Walkin' through the streets of Medina I stand firm
Cause I know this, which means I can hold mine down
Without a doubt, niggas who front, get snuffed out
Justice must be born there's no escape
Cause a snake can't be reformed so I wait
Comin' in the name to proclaim your fame for protection
And you don't know no fuckin' lessons?
[Number two, the snake]

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Bad, bad, Leroy Brown
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Badder than the deep blue seaaaaa
Badder than you and meeeeee
Niggas comin thru the trees, like a salamander, bitin'
Like a piranha, but I'm bitin' you back, like a black pantha
The style I'm ampin' the... fuck my name, who I be?
Fuck the game, it's all about the moneyyyy!
Owahhaerahh, sometimes I get high with the Meth
Then I turn to the Killah Priest
When it comes TWELVE O'CLOCK!!
I turn into the demon beast, yo
Yo fuck that shit!
[Number two, the snake]
YO! SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKERS WHAT TIME IT IS
[Number two, the snake] Rawwrarrrah
Rahhwarwaahauh, rawwaroar!!
WHO's THE BAD-ASS? *rawharrah*
WHO's THE BAD-ASS?
[Now number two] Rawwwaahrah
[He practiced the snake style
He was known as the snake spirit] YEAHhhhhh

[Verse 5: Buddah Monk]
Lyrics, never waitin, twelve days, penetrated
When I come with the ruffness, mad niggas try to rush this
Slip into my killings, then I slays and you're helpless
When I try to stay sick, it's yacub grafted six
Calm for the kill, knowing the style that's ill
When I drop, lyric skills, brothers say, Buddah chill!!

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I don't need to rhyme no more, niggas know, yo!
To all the Wu-Tang Clan members
The Ghostface Killer, the GZA, the RZA, the Ol' Dirty Bastard
The Method Man, the Chef - Raekwon, Inspector Deck, U-God
Yo!!![Verse 1: GZA]
Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound

[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor

[Verse 4: Njeri Earth]
I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind[Intro: LP version only]
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death

[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]
The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cos I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse Three: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions

[Verse Four: The Genius/GZA]
The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused[Verse 1: KRS One]
We hit 'em and get 'em
We stick 'em and jig 'em
We pick 'em and kick 'em
Flippin' them whip and
I'm wing clippin' them lip cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and
My tribe be on a quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in 'em
Splittin' and strippin' 'em down while spittin' a round
Into them soundclash see winnin' them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' 'em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, others be stealin'them

[Verse 2: Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to fuck with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go
Let's see if you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This show is real, this is the deal, guns I'm running
Gotta make it out of town to flip my shit and keep it coming
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night
With a bunch of niggas and two mics
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my nigga Biggie

[Verse 4: Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the niggas and the bitches stay paid, fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a bitch
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the niggas from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get niggas from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo, this is for my niggas on the block all day
Who don't give a fuck waiting for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo, we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best niggas that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
Niggas coming through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Coming deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Verse 5: Cam'Ron]
We destroy niggas, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Making about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type
You need a dyke, babygirl, I see the light
But sometimes y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

[Verse 6: Bounty Killer]
?????????????????????

[Verse 7: Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leaving one-third damaged
With your back cracked the Earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the Earth of the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasing motherfuckers through malls, and clash in halls
Beating motherfuckers through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin down elevator shafts
Searchin for they ass, stayin low in the grass
Wearing a gas mask, wrapping their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin mad
What? Yeah yeah, sooooooooooooo

[Verse 8: Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with your hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her ass back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, nigga what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at

[Verse 9: Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, eEnglish, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you fuck you and that bitch on your bike
Brick City

[Verse 10: Reverand Run]
Ayo, now bust it
Never try me crimey, I'm grimy, so don't deny me
I be little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(Now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that nigga
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

[Outro: All]
The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hot[Killah Priest]
Y'all niggas thought that I quit the game?
Thought you seen the Stonehenge tomb stone
Inscript my name; thought you saw all of the Ice wit Cube
Nah I'm equipped wit flames, mummified in Gucci
I live again, abominated my body wit all y'all hate
[*Abominated my body wit all y'all hate*]
Dress me in a suit of negative thoughts of all the fake
The caretaker places a smile on my face
Then threw me in the pit, that's it
He made his glory, in 98 but now it's 840
He gave his story, but above his grave it was stormy
Which made the dirt to kick muddy
It's about to get ugly, trust me
Thirteenth day, unlucky, fuck me, nah FUCK YOU!!!
Dust move from off his cloth
He begins to cough then begins to talk
I am rough, 840 Babylon
Then he smatch his palms thru the coffin
The comin' of his 2nd Offering
There was no death so there is no mournin'
[*There is no death so there is no mournin'*]
His 2nd Stained Glass see his hand pushin' thru the grass
Yeah, see the sand slippin' thru the glass
The Reaper held a sickle for that ass
I prepared you a plate of violence
The quiet surround ya grave wit vio-lins
Be afraid of goblins
To resurrect again is my greatest challenge
Before I fell, I cast you in Angels in the hell
His skull is fire, his horse is pale
In the soul of this writer, his force is a dwell
I'm the abomination you're facin'
My rhymes conjure Satan, in an armor of caveman's
The final conflict we're waitin'
And my palm grips the ink wavin'
Inside me is fiery, hundred eyes of the P
I'mma split altar inside of a broken tabernacles of slaughter
The threshold for dead souls
I finish ruins of castles in the Soviet Union
Y'all love death, y'all married my anger
Y'all played Russian roulette
Y'all souls is the wager
Who wanted, I'm comin' for all y'all
And after I kill ya, I'mma walk thru the graveyard
Wit a shovel like the Devil
Dig up your skeleton and grind it till there's more evidence
Then take your powder to my residence
Open up a dutch, sprinkle the dust
Then light the shit up
And take a gigantic mothafuckin' puff
[*And take a gigantic mothafuckin' puff*](Priest talking)
Yeah, yeah, my name is Priest
You know what it is man
Here me out there world
What you got on this man?
Big time we gotta get it
What's over there? I go it
Lock that, Priesthood, knaw'mean?
It's real son, it's real son

(Hook) Priest
I only fucks - with - what's - real

[Killah Priest]
Let he who have sin, sin no more
Tired of kicking in doors, shootouts,, blood and gang wars
Chainsaws, tied up spouses, cocaine laws
Hawaiian outfits with SKs that bloodstain walls
Till you're losing ounces, niggas see the life that drug game calls
You're crying fountains on the calls, saying, "Please, she's only four"
Pleading the merciless men that murder your kin
Sending you threats over the phone and they murder again
Now you either make the payments or funeral arrangement
Contemplating, federal building put their name in a statement
Poor choices, take this like the gem from the pearl of oysters
Still wet on my tongue, rep where you're from
And your boy just see real niggas respected
Deliver this message to the dumb and the deceased
We all from the streets, made they rest in peace
While I wreck this beat with techniques
Resurrect speech with flows are deep in soul
I tell Ms. Rahman, I'm sorry what happened that evening
But it was Tone; his name came up now we even
And Mr. James I wish I could change, but Todd
Shouldn't of did what he did, you can't blame Rob
And Ms. Stevens, what can I say? A close call
But it wasn't me you visit at the morgue
When they killed Spark that night, my heart went to the right
My chest got tight, that was a hard one to fight
Hood mysteries that no one could figure out
Plain and simple, facts were there
Going through packs of beer
Make me run to the roof; let the Mac off in the air
You was always strapped, gave me dap then threw up the pairs
Like yeah, I missed those years, I dish out tears
Strange dreams at night make me wish you was here
Tommy you should have watched your back
Instead he let them niggas plot and then form an attack
His shots echo, bounced off the building in the ghetto
Mass genocide, inner-city children of the borough
And Mr. John, I did what I did cause of revolution
You're damn near sixty, may you lay next to Newton
The dollar bill, "In God We Trust"
Does God stand for Guns, Oil, & Drugs they gave to us?

(Hook) Priest

[Killah Priest]
Its project living regardless revolvers are spitting
When drama is lit, ganja get clipped, the mission
No bottles with ribbons, just hollows from Henchmen
Hell swallows us, death follows up
Bullet shells, toddlers get bucked
Black male role models are fucked
The little girls promised the world but tomorrow turn sluts
You either playing basketball or pushing crack in the hall
Or either rap or getting macs out the board
Now what's that, white supremacists?
No rights for immigrants (no rights)
Life imprisonment, some get life sentences
Secret indict, wife swapping with businessmen
We fight militant, deep as the words they're writing Genesis
Black paintist Rome-like the images
This goes to the judges and the sentences

(Hook) Priest[Intro: Killah Priest]
First time in rap history
Your mind will be tooken to a level
Prepare yourself

[Killah Priest]
When I relax my thoughts and my brain hovers New York
My third eye glides with the view like a hawk
They find my mind is automatic, rhymes are tragic
Found in the attic, lost you in Asia
Minor, find you in a laser beam
I'm supreme, my mind state is like a dream
Stargazer scarred from the radar
Beyond Gods and moms and airwaves and channels
Desert rats and camels, reptiles and mammals
Standings of Daniel, Emmanuel and Samuel
Ezekiel's wheel over tall trees and hills and mountains
Fountains, rivers, lakes, brooks and ponds
Inhabit by rabbits, snakes and swans
Energy is solar light barrelled beyond the Sun Controller
Over Jehovah through the days of Noah
Tremendous speed around the Octaman sea
Black Sea, Sea of Caspian
Persian Gulf all the way to Mediterranean
City of Atlantis, skin is getting tight as a mantis
Priest style is organic, mechanic seagulls, swings over the eagles
Soars over cathedrals built during the medieval
Shall remain in the ordained Byzantine Empire
Take you higher one stage as a massive fire
But still like Niger, arch rival of Constantine
Dark Ages got sparked through the stages
307 A.D. Constantinople ruled mobile
Seeking global floating motion over the Arctic Oceans
Scan the land, every inch of the sand
Never bring plans, animals, woman, child and man
Beasts and fish every inch, length and width
Come through the abyss over Egypt
A space odyssey with more angles than photography
More exotic plus it's erotic like pornography

[Break: Killah Priest]
Am I almost there?
Yeah I'm almost there?
Am I almost there?
Yeah I'm almost there?
Am I almost there?

[Killah Priest]
I'm a space cadet from a tape in the cassette player
By fasting and prayer, I'm passing the ozone layer
I meditate then I'm near top of skyscrapers
View fluid nature, dropping, blew through a vapour
Then there's paper, the wind that take you
Quiet as the breath in your nose
Appear in the cold from the depths of our soul
Which has no weight, constants rotate at a slow rate
Through the black holes over rainbows in Kuwait
Destination, operation, alternation of the Sun
Circuit stars, positions seasons, I weigh a tonne
Immortality through galaxies I'm burning
It's like accomplished, plus the compass keeps turning
Pure as a virgin, release heavy burden
I travel when I preheated the urban
Hit the firmament, shockwaves are permanent
Rays of children gaze and stand amazed
So long, I'm going to the place Paul Apostle was born
Which is in Tarsus, small city in Cilicia
Then I moved south, all the way to Nigeria
Row the Tigris River all the way to Assyria
Mesopotamia all the way to Syria
Euphrates to the Ur of Chaldees
Up the Highland located near Iran
Further crescent till I reach a section
From each direction, from East to West and
From North to South, all over the equator
Neptune from the womb of the creator
Killah Priest the Iron Sheik from the Middle East
I'm 'Almost There' so prepare, I say peace... peace...[Intro: Killah Priest, Raekwon]
Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die

[Raekwon]
I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy
You getting high right? Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you

[Hook: Raekwon]
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real

[Verse 2: RZA]
My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles
So he put popsicles on her nipples to make her sex passion
Triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade

[Hook]
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real

[Verse 3: Masta Killah]
Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hittin all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the Syndrome

[Outro: Raekwon and others]
Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly
Remember that! Syndrome, be the resident
America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident

Noodles, Bobby Steels, Lou Diamonds, Killer Priest

Prodigal Son, and in the place, Sixty Second
Sunz of Man, Gambinos, forever...
Keep it safe!
Ol Dirt Schultz, word up baby
Protect yourself!
Keep it safe[Intro: Killah Priest]
Uh oh, yo 4th what’s the deal?
Yo Amir, this is what we got to do right now?
The Golden Deer Priest, the Eight Deer Ocelot Claw
4th, we got to go in again? Aight, let’s go, yo

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Anunnakis with animal bodies scanning safari
Shape-shift, land of Mugabe, that’s where the god be
With my Sumerian colleagues, lighters, cameras in lobbies
I’m channelling Gandhi, killers with hammers and party
The Technology Lord fights with a Mechanical Army
It’s the writer on the clay tablets, grave of the abbots
Pray through the Sabbath, God word splays at the dragon
His captain and his cabin
Engineer the beast gears with Satan mechanics
Pagans invaded our campus, nation implanted
The blood in my veins is true blue, blood in my wings is from Nibiru
The blood of a king, celestial beings, the Essenes, now who you?

[Break: Killah Priest]
Yo God
Matter of fact, what’s today’s mathematics?
Listen God, hold up

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I’m the remnant of God descendants, star defender
The kindreds of all existence, start remember
Divine fist of the North Dipper
Secrets to challenge your chakras for my lost niggas
Or aka Walter Killah or meet my fist of the blue sky
The Wu cry (Zuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!) Zu
Now my Zu-Tribe, sacred fist of the Southern Star
God governs my bars, my style is above and beyond
The Dogon lift up the Trilithon
The Poem-Killah had formed, the Rap Christ lay on pillars of thorns
The 8 Deer Ocelot Claw, prophet on walls
Great as the Lord, great is his name
Swinging sword at cyborgs and robots
And y’all go watch wind-up toys, ya niggas get your throat chopped

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Yeah, you know what I mean?..
The Psychic World, the Golden Deer, the Great Silent
Told y’all, Priest, told y’all, I’m out of hereFirst came the wings, then the angel
His spirit actually appeared to you?

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Word, know what I'm saying?
Straight up. I gotta talk to y'all about angels right now
(Don't be bugging) I dunno if you be knowing that you having them all around you?
Protecting you, angles, just wanna talk about angels
Something different we ain't discussed

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Yo, Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
First Genesis mislead us, fist of all
We have to discuss who is the us
Who helped form the man from out of the dust
Who helped make the lands and fill the sea up? It was us
In greater form, we helped create the storms
That take newborns and embrace them in their arms
They hold harps and play God his favourite songs
Touch the heart and make it warm
They taught the preachers, they sit on ether
Some say they touch women in the bleachers give them seizures
They fight demons, they like creeping
Angels, they govern kingdoms, yo come on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Angels, they brought the message from the heavens
Confused man about immaculate conception
They dress in all black in their presence
They know the answers to mans questions, while he's questing
The cherubim in the jeroboam
Man should cherish them, but don't worship them
Why? Cause they here to service men
Angels, they walk with plain clothes never let their wings show

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Angels in which you imprisoned, show us visions
Play with your children, introduce us to women
They surround leaders and politicians
Acknowledged by Christians, followed by wisdom you can hear them
They could be around you right now, sitting with their wings hidden
The ghosts of the night drifting, float on the night skipping
Put my soul in conviction
Just listen to the energy, channels into the angels, come on

[Hook][Hook: Shanghai the Messenger]
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, wow, wow
I see chariots in the skies
Men and Earth looked surprised as they flow across the sky
And I see the light deep into the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land
Swift as light, we took our flight, the chosen people
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, Lord, Lord
The reasons why we here
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, woah, woah
The reasons why we here

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Before being born without physical form, a void in the vast
My space voyage begins between the asteroid
Before I landed upon the planet, it looked abandoned
Lost and stranded, I became a force that demanded
Life laws took flight, one course of the night
Searched for any source of life, light was the know the ledge
Coming from the edge of the Universe
Then past the Moon to the Earth, then from the womb to nurse
With a slight remembrance how I came from a distance
To an instant existence with 5 senses
The quest for man repentance
While others cried, I exercised my third eye by hearing a lullaby
Then I magnified inside, became intelligent and wise
Transformed from the celestial
Shot through a sexual terrestrial's testicle vessel
Small as a decimal where I nestle
Nine months later, special delivery, the Killah P-R-I-E-S-T
From the fetus to the cleavage
From atoms to Adams
From atoms to Adams, from atoms to Adams

[Hook: Shanghai the Messenger]
I see chariots in the skies
Men and Earth look surprised as they flow across the sky
And they see the light deep between the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land

[Killah Priest]
So I begin between the meteorite, now I walk like Christ
Except I'm not sacrificed by the righteous parasite
Searching' for paradise, which is the birthright
Of a celestial Nazarite with appetites to bite from the tree of life
To smite Edomites, Sodomite, Moorbites in the land of Canaanites
Following 6 flaming lights burning over 1 million degrees Fahrenheit
Bight as neon beyond the satellites
The flight takes me over cattle stocks
Blocks of ice, I began to flock, flock, flocked
Flocked across Mecca with a vivid projector
Seeking my accepter, looking at Rebecca
Two sons bopping through Jerusalem like the hoodlum, aahh
Principalities enables me to see the other galaxies
Releasing all calories by 8 author biters and allergies
I'm the author and the writer of a biography with God prophecies, and challenge Egyptology, philosophies and Greek mythologies
Going through the glossaries of Socrates
With Pharisees and Sadducees going through geology with degrees I contact the Hasmonean dynasty, approximately 168 BC
Transform from the Wu Killa Bee into the families of the Maccabee
I can see every species in 3D and hear them clear as CDs
During my pilgrimage, I walked through the wilderness
I had the privilege the see the pyramids
Which gave me the will to live, to roam through the villages
And heal the kids, walk across a bridge strong as Farrakhan
As a voice echo like Sarah Vaughan across the great Amazon
Stretching out my hand like Yon till it reach Babylon
Behold the physic phenomenon, quiet storm
I wander out on horizon from the top of holy mount Zion
Holding a staff and turned into a python, Killah Priest a living icon
Sitting in the form of a pentagon in the center of the octagon
Walking from Tyre to Sidon to Lebanon to the walls of Hong Kong
Recite the 23rd Psalm, long gone before the crack of dawn
Dodging and weaving through the Garden of Eden without eating
Speeding, throbing, lobbing, evolving all the regions

[Break: Shangai the Messanger]
As they flow across the sky

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Those that were uncivilized was chastised
While the civilized were baptised
Twelve Tribes began to rise like bees from the hive
Causing seeds with their wives
Starting apartheid as scribes carried the archives
Follow the star guide as we glide through the windows of the far
Side
Across the dark sky, then over the ocean tides
The unidentified flying object hovers the projects
Scenery, Gothic sky can pass for darkness
As the thugs transform into prophets, the body becomes cosmic
As the floor becomes carpet they rise from out the toxic
And the wasteland and the garbage
Where faces of various shades of chocolate
Dropping their narcotics and the pork sausage
No longer Hell's hostage

From atoms to Adams..

(as they flow across the sky..)

From atoms to Adams..

(as they flow across the sky..)

From atoms to Adams..

(ever see the light, deep into the night
Of daily mars among the stars
In that distant land...)[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I do chin-ups off a niggas bars, killing off whole squads
A nose guard off the line of scrimmage
Beginners are finished, I'm relentless, my spit game injures
I'm the ninja, blow on trees like winters
In the centre, keep a sinister smile
With the dillinger like John Wilkes Booth
My palm still shoots ink, leaving rappers extinct
Pulling gats out my mink, clap where you think
I go from God Body to Godzilla
To God forgive him till I hope God is with him
If not I spit jack, think witch dreams
Of automatics, M-16s, submachines
Slugly streams of blood
Clear out clubs, air out mugs, put wings on thugs
It's your screams I love, I sample them, put on 'em on Pro Tools
And Ad-lib 'em with vocals, Killah Priest

[Hook: Chino XL]
The type of rappers that be Beastin' {*2X*}

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
My saliva's lava, the wicked anomalous scholar
The author composing your broken bones into an orchestra
Burn in Heaven, no weapon can harm me
These homos been in the closets so long I'ma donate them to Salvation Army
Calmly tearing ya flesh like the claws of a falcon
Write songs till my wrist develops Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
And there's no feeling in my right thumb, my knuckles white and numb
You should see the muscular development in my forearms
I'm sworn human heron from here on
Consider Chino XL Monster, fuck Charlize Theron
You cling on to life like a skinny Luther
I'm like an aircraft carrier going to war with a Mini Cooper
Getting used to being crazy
As a double jointed female doctor bent over, delivering her own baby
Anti-Medical, non-preventable
Make you and a dead man identical
Sound alarms, I'm well armed, like an octopus tentacle
Bust ten of you, trust none of you
I'm the murdering minister when God is upset at you
Right on schedule, calligraphers spit a comprehensible
Poison Pen always the illest, today he's exceptional
Slaying professional between big deals
I get jobs at McDonalds and throw cyanide pills into kids meals
I slaughter individuals, throw rappers through windshields
Slice them from ear to ear till they breathing out of fish scales
Every lyricist kneels to my internal, incurable inferno
I beat a niggas haircut into crop circles
Hear the smotherless pain
Be the main attraction in a circus how I can juggle your jugular vein
I stumble and aim if you merely just mumble my name
Crumple your fame, cripple your fangs
Isn't it strange it doesn't change I'm a beast
The hungriest rapper alive picking human flesh out of my teeth
You get shot in the streets or in sentences like Mystikal
Don't even call rap rap no more, call it Chino XL[GZA]
On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bulk
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave

[Hook: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fates erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

[Killah Priest]
Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, "I'm black and comely"
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail

The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

[Hook: Killah Priest] x2
Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Knowledge is wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying plus the praying
I didn't like staying cause of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs
During the service he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men
Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia or the abyss
With no trace of trivia left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and embroid it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation - the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

The basic instructions before leaving earth
[Hook][Intro]
No monument will mark my resting place. I will leave only this, the story of my life. I have lived fully and deeply. I have tasted passion, crime and even murder. It is for you to judge me. You must weigh the good against the evil, the passion against the tenderness, the crime against the charity, the pleasure against the pain

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
It goes: life, difficult times and mad crimes
Some pay the price, while others refine
Blessed are those who struggle, God loves you
And Wisdom is the principle thing for Kings and Queens
(repeat 2X)

[Verse One: Killah Priest]+
Many of lives will end, it's like a sad song from a violin
Trapped like Daniel's in the Lion's Den
Tryna pierce the iron skin of Leviathan
Souls blowing in the violent winds
God help us, if we die in sin
I hear the trials in the cries of men, that's when the riot begins
Like things never get better, we forever
Serving Nebuchadnezzar since the days of our ancestors
Slaves to a mad pleasure, building great architectures
Sharp dressers, smart professors
Start my lecture, I build lyrics like an art director
Show it to you like the film projector
Blessed Are Those who struggle, from day to day we all hustle
Coming home with sore muscles, scarred faces
Scuffed knuckles, we all share the same trouble
Separated couples, sometimes it seem like
There's no escaping, the clutches of Satan
Spending years in state pens, awaiting patient
Dreams of a scholarship, ended by a hollowtip
Politics and number slips

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Killah Priest

Once shoved in ships, now we Bloods and Crips
Thugs with clips, niggas who love their cliques
Hit the clubs and shit so they can rub their hips
Hugs and flicks, niggas with drugs and whips
Cash Rules this Rotten Apple, they got a worm in it
Corrupt sinners, in my man's Jeep
With the windows tinted, sipping Guinness
Observing all the clinics and liquor spots
They make me lick a shot through the rooftop
I never seen the glory, in the ghetto it's the same story
Cigarette butts and cold coffee
Black faces and white mouths
They cry out, for the White House
Ain't no wealth shared, it's welfare
And poor health care, self scared
It's senseless, the way they got our black princess
On public assistance to end our existence

[Hook]

It's a blessing... to struggle
It's a blessing...
(repeat 2X)
Yeahhyeahhh, it's a blessing, just a blessing
It's a blessing... *fades*[Killah priest]
Yeah, as the door close inside the sanctuary another one opens
Aslan and killah priest and the book of shadows
The lion family lives on (book of shadows x3)

Yeah, light the black candles
Killah priest the iron sheik, the whole wu-tang family

[Hook: Aslan]
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness go
I write rhymes in pitch black
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness go
Red dragons, can't even fuck with my brain pattern
[2x]

[Verse 1: Aslan]
I cause 7 plagues over the land, and bring a damn flood
The devils crush your first born
Mark your door with the lambs blood
Oven class is over, feast on the leven bread
Cause I won't stop till I'm taking the beast 7th head
Black Hebrew I wear the charm of a scarab beetle
I pray the staff of Moses and ??? the arab people
The witch doctor (what) check my ??? for me
Now you heard the stories of the sorceror who walks on water
???? straight up forgotten scrolls and lost journals
A nocturnal warlock, I draw the crop circles
A black sire riding chariots of fire
Never step to me forever ready to stake a vampire
I see you lunatics are howling at the moon
Bury you down in the blackened tomb of an underground catacomb
Sending adversaries, to the dungeons of hell
I let the boatman at the river sticks ferry you to the underworld

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Skull and crossbones, tombstones, a womb grown enormous
Metamorphasis inside the month is black august
Horse bit, dormant torment, Torah author, I wrote torture, scorch ya
Meet the holies of holies, as the scroll reads in a empty graveyard
Grey fog surround me cloudy, owls in the trees
Wolves prowl through the leaves, howl
A tabernacle of jackals of black wolves, statues move
Saint Matthew tattoo's written across my abdomen
Like the roman letters written across the walls of the Vatican
The sabbath end the wrath of men
The night drift black as the wind
Big great stone church, 8 hooded rabbis read from a verse
A Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth
The evening is cursed, paintings of Mary receiving birth
Demons burst when I start breathing the verse
King of kings, priest, the lord of lords
Wings unseen, swords of war, priest
Slay the evil horde, which is the beast
Hebrews sing on one accord
According to the book of life the earth shook that night
Like the cold cool nails push through the palms of Christ
I write, his blood drips through my ink
Judas picks up a cup and drinks, stars in sync about the sphinx

[Verse 3: Aslan]
I speak the 9 evils ---spit darker than christ features
For idiots stupid to worship white jesus
Use to be judges now they serve nike and adidas
Babylon got an army of sodomites like Caesars
Turn the kingdom to a pit of ASSULT
Like to see you Sodom ---crush your seed
Sit in a temple burning weed like king Solomon
360 divided by 3, the mathematics
85%er's caught cipher with me I spit that black magic
Use symbolic architecture, not the work of a mason
You will never catch me serving the church worshiping satan
Cause I'm like Cannan, but I'm not pagan, cremate 'em
Put their ashes in a urn, place 'em in the dirt and raise 'em
That's my word, aim and kneel and say 50 hail Mary's clutching your rosary
Im unholy seeing devils come close to me
The hell raiser, spell breaker, self-savior
Tell your maker I'm coming to punish your gender
Worlds in danger

[Hook][Intro: Killah Priest]
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea - fuck that!
I'm set it off - yea, yea, ya shitted
Ya in some shit now, son
It's on now, motherfuckers can suck my dick
I'm back! Fuck that shit!
Ready to eat niggas up, beat they ass and e'rything, son
I'mma prove this shit, right here
Me and my nigga - what!?

[Killah Priest]
The emperor, chief sinister, street minister
Guarenteed in two bars to finish ya
React like a cat when he arches back
Give a fake rapper a heart attack, once I start to rap
I'm a vocalist, nigga, supposed to rip
Last Poet's told me this, hit ya in ya head wit my explosive fist
Then I finish ya off with my tremendous horse-kick
What now, nigga? Look at ya, talk shit
Can't do it, cuz you ain't got no teeth in ya mouth
And I know ya just tired of me, beatin ya out
Ya trained all year, in a karate class
It took one second, to put yo' ass in a body bag
From a shotty blast, I walk up in ya club and ya parties don't last
I like to pop shit, don't get me started
I slap y'all motherfuckers like y'all little kids in kindergarten
Squeeze yo' head till yo' kidneys harden
Now watch this, I'mma call my whole motherfuckin squadron
And tell niggas to just start robbin
Cuz y'all niggas is fucked up
And Brooklyn niggas is really ready to get ya
I know how to hit ya, and cut ya open
But don't worry, cuz I'mma stitch ya, with a rusty screwdriver

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Niggas bop yo' heads to this, real shit
Call up yo' clicks to this, it's realness
You feel this in yo' streets and village
Spare that new shit, Priest killed it
Y! Niggas bop yo' heads to this, real shit
Call up yo' clicks to this, it's realness
You feel this in yo' streets and village
Spare that new shit, 'bus killed it

[Canibus]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo I'm a Macabeast MC and I possess the ability
To run at top speed without bendin my knees
I destory shit, pin-point asteroids in orbit
Then, hurl niggas thousands of miles an hour, towards it
Fuckin heathen, wrap my hands around ya neck region
Then I start squeezin 'til ya stop breathin
You weaklins is playin tug-of-war wit ya tongues
I knock the teeth out ya gums and suck the breeze out ya lungs
Hit ya wit a blow your physical frame could never sustain
You'll probably never walk ever again
Nigga, you think you rhyme sick? I leave you lyin stiff
Put you in a horsemen heimlich til I break ya spine, bitch
Stop cryin bitch, before I hit ya wit the Iron, bitch
You can't rhyme bitch, the one triple nine's mine bitch
The pain'll make ya voice change octaves
From low-pitched to high-pitched, every hour we kill a hostage
We judge MC's by they lyrical fitness
And punish DJ's for puttin corny stickers on they mixes
Smack the stripper bitches for askin for our autograph and pictures
You'll be scared to leave the club wit us
You scratch my back, I'll scratch your's bitch
I'll eat ya salt-fish, if ya suck my sausage
I got an atomic sub, armed wit a sub-atomic scud
Ready to spill ya crimson-colored blood
The four horsemen on the back of four quadripeds
Puttin four hoof prints on ya foreheads, motherfuckers!
(There it is!) So bop ya heads to that, uh (There it is!)

[Hook]

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Fuckin pussy emcee's, gon' get a shot in the eye

Verse 1: Neonek
Pour my wars out basins
My gates is filled with live grazes
Live and die for the king
Escaping hells faces
Forces with chariots armed
Dark horses
God will make God ????? and face loses
Seven months to bury the dead
The lord said
Make a feast for the birds and bees to eat flesh
Shouldn't turn the man you are
Consume you in your darkness
Bloodbaths sealed with fire the lords wrath
Man fainted
Now they see the glory God painted
Heavens army made a statement on your anti-Christ arrangement
Swinging the sword against God
And every mountain
Unleash a vile plague on all you heathens who be doubting
Lined up
Split you in half and grind up
I lined up split you in half and grind up
Enemies are the most high dined hired up
When your times up
The lord made his mind up
Everlasting torment for all you snakes who played foremen

Verse 2: Cappadonna
I got pains in my stomach
I just need to eat
I can't take it no more it's like life in the street
Got my hands shaking
Stressed out for cess
This rap is like coke
My mother can't rest
Times is hard
GATS in the projects
Niggas got jealous since my LP
Made life better
Now y'all hate me
Putting my life down for G-O-D
I rock this
Only love can top this
Laced in clean spirits
Now I'm spotless
Pulling out nots
Now I make hits
Throw jewels at you
Reap the benefits
Laid back love eat my tuna fish
Like that y'all
My God'll slap y'all
Devils in the place
Angels'll trap y'all

Verse 3: Killah Priest
As the full moon follow my passage
Enter my tomb now strike the matches
Light up the room
Open my caskets
Theres my Mummy
Covered in maggotts
Say the words bring me back like Lazarus
Came to pass like the old lady who read my tarrots
My GAT spit
Still I shed the tears of a saint
My hearts passion
Painting pictures that's mad graphic
After my words are said
My paper burns up in ashes
All my thugs surround me like Christ at the last supper
Cold winds beat upon the window shutters
We break bread
8 Fed's came in and bust us
They rush us
They took me I screamed to my dog
The Sun Of Man must suffer
They kill me
Another one will rise from the gutter motherfuckers

Verse 4: Cappadonna
We always in the struggle
Making those Wu-Banga's
We hang like hangers
It's the essence of hip-hop
Live in the present
Write rhymes or Hasson'll never test this
Eighties fundamental
God is essential
Rents due plus the greatest lesson is don't owe
Pray with the flow and cruise through the avenue
Blacked down like some of the Jews do
Guns kill so do a missle
All praise due
May the father be with you
A child need milk
These needles are specially built to open your mind
Now is the time oh Lord place your hands upon us
It's the meat by selling bricks
To building cocaine weak
People don't speak where it's rats and 'roaches
Cats and dogs
Cops roll like Bozz Hogg
In the jungle
Where every black man is Tarzan
We are gathered here today
In the name of this rap
We coming in peace
So nobody have to get clapped

The bread of life
Drop jewels and take flight
In this royal army I'm gonna stand and fight

An Alternative Myth:

If, there is any such thing at all as intelligence
And love, and beauty, well, you found it in other people

[Killah Priest]
Sitting in my chair, then the vision appear
Starring at the wall, the wall turned into the spheres
And the spheres held the planets
Somewhat distant, some near
Out of limits, I in a instant was there
Warm currents were rushing, infinities came in abundance
Centuries seasons Zodiac by the dozens
Prophesying thy coming, and it was told
I hold the mic way beyond the hundreds
The mic turned to greatness
Greatness took me to the sacred places to give
Threw glory over me like a blanket
Then I reclined so I can see the design
Voice said close your eyes, cuz all we need is your mind
And the rhyme like a storm as the currents blew me on
Through gasses, I saw places where planets were born
And the voice that spoke to my ghost majestic
Let's show you the essence
Let's reveal to you the presents
The seven sealer of the heavens
Within the will of the legend
The seal of the lessons
The skill is perfection
Knights kneel before the weapon
Alchemist of the sinister
To heal within the message
To build effervescent
I feel shadows all around me
They said they're just the pharaohs tryna crown me
There's tarots of crystal balls within your boundaries
You're now free to explore
All the visions encountings so a mind can soar
For all the wisdom and counseling
A psychic mystique; I've been writing for weeks
Every time I say a rhyme it whitens my teeth
Make angels pillars of stone - people pillars of salt
What I reveal under the cloth, when Killah would talk
Swimming in the cosmic gulf, and the rivers of thought
Where the healers was taught
But in the mirrors seem lost
And they finished the planet Tiamat on the Shabbat
Then they planted Eden crops when the evening would drop
When there was nothingness
That's when Yah made the covenant
On the cross' blood would drip and the corpse buzzards pick
Time and admiration, stress and aggravation
I don't do yoga but I can stretch your imagination
God tears turns into prayer beads
Falls over the neck of Cardinal wearing the wooden Mary
Whisper verses over the buried, in the Celtic cemetery
And he held it till his visions were heavy
Like a time machine saw the dynasty of kings
Through the mind it was seen, the skyline turned to wings
We wear paint beads, water or oil
Saint holy men beggar or royal
Angels, devils, or aliens, which do you believe in more?
Do you receive or restore?
Do you want peace or war?
Do you wish to live free or by law?
It gets deep to the core
We perform prayers faster than charities
Go on pilgrimage but do we know what real healing is?
Research a million in years, the real healing is here
Without the billion, I became a billionaire
From natural disaster, till the days of dinosaurs, the raptors
To common laws, to all kinds of war, till the raptureYeah niggas
Comin straight straight thru
Killah Priest
Y-Kim on the tracks
Sunz Of Man, 60 Sec
Prodigal Sunn, Holy Psychatrist
Zodiac Killah, Hell Razah
Dreddy Kruger in the house
Peace to RZA, Population Click
Shorty Shy, Wu-Tang
We gonna come thru like this

[Killah Priest]
I use my pencil like a ginsu, utensil, chops into the mental
Of the simple, brain with game that's natural
Like actual brains of rice
I leave stains on mic, from darkness I spark then
Bring back the light
Niggas is sweet like a Mr. Goodbar
I leave ya ass strung out like a fuckin guitar
So bring them hither, with the, could you run
You niggas try to slither when I be the Sun
Lord of ya fuckin barricade, stompin ya ass with a
Land thru deep and narrow  caves
So act up and have ya found laces shook
Ya rhyme took, boy I give you thirsty looks
Like a bear who just been robbed of his cubs is a slaughter
I gone thru the water and the mud
The way I slay it, is rather unique
Instead of using tech 9's, I'd rather use a technique
With direct speed, I make ya sufficant
I send ya upper lake, scarred, scuffed out and scraped

Create my flow
60 Sec
Now let's move the intro duct
Guard ya shit
My maze get under ya skin, beneath ya surface with aim
Hurt his, black, livel actin
The act, the opposite of a fact is a fake
In depth, waitin on is arixec, disease
I tie knots in niggas legs and make knees
John James Brown said "Please, please, take my hand"
Yours flow, your style has now been burried in burns land
With the Arch Angel, Seventh the Land
And a voice from the temple ordered to form the ground
Sand, the Hell, twight pore the bells upon rivers
Problems rebel, now let us reglow, upon the waters
Into they become blood
So is blood under the sun?
You better go speak to the nun
Before he become priest thru the assassin's elite
Bringin agony and agony to niggas feet
Who swivel what war? Learn to speak
While I get in the circus for hundred and 43 thousand peeps
Like I said my flow goes beyond and under the deep
There's no peace without war
So shall I beat the meat, you obsalete, bringin destruction to his peep
Rollin is the deep in the night, my trife is the
Killah Priest
A Prodigal Sunn who sits in the northwest corner of the right
By dawns early light
You who cover the slummin of the 360 degrees sight
The allegic, who done takin rap beyond the testaments
With this advancemiss
I dial up anyone who second changin this
Style be ransom in this

[Prodigal Sunn]
From many centuries and decades
My nations softer then bagion mistreated
Defeated, over powered by the conjegation
Now I face life thru mental death
Havin black outs, visions of the Earth before my day of birth
But even them from the crew spirt, who had no aura and no understandin
How the world turn
Many cause to fall victim to reality
They shall die in inequity, they loss for eternity
Throw the boat on that bullshit
Makin a parody, cuz I see thru grinches, shatter ya fuckin teeth
Bag and spittin up with ammo, as I get scratcho
Separate Jamal the Chemistry in the Seven Jails
I got the mind of a murderer, bison, held captive
Torn to seven years, buy the addistence
I fear on, to the wicked, but his time is limited
Cut the Angel low and surround down to the innocent
On the face, baggin off forgiveness
The penalty is 11 plagues of diseases and illnesses
I steal vultures on the otto walls, million peace
34 thousands techniques, to devour the beast
Devastated by the ebonimation, give it ridest
But who here wanna get held captivity, shall be diminished

Mic's Of Insanity

[Hell Razah]
You know have the right to remain silent
Cuz all violent nights are deadly nights
Dead murderers stretch the death rate to express stress and hate
Mental activity, the style of potential that's a left
To infinity, and could it be
Will take a team, full of schemin demon
Cuz I transport and stalk inside and murder ya daughter
While ya brain is caught dreamin about it
Big heads, with little brains get damaged
I'm a menace stranded, to my reality is finished
No order without no rights
You can be ordered behind the walls of hell
Or jail, it don't discriminate
Similar to the ones that wanna iminitate raps
