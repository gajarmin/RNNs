[Produced By: John Sparkz & Party Supplies]

[Intro]
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna-
I ain't like that one
Yo, line for line
Straight up lambs on the arm, giambi lenses
Ken Caminiti, Basworth

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer
Bending these young Lola Fellanas over. Ace the test
Baste the breast with the juices
Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin
Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest
Baby girl, you're wylin if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand
Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam in the can
Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos, higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er
I hit the diner, the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out, leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Beige fox, 88 Clarks
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa
Fuck yall, eat a fat dick with the monsterQuadraports slide off through a time warp
Been getting money before dinosaur
Diamonds is on, llamas is worn
Write rhymes on island resorts
Dimes who snort
Some guys who slide a line inside a Newport
Push a fly two door like Too $hort
Im just an artist with a tec
Hard as a baguette
Carve a nigga head, you a meat ball, get squeezed on
Your physical being turned to cream corn
Slice a quarter for the order
Supporter, roll dice on the corner
Gats tucked, big cash to touch them at the cusp
Couple of hundred racks on the rug
Young don, son's under the arm
He treats Lamborghinis like bumper cars
Got scars, chains around the neck like scarves
Your limbs hang out of threads like yarn
I'm the next big thing
Chickenheads cling, the bedspring king
Run the ring, my head is on top of the pyramid
Pictures of me and all my affiliates
We lit phillies like idiots
Kill the lineage, let them know what it really is
Niggas is penniless with skinny ribs
I fire semis at too many wigs
I feel like Billy the Kid, skinny big
You literally live as a guinea pig
If the Timbs ain't on deck you know the Pennys is
Your finger still penny pimps
You make me pull the Mac Milly out the Fendi trench
In any event, hold the 12 gauge that's heavy as shit
For every clip we let steadily rip
Push your afro back to '76 motherfucker
Hold up, any good year baby
Those some great years baby
75, 76 know what I'm saying
77 and into the 80s Im saying word
Seen a lot nigga, word up

Huh, niggas is petty, legendary
All of my enemies, dead and buried
I let 20 hit your strawberry Pelle
Burn holes in your belly like Henny
Bet he turn up dead like Freddie
For owing niggas fetty, get cut with a machete
Lift you up prick with the dezzy
Smuggle drugs stuffed in the teddy
Your bitch get fucked, missionary
Visionary, I bust shots out the tinted M, daddy
Ghetto poet, fourth and the rodent looked bloated
You shouldn't have gloated, I unload it
I was molded to stand up whenever niggas folded
Your spirit out your body just floated
Word to my son, I murder a bum
Turn the thumb, until it swell up like plumb
Your future look glum, heard I feel none I'm numb
With guns bang on you like a steel drum
Spill blood, plus sweat
Before I lift the iron up, stretch
Clutch the tek, bust till you wet, heads rubber neck
Like damn what a fucking mess
Who wan come test the unimpressed, make you undress
To eat food like I'm underfed
Dump with the feds like I'm on a dead with' one in the head
Dont let it be left unsaid[Samples]
"This bomb was codenamed: The Czar"
"You're such an idiot. You'll never be able to contend with this opponent, why don't you lure them into the underwater graveyard?"
"Don't you think this is all kind of strange?"
"Hmm... so you know what I told him?"

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Eyo, yo yo
Vein popper flame hotter
Raging sharp art patray popper
Blade sharper, kamikaze brain bomber
Safe in the drama darts spray your armor
You a trey eight revolver next to a 'nade launcher
Immortal technique, the rest weak
Stretch 'em like Lesnar
Deadly venom whenever Deck speak
Fresh meat, we get 'em buzzin' like XB
You can't sleep, it's like lying on wet sheets
Nevertheless better in fact bust better than sex
My rhyme book's like a medicine chest
Son, I kill 'em like lead to the chest
Call 7 & Es (Yo let me at 'em Deck)
Whatever is next
INS spit warhead bars, go ahead draw
I bang your dome leave your forehead gone
Run and tell 'em "put more heads on"
Performing live in your dining room
Shining through 4-X large

[Hook]
Lyrics get hard quick cement
Lyrics get hard
Lyrics get hard quick cement
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Stripes on me like a tiger
Whites on me actin' hyper
Cypher then I leave with bites on me from a viper
I'm the type to sell vintage 'Lo with the cookie
Buy it now, new with tags like a graf rookie
This is how you rap pussies, Timberlands and black hoodies
Make you wanna slap Snooki
Hedge your bets contact your bookie
I'll contact my wookie
True blood pumping through these veins no Sookie
I'm a soul searcher go berzerker
No nurturing took place, I cover bitch's face
With a 'Lo burqa if you're less than an 8
Like off-duty coal workers I'm out of my mine
Gun powder in lines
Flow like Red Wings Gordie Howe in his prime
Ya'll try to be thugs
I put science in my bars like Ivy League pubs
(Chewbacca noise) Chewy sound "Ya'll don't wanna fool around"
House party shit, bag a 40 like it's Cougar Town

[Hook]

[Sample]
"Come on man I feel like cuttin' loose"

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Blue flames, 400 dollar jeans
The ride flee like a time machine
My regime pop beams back around Constantine's
Under marquees break apart Ki's
Park V's, spark up leaves
Artists, you see my name upon the Marquee
You charge a fee, crackheads watchin' G
Dom P spill out on the God car seat
Add a marks for heat with marksman expertise
Keep a tech to protect your fees
Collect tee's to to breath C's
Let the beef rest in peace
You connect at the lease and get greased
Hold that, your neck roll back
Both stacks overlap we locking every patch on the road map
The gold axe like Bobby Womack's to hold max
Go out back and get your shit blown back

[Hook]

[Sample]
"Man I haven't had this much fun since I was in reform school"[Intro]

[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Marvel at the marble, marvelous mahogany floors
I need mosaics on the vases, evasive
Faces of Medusa what I'm used to, complacent
Sharp as a lance, on point like a lancet
Enhancements, handmade ceramics antique standards
Speaking Spanish, a patient man's antics
Reserved parking spots in the lots behind behind the annex
Bands for the buffies alias upon my amex
She begging me to trust her on a hammock popping xanax
The money was the buffer that absorbed the most damage
Unscathed, Willie not a scratch upon my armour
Sipping Arnold Palmer camouflaging, karma came to get me
Get me Guatemalan bitches, we in the Galapagos
Guava in my vodka, some guap for the zapatos, throwed
Humping hoes, my humble abode
Twin wood grain refrigerators, stainsless steel stoves
Sterling silver silverware, I'm dancing on these bitches
New beamers, semi-automatics in the Bally
Duffle definite, hustle more steam muscles pay the mortgage
Money orders Corrlinks, push button Porsches
Portraits, gorgeous
Scary like the mortuary terrace, carry grudges like the rabies
Reliable blades, rap rabbi, double chop ribeye
Live from Roppongi, you punk motherfuckers, (my) chain
Dangle like a bungee cord, whores fall to my feet
Undefeated, undisputed, deeply rooted

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Ayo this spliff look like a shrimp with a shit
Spent a grip on the droptop whip with the lip
If I was black my waves would spin
Better than a day would win
Got the burnt autumn follicles engraved in chin
My knife-work like Hiroyuki Sakai
Vocals got me all expenses paid, boat trips to Dubai
Fly Emirates, now the shorty's thighs spreading
On bedding, they got a hundred thousands threading counts
It's 10am and I'm already on my seventh ounce
10:30 I be up inside my pigeon's house
When it strikes noon, light the flute
Bite the fruit, inspired by the loot
Throw your mamma off the roof
Then got upset cause I spill soda on my shoe
These are shark, now I guess I gotta wear 'em to the park
While I'm shooting jumpers with the arc

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Olive oil voice, poise
Pipe the Caucasoid, until the whore make a joyful noise
Fill the void, my head embroidered in the coin
The gun and the groin interjoin
I moist the woman's loins, Helen of Troy, I’m a sex toy
Mama’s boy, foreign car convoy
The chrome of the alloy, annoy that's an asteroid
To bring the black boy laughter and joy
Hoping in Utopia, the flow this is opium
You bagging bush weed, I'm clone like a Kush seed
You fleed as the bullets are freed at good foot speed
And breeze, the need to see you bleed is appeased
Victory is seized, the displeased live with the disease
Please give me 40 feet like a centipede
Look distinctive, the link that's a nigga trinket
My slut twenty-five she lust to be fingered
Lick off a shot, call it cunnilingus
Kinda cunning, we've come to an agreement

[Outro]
Sign off on that in the morning
It all looks good
My lawyer's talking right
About 700,00[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

I got Lamborghini dreams
Nissan nightmares
Moving white my ice cool as the night air
Two fives flare
Glare through your Cartier eyewear
And knock ya newborn out of the high chair
Devour n tear
Slice ya by the hair like pear
The prey I share fruit that I bear
I get nectarine in the Beam
I steam a whole seventeen
Brolic chain chunk cheddar cheese
Spray up chumps
TEC's jam like Heavy D
Hoes lay bread on me like deli meat (woah)
That's pimpish
Pass the Mack 10 to my apprentice
While I get a pen and pad to print this
Then slide nine inches in your Empress with the quickness
You get ran through swifter than Wind Sprints
You a byproduct
Of guys that grind and buy product
Black cards lie inside Prada wallets
Black cars glide like flying carpets
The 40 lay you out like a starfish
I'm doing God's work in the booth
This was Allah's wish
I put a skirt on the Coupe
Squirt 32s that'll burn in your soup
Muthafucka

(Yeh baby)

[Bridge]

Light one up
Feds might run up
They might want us
Henny on ice with my styrofoam cup
Dimes get fucked
Lynx with the nine get stuck
Rip cake and glide in the truck
These are emeralds
Only generals resemble
We throwing up signs and symbols
We throwing up sings and symbols

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

You just a pawn on the chessboard
I move pieces
On squares like Louis sneakers
Polices gonna burn 'em off like leeches
For beneath us people need to see the uniqueness
Speak your mind like telekinesis
Steam reefers
Watching pelicans on beaches
Slide long meat deep in Georgia peaches
Them whores be the source of your weakness
I take broads do what I see fit
Break laws money grip thick like Queen pin
Rolex they gleam where my sleeve end
My enemy knee bend, my team win
You bleeding
Feel the Reaper creeping
A brief wind the grim bring a freeze to your skin
Squeeze three at your BM
Till your meat spin
You hanging on by a thin tree limb
Cock weapons and pop the specimen
With elegance, metal wrench to wear, glass settle in
Your head been turned into gelatine
I ride with gentlemen
Hollow tops fly through your melanin
Cocksucker..
Word up....

[Bridge]

Light one up
Feds might run up
They might want us
Henny on ice with my styrofoam cup
Dimes get fucked
Lynx with the nine get stuck
Rip cake and glide in the truck
These are emeralds
Only generals resemble
We throwing up signs and symbols
We throwing up signs and symbols[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
I turn my pain into power
Back in the days put the flame to the powder
My lady waited on the counter with a towel
While I sang a Rick James banger in the shower
My folks is dependent on me
I wish you could see my vision through them tinted Cartiers
Women and liquor for the army
As for the car, bitch, this is a Ferrari
The best persevere
I start my verse when the cheque clear
I spark purp, silk shirt
Half open with the chest hair
Mind blowin' sex with the cognac breath
Five star spread from the chef
Never been a hater, I don't give a fuck enough
Besides that, heir sits on the up and up
I got wind to betrayal
I grab the big piece of shrimp by the tail
Switch the cell, bitches on a nigga trail
I won't nail nothing less than a bombshell
Respect is the corner stone, bum niggas can't afford those clothes
The four-four is chrome with the long nose
Call it Ginobili, your real nigga show me
I'm from a better cut of cashmere
A plethra, the vest shed cat hair
Jaguar jacket, scratch the catnip
Black pimp, you bypass fat lip
Deep rooted, the piece shooted
The fact that I'm G can't be disputed
Speak foolish, you can leak fluid
Bust his chest wide open, you can see through it

[Hook]
Always a had a pack for a way to get a stack
Hustlin' this young niggas livin' in the shack
Runnin' with the pack pull level off your back
Crisp new era with the timbs all black
Hangin' in the lobby with the clique with some knuckleheads
Puffin' L's big gun by the underwear
Just in case you was unaware
I'm still a motherfucking man

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
A new chapter
A new Aston, the ghost, call it Casper
The chain is Alaska
The fact that my kicks is suede became a factor
I'm rollin' hash with my current hoes
Sniff the Chris Mullin off the envelope
Smooth game, shaved butter soap
200k straight butter loaf
Three hoes tryna rape a nigga
I'm fixated on a greater figure (money)
I scooped the bitch with the greater figure (body)
Cause I'm a grade A nigga
Paint the picture with a steady hand
Same way I hold the 40, blow 20 grand
Half naked woman tastefully, a belly dance
I bet that pussy taste like a cherry chance

[Hook][Verse 1]
Crash Beamers, get my slacks out the cleaners
My queen don’t even speak English
Watches on arms, rings on fingers
Notes played like Coltrane and Mingus
If you can’t play the game, wing it
Remember Lee? The same as me, wing men, smooth as Luther Ingram
Ordained, shoe game strained, Eddie Kane’s pain
Heavy chain, sex, cocaine, a fresh chest pain
Dress plain, clever, White Plains, my life’s changed
Polite ways, nice waves, white slaves
My Nikes is like the ice age, Ice Capades
I rock the Issac Hayes shades, it was a phase
The legacy, the flesh of an emcee is a delicacy
I delicately squeeze shots from the celibacy
I’m like Denzel in Pelican Brief
The Porsche is yellow like American cheese (please)
My taste in women’s like Sade, we left the soiree
The Jaguar’s gray, the caviar’s great
Swipe the black card, 4.6 come with the crash bar
The seats is white like Terry Bradshaw

[Hook]
It’s a tough business, I'm duckin’ the sentence
Hustlers, sinners, crushin’ the fiddish
A touch of spinach, bruh man, nigga chillin , nigga chillin’
Bruh man, nigga chillin’

[Verse 2]
Water whippin’ work – whip the furt (merk)
Twist purp, hit ‘em where it hurt
$800 dollar shirt, bitches flirt, I kick up dirt
Shit, Bert, Benzes with the skirt, rubber get burnt
Duckin’ 5-0, whoa, Tae Bo
Eyes low, keep the .45 by the thigh bone
Chanel socks, Glocks, tip the bellhop
Checks is in the mailbox, to think we used to sell rocks
Flex the gators with the petrified eye
Accessorize, neck ties, cuff links, rough minks
Just think, I can knock your buzzard just with one blink
‘Cause it ain’t nothin’ sweet, buckin’ heat, hookers rub feet
Hoes we never cuff ‘em, let ‘em run free
The clothes? Shit is custom - we run things, things don’t run we
Crocodiled-down, Dundee
Yo, it’s a done D, hoes often tell me I got dumb Gs

[Hook][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I'm smoking big killa on the Clearwater beach
And every time I speak I hear "Go ahead your honor, preach."
I'm too hot for you niggas not to acknowledge me
The prodigy could talk a married bitch out of monogamy
I'm out of reach but your posture ain't looking promising
I'm pressing pussies, gynecology, you niggas robbing me
I deserve respect, cut a check, fuck and investment meet
For all the mess it has to for tracks I handle recklessly
I'm Glen Rice from the corner, three, in there
Swimwear twisted like Dub-C chin hair

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I payed Holyfield to take the dive
Fix the drug test, we getting richer
Blood or a spritzer
Cherry oak wood shifter
In a Jaguar, shoes are made from Babar
Roll the lethal
Seats in the Regal same color as Mario Van Peebles
I'm like a young Stephen Seagal
My favorite move's a clothesline
Dragon jacket, hair slicked back when it's go time
Motherfucker I'm a great artist
I fixed the game between Georgia Tech and Wake Forrest

[Verse 3: Meyhem Lauren]
Fly shit we make that, Marvel we bake that
Pull a shotty, leave your body where the lake's at
Staying foul places, strip clubs with meth faces
All my fam's thumbs smell like gloves that catch cases
Not trying to glorify, but my story's obnoxious
Y'all faggot rappers wash your faces in a box of sausage
Surpreme server, bare burger when we order ostrich
Opposite of niggas poppin' shit cause we pop lips for gossip
Fluent Jewish lock it, gun black like Lewis Gossett
Predict the profit so I prophesize the fucking profit

[Verse 4: Roc Marciano]
Plush thoughts flood to Christopher Cross
Throw out the Rollie with the salt, park the Renault
Your number was called
I grip the nine iron like golf
Wipe 'em off
At night ride the white horse with the torch
You bleed out by the court while I've leaving court
Defeat of course, my cohorts snort
Pop a wart and read the robber port
Drive a quattroporte
Step on the product with the Rockports
Spark a Newport
Whip up a stew, this is food for thought
Pursue the course and floss in the newest Porsche

[Verse 5: Despot]
Tell your stories running, walking isn't fast enough
These cats will lap you up like milk out of a plastic cup
You bastards stuck somewhere between fragile and half a chump
I'd bet you fucks a thousand bucks your dad wishes he's wrapped it up
We rapscallions, like a bundle of onions
How you find the gumption to be out here trying to function
I fixed the game dog, I'm neutering the poodle
Got the ruger to your noodle and the goons are yelling "Who you?"
The rental car's window's rose-tinted, dope in it
The credit card got a tank in it, no limit[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
Foreign exports, dress boss, select the escort
That was just a fresh thought
Ralph Lauren tee, the Porsche Jeep come with the warranty
Performance fee worth a quarter key
Let the mink drape, drink the grapes behind the gates
The G5 skate, apply grace
Tongue kiss a fifth, I wrap your bitch up like a gift
This must be how it feel to reel in fish
Keith Sweat's sang at the wedding
I rap with the 10 and leggings
And fed the peasants, presents
Black or Spanish be the preference, reverence
Who led your bed to get your head wrenched
I'm like Clooney, in ghetto jewelry
Polo Uzi, the stone I threw you was a Ruby
I move smoothly
Roll a doobie in the jacuzzi, after the movie
She asked to do me, I replied absolutely
Sex noises, unfamiliar voices
We made choices, the poor witness the rich man rejoices
Tans in January, forever camera-ready
Hammers is heavy, scamps are petty
Hands are sweaty, hold the wheel steady
Canary yellow scaglietti, Pendergrass Teddy
A classic medley
Champagne rolley, shows for ladies only
El Padroni, my ears ghostly
The Lex interior was Oak Tree
Librarian poetry, approach me
From young to old the hoes with crows feet
Blow spliffs, flows emotionless, you're broken in six
Frozen wrists I throw a poker chip, bitch[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah, nights from Norway
Hookers in the hallway
Fiends tap dancin' on the strip like its Broadway
Ash the hundred dollar joint, inhale the info
Ten percents on the limo, doin indos, farm raised goat
Yo, farm raised goat, arm length tucked in the coat
Old 6 series bucket approach, 3 stripes on the leather
Powder puffin her nose, say you feel my pain
Really muthafucka you don't, I'm on some outtabody
Out of body with the Shaman in the jungle
Never cry over curdled milk, dip in convertible
Rock the leather neck, full length Persian twill
Shoot the trouble on the company by herbal pill
Gotta get it, gotta gotta gotta get it quick
Fuck her good, or she on to look for better dick
I'm off the hook dawg you fuckin with a veteran
Think different express my sentiment
Put you in the sediment

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Yo, Yo
Play me never
Seats in the Mercedes is leather
See she think she bad, they ain't nuttin' you can tell her
Uh, i ain't no regular nigga
If you see me with a bitch, you know she lucky I'm wit' her
She know she lucky I'm wit' her
Like a hungry muhfucka wit' a bucket of chicken
Heels is clickin, from Beverly Hills to Hell's Kitchen
The twenty cells spells lifted
The TECHs held different, the sex is a given
The fishscale sniffed off of dishes
Uh, murda material, Uh, the .38 scrape the serial
We sat down and ate cereal
Uh, muhfuckas are like sound boy burial
Fly face tone, steel vagina Grace Jones
My favorite clothes, My ace in the hole
Some basic ho im never takin her home
My statue naked in Rome
The 650 Beamer run 80 alone

Switch whips, 456
456, Switch whips
456, 456
Switch whips, 456Quadraports slide off through a time warp
Been getting money before dinosaur
Diamonds is on, llamas is worn
Write rhymes on island resorts
Dimes who snort
Some guys who slide a line inside a Newport
Push a fly two door like Too $hort
Im just an artist with a tec
Hard as a baguette
Carve a nigga head, you a meat ball, get squeezed on
Your physical being turned to cream corn
Slice a quarter for the order
Supporter, roll dice on the corner
Gats tucked, big cash to touch them at the cusp
Couple of hundred racks on the rug
Young don, son's under the arm
He treats Lamborghinis like bumper cars
Got scars, chains around the neck like scarves
Your limbs hang out of threads like yarn
I'm the next big thing
Chickenheads cling, the bedspring king
Run the ring, my head is on top of the pyramid
Pictures of me and all my affiliates
We lit phillies like idiots
Kill the lineage, let them know what it really is
Niggas is penniless with skinny ribs
I fire semis at too many wigs
I feel like Billy the Kid, skinny big
You literally live as a guinea pig
If the Timbs ain't on deck you know the Pennys is
Your finger still penny pimps
You make me pull the Mac Milly out the Fendi trench
In any event, hold the 12 gauge that's heavy as shit
For every clip we let steadily rip
Push your afro back to '76 motherfucker
Hold up, any good year baby
Those some great years baby
75, 76 know what I'm saying
77 and into the 80s Im saying word
Seen a lot nigga, word up

Huh, niggas is petty, legendary
All of my enemies, dead and buried
I let 20 hit your strawberry Pelle
Burn holes in your belly like Henny
Bet he turn up dead like Freddie
For owing niggas fetty, get cut with a machete
Lift you up prick with the dezzy
Smuggle drugs stuffed in the teddy
Your bitch get fucked, missionary
Visionary, I bust shots out the tinted M, daddy
Ghetto poet, fourth and the rodent looked bloated
You shouldn't have gloated, I unload it
I was molded to stand up whenever niggas folded
Your spirit out your body just floated
Word to my son, I murder a bum
Turn the thumb, until it swell up like plumb
Your future look glum, heard I feel none I'm numb
With guns bang on you like a steel drum
Spill blood, plus sweat
Before I lift the iron up, stretch
Clutch the tek, bust till you wet, heads rubber neck
Like damn what a fucking mess
Who wan come test the unimpressed, make you undress
To eat food like I'm underfed
Dump with the feds like I'm on a dead with' one in the head
Dont let it be left unsaid[Intro: Lansky Jones]
I find myself walking to work
And I can see the sunrise, right over Queens Boulevard
And I say to myself...
Why hasn't Queens gotten a trophy in a very long time?
I mean, I feel like we deserve to shine right now
Don't we? we gotta beautiful, beautiful, beautiful team
And I can see us parading down Roosevelt avenue right now...

[Verse 1: T.Shirt]
Put me on as a sub-, gettin' the glove
Love in my soul, Queens in my blood
Whoever thought I'd get paid for being a thug
Pretty much, beatin' 'em up
First time I got my dick sucked was down at the Rocks
Down the street from my crib, couple of blocs
Dawg I had spots, built like a trap star
Fuck it, I made a story and parked my backyard
Came from nothin' said I was gon' be something
First thing you need to know is millionaires ain't frontin'
Talking that hard work, niggas ain't bluffin'
Road to riches, all go through the same tunnel
Trouble looking for me down 21st
I'm in a brown Novaa with yellow stripes on mellow nights
Blowing L's, blowing past yellow lights
Me and my dawgs is tight, it's just the life

[Hook]
We like the '86 New York Mets
Blunts and drugs in effect
We passin' bottles in the middle of sex
Gotta get it together, 'fore I'm bitin' the dust
Bury me with fronts, all together we rust

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Late at night, we play the slice
After the 'caine heist, and hopped in something nice
We freezing like the inside of headlight
Spit it right, sip the Red Stripe, send your life right to christ
We fire at the hour, ice lyrically, I'm a highlight
The son god-like, follow the guidelines
The men are kind of concubine, play the sideline
Later retire at the high rise, Versace Rose
My body closed, rappers copy the flows
The cockiest with the hoes, Koro saki and rolls
We shower posse's cold, and find your body with holes
While I be fucking with some Hollywood hoes
Swallow me whole, John Kani clothes
We on the coast, niggas is at the bottom like toads
I'm supposed to watch the fly stones and get the dimes home
And the S55- drive slow

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Lansky Jones]
Lansk- and Marciano, we are the Fonzarelli
I eat at Hollis Deli, bag a bitch in Howard Beach
Her body talkin', hopefully this chick wanna eat
I gave her me she always open like a Georgia peach
Quarter way to I need an order at the Satyr
This Queens next chapter, we celebrate with vodka
And some big time crackers, Matzah, my speech is street
I never talk no dirt amongst the Castas, I brush my teeth
Anywhere we find the paper like an Alfie Kohn
Dawg, I'm after cash like I'm rosen
Colt .45, till I die and liquor in my liver
While you still full of shit like kitty litter
So what's better? all I do is crack these yolks
They lookin' at me like the unknown comic on celebrity roasts
Couldn't give a fuck, I was meant to go off
Y'all like unleavened bread, you was meant to be soft[Verse 1]
Red ink, a sphinx, bitches had the drinks
I'm working out the kinks
The weed stinks, tending the chickens in a clean sink
Are we in sync? I think I need a shrink
Minerals from A to Zinc
Free minks, gators is pink
A player's wink, a trill filled on his wheat
Two semis and a [?] jeep, skin the sheep
I'm unique, the tech 9 sleep, bottle of bleach
Spearhead the operation with patience
You trying to taste what's in the cake mix
Rock the cake that gave me lift like Blake Griff
It's not a myth, ignorance is bliss
We take risks, fornicate taste the baked fish
Shapeshift, faceless the eight six
Break swift, the niggas hate they ain't shit
Liquidate the chain and the bracelet

Bang bang nigga
You think the shit a game it ain't a game nigga
(x4)

[Verse 2]
Jug of jumbos, drop a O inside the crime gumbo
Ducking Columbo, play the bungalo
That's the honey comb
Long gun, call it Mutombo
The money never run low, we unload
Young Marylyn Monroe stumble out the Gran Turismo
Rocks flood the Hublot, it's true though
Main hold weight like a sumo
Smack with the Mac double uno
Now I attack the bubble culo
Enjoy the nude show
She want a buck, I run a shrewd ho
White Clarks with the blue soles
Squeeze tools read the news
My Puerto Rican muse treat the moons with the cubes
Beef stew the baby seafood
Dim setting, Otis Redding, my coat is shedding
The G code is stone embedded
I drew the line, don't overstep it
Find you in a hole out in the desert

Bang bang nigga
You think the shit a game it ain't a game nigga
(x4)[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
A fallen soldier in Avalon
The hidden meaning
Trained in the shadow pawn
Waist deep, baptized in a shallow pond
Upon the chariot, chop it like shallots
Could have said salad, the bullet and the ballot
My chick bad laid black swan, grip a challice
Full of fine wine, full flavored
Layered in tradition, values, customs
Must grow apart and let the world grow accustomed
Let him think he won, see the truth it might crush him
Flustered, I plant seeds, let the wings grow
Trying to sand down my horns, I hand down a warm welcome
A heaping helping
Feast with my niggas belching
Two bitches from Belgium we never heard of
Belgian waffles you awfully mistaken
Lawfully unwedded to this paper that I’m making
Banking, I’m brave enough to be creative
But I acclimate like a native
Trying to blend in with the cadence
Abide by the rules, fuck the latest
Trend, I just came for the accolades
Spend more time on important shit
Self improvement, this money sorting shit

[Interlude]
Crowned prince, nigga
This shit’s beautiful my nigga
Well said
Let's get back into it and get lost, motherfucker
Straight up
Get it fucked up, nigga

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
The watch is swiss, the rhymes, these are hieroglyphs
Glide from a cliff
It’s rare I fire and miss
I usually hit the bull’s iris
One shot, kill out the six-fifty hybrid
Sex magic, Inspector Gadget jacket
Snatch cabbage out the cabinet
It’s orgasmic
A soft fabric rabbit
Assault weapon, a course lesson
Court in session, my aura’s florescent; orange
My origin is gorgeous
Whores around the sun orbit
Fellatio with fallen angels
The angles tell you put the hit on dangles
Got the game in a strangle, my three chains get tangled
Break bread at the table
Break down a quaalude, break it up
Wooden jewelry niggas fronting
You’re not conscious
Where I reside is at the top of the compass (North)
Vocally, I hit different nuances
You talking nonsense
Chant the incantation like a witch doctor
My bloodline’s brown like a mudslide
My corpse turn to butterflies
Family man, slash pimp, live double lives
These are troubling times, nigga[Intro]
Oh, man, you already know what it is
Shit, Pimpstead shit, nigga (word)
Give me the light
Word up
Pussy-face niggas, man, yo check it out
Follow suit

[Verse]
Bally belts, presence is felt, I'm somethin' else
My gun long as hell, it ain't for huntin' elk
Preserve self, earn wealth, hurl shells
Twirl a L, burn in Hell
Learn the skill
Turn the steering wheel in the Sedan de Ville
Spanish MILFs eat chamomile
Trill, slipped on a banana peel
Jam the hammer in your grill, and stand on the sand hill
Pop a painkill pill, let the champagne spill
Snake peel, twist the J, lay still
Embrace stale enough to taste veal
Break the seal, my faith is a paper trail
Placed a spell on the ageless belle
The slaves are for sale, from grace fell
Became stealth
Your chain is the third rail
Tears of pain like rain fell
Bask in the glory
Passion, passport spells pausey
The Jag that's sporty, the pump shotgun call it shorty
Niggas in my opinion rap corny
Crash your story in the A4 Audi
My dealer scrape paper form LA to Missouri
Mix the soft drink with the Formula 44-D
Hustling raw with the sore feet
Draw heat, knock the top off your core piece
I stood covered in a long mink
Look sleek, the sneaks is like a toucan beak
The wolf-man dance with the sheep
A grand apiece keep my hands greased
The Sedan it ain't a lease, the Coup, take off the hairpiece
Speak your piece (Feels so)
Or beat your feet (Girl)[Sample]
Breaking rocks out here on a chain gang
Breaking rocks, serving my time
Breaking rocks out here on a chain gang
Working, but I still got so
Far to go]

[Masai Bey]

Aging at the edge of an ageless void
Too old to be young and too young to be old or
Young enough to be paranoid
I'm just flowing with the waves to stay afloat
Paddling on a board while praying for a boat
And some rope but I'll settle for a mic cord
Center of the seesaw
Mamma told me I was very wealthy
Depending on your definition of rich and the way you see poor
I'm a father and still a son
On the middle of the road bopping like I got no place to go and
Someplace to come
Positive warns me of the deceptions of negative
Negative is trying to convince me to believe positive is a sedative
I ponder this and learn that they both are relative to life on earth
It sometimes feels like a repetitive burn
Ashes to ashes
Held captive in the urn

[Roc Marciano]

The ink embroidered
Black exploited
Crackers bought it
Crack was boiling
Niggas balling
Clientele calling
My cell fishtail like a dolphin
Instead of talking
Money's corporate
Progress forward
Bunnies is gorgeous
Picture me: selling 20's on some '94 shit
Cutting dummies on porcelain
All my jewelry is frosted
Pigs is on corners more often
I'm feeling exhausted
I pray my sins don't fall upon my offspring
Grown-man pants, wallets and ID's
Health insurance policies
Wallabies and collard greens
Eating right
These the finer things in life
I see your ring in the light
Everything that bling ain't nice
Niggas think that they nice
Scat-rapping in tights
That math isn't right
This is rapper's delight
Now I'm through packaging white
Rap with the passion of christ
Don't get the facts half-right, yeah

[Sample]

[Billy Woods aka bill bodega]

Work my last slash and burn
Elephant hands
Every callus earned
With ho and machete
Wet earth turn
Deep in the dirt
King of the worms
Hyenas circle
Cackle blood curdle
Night dark as pitch
I'm up when the sky's purple
Tapping ashes off clips
Left the shebeen with her and said
Do you dance quick
Now c'mon baby, tell me what's the word
Green thumb
No metal fingers but I'm still living on special herbs
Callaloo and cassava
Big ganga
Aiming at impalas
They came at dusk
Wearing balaclavas
You die today for the sins of your fathers
Is it really stealing when you robbing
From robbers?
Is it actually fake
When you already posing as impostors?
Shoot the boa
Kill the farmer
Crack that Cape lobster
Boiling in Durban with poison
Red dirt soiling
Black bodies toiling
Mambas coiling
Overnight, that sweet milk spoiling[Verse 1]

Rock the rope, no joke
Bang you with the sock and soap
I’m locked in the flow
How could it be not so?
But why gloat?
Keep rocks to tote, behind the console
Y’all weak, let the Don flow
Like Don down the god throat
Cigar smoke at park slope
Car float like a wood log boat
Cook more coke, rock that couture coat
I meant well, pray the good lord know
Only did work to get more dough
Slang work, let them pitbulls roam
Through the home, cocaine slang through the nose
Music really orgasmic
The glass stick might crack a bit
Slave owner, make 'em crack the whip on they back and shit
I’m beating 'em hard, defeating the odds
Getting my feet massaged at the lodge, free of charge
While the meat get slabbed
I feel the need to discharge (uhh)
Spit these bars for grip, but this get rich scheme of ours
Ride around in the meanest cars, I seen it in the genie’s ball
Signs of the times is written like graffiti on the wall
For me to y’all, read the bars from a pimp daily
Sincerely, yours
Marc

[Hook]

The man, the mac
Keep my hand on the mac like Mad Max
From that I got a bad back
Gat at least a half of shack off the gun rack
Just keep where I’m at under the raps
That’s the catch ol' chap
Don’t make me go inside the backpack
Then you can hold that, lick the Bozak

[Verse 2]
G’s on the table, green sable
Squeeze, hey, you'll catch 3 in the navel
Bleed till you start seeing angels
Scene is tranquil, learn to seem not to be ungrateful
The sheet drape you all you seen was his feet and ankles
Free the dangle like a Run DMC cable
Being strangled in the fiend angle
Clean angle riding beast stable
Let the piece fade you, rest in peace may you
When I come to repay you
Revenge is sweet like tree maple
You unloyal nigga be faithful
It will be faithful when your meets cradle
Leak tomato on the street lay you
Not be anal but you weak fables ain’t deep
Slay you and let the .38 long steam Bathe you
You lame you, peep how I came through
Show that ass a thing or two
It ain’t get your crew, and then the thang-thang blew

[Hook]

Man, the mac
Keep my hand on the mac like Mad Max
From that I got a bad back
Gat least a half of shack off the gun rack
Just keep where I’m at, under the raps
That’s the catch ol' chap
Don’t make me go inside the backpack
Then you can hold that, lick the Bozak[Verse 1]
Crash Beamers, get my slacks out the cleaners
My queen don’t even speak English
Watches on arms, rings on fingers
Notes played like Coltrane and Mingus
If you can’t play the game, wing it
Remember Lee? The same as me, wing men, smooth as Luther Ingram
Ordained, shoe game strained, Eddie Kane’s pain
Heavy chain, sex, cocaine, a fresh chest pain
Dress plain, clever, White Plains, my life’s changed
Polite ways, nice waves, white slaves
My Nikes is like the ice age, Ice Capades
I rock the Issac Hayes shades, it was a phase
The legacy, the flesh of an emcee is a delicacy
I delicately squeeze shots from the celibacy
I’m like Denzel in Pelican Brief
The Porsche is yellow like American cheese (please)
My taste in women’s like Sade, we left the soiree
The Jaguar’s gray, the caviar’s great
Swipe the black card, 4.6 come with the crash bar
The seats is white like Terry Bradshaw

[Hook]
It’s a tough business, I'm duckin’ the sentence
Hustlers, sinners, crushin’ the fiddish
A touch of spinach, bruh man, nigga chillin , nigga chillin’
Bruh man, nigga chillin’

[Verse 2]
Water whippin’ work – whip the furt (merk)
Twist purp, hit ‘em where it hurt
$800 dollar shirt, bitches flirt, I kick up dirt
Shit, Bert, Benzes with the skirt, rubber get burnt
Duckin’ 5-0, whoa, Tae Bo
Eyes low, keep the .45 by the thigh bone
Chanel socks, Glocks, tip the bellhop
Checks is in the mailbox, to think we used to sell rocks
Flex the gators with the petrified eye
Accessorize, neck ties, cuff links, rough minks
Just think, I can knock your buzzard just with one blink
‘Cause it ain’t nothin’ sweet, buckin’ heat, hookers rub feet
Hoes we never cuff ‘em, let ‘em run free
The clothes? Shit is custom - we run things, things don’t run we
Crocodiled-down, Dundee
Yo, it’s a done D, hoes often tell me I got dumb Gs

[Hook][Samples]
"This bomb was codenamed: The Czar"
"You're such an idiot. You'll never be able to contend with this opponent, why don't you lure them into the underwater graveyard?"
"Don't you think this is all kind of strange?"
"Hmm... so you know what I told him?"

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Eyo, yo yo
Vein popper flame hotter
Raging sharp art patray popper
Blade sharper, kamikaze brain bomber
Safe in the drama darts spray your armor
You a trey eight revolver next to a 'nade launcher
Immortal technique, the rest weak
Stretch 'em like Lesnar
Deadly venom whenever Deck speak
Fresh meat, we get 'em buzzin' like XB
You can't sleep, it's like lying on wet sheets
Nevertheless better in fact bust better than sex
My rhyme book's like a medicine chest
Son, I kill 'em like lead to the chest
Call 7 & Es (Yo let me at 'em Deck)
Whatever is next
INS spit warhead bars, go ahead draw
I bang your dome leave your forehead gone
Run and tell 'em "put more heads on"
Performing live in your dining room
Shining through 4-X large

[Hook]
Lyrics get hard quick cement
Lyrics get hard
Lyrics get hard quick cement
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground

[Verse 2: Esoteric]
Stripes on me like a tiger
Whites on me actin' hyper
Cypher then I leave with bites on me from a viper
I'm the type to sell vintage 'Lo with the cookie
Buy it now, new with tags like a graf rookie
This is how you rap pussies, Timberlands and black hoodies
Make you wanna slap Snooki
Hedge your bets contact your bookie
I'll contact my wookie
True blood pumping through these veins no Sookie
I'm a soul searcher go berzerker
No nurturing took place, I cover bitch's face
With a 'Lo burqa if you're less than an 8
Like off-duty coal workers I'm out of my mine
Gun powder in lines
Flow like Red Wings Gordie Howe in his prime
Ya'll try to be thugs
I put science in my bars like Ivy League pubs
(Chewbacca noise) Chewy sound "Ya'll don't wanna fool around"
House party shit, bag a 40 like it's Cougar Town

[Hook]

[Sample]
"Come on man I feel like cuttin' loose"

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Blue flames, 400 dollar jeans
The ride flee like a time machine
My regime pop beams back around Constantine's
Under marquees break apart Ki's
Park V's, spark up leaves
Artists, you see my name upon the Marquee
You charge a fee, crackheads watchin' G
Dom P spill out on the God car seat
Add a marks for heat with marksman expertise
Keep a tech to protect your fees
Collect tee's to to breath C's
Let the beef rest in peace
You connect at the lease and get greased
Hold that, your neck roll back
Both stacks overlap we locking every patch on the road map
The gold axe like Bobby Womack's to hold max
Go out back and get your shit blown back

[Hook]

[Sample]
"Man I haven't had this much fun since I was in reform school"(Intro)
Marci Motherfucker

(verse 1)
It turn beige in the microwave
Fuck what the bible says , I hustle to my final days
My fade cycle like a tidal wave ,Vinyl is played
Pineapple haze accolades
I pull the AC up out the Bat-cave , Jackets is suede
Tough leather like the back of a slave
Black from a lack of shade, straight hit the passenger in the range
While I was at the cabin bagging caine
Lavender rain falls on the shoulders of the ordained
The more payed, all forte ,Twenty four K gourmet
Fuck the horseplay, I jump out of the Porsche and spray
Till your complexion pale four shades
The lord made you soft as clay, But as a boss would know
Office space , pillars hold up the portico
Whores form Portugal , words from the oracle
Before the pigs raid , call the audible

(Chorus)
Change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (we blitz them)
I never change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (mother fucker)

(Verse 2)
Check it
The blood oath is taken , money falls out the but-holes of gangsters
Hang the oil paintings over fireplaces
Beige Guccis with the red and green laces
Strive for greatness , my mind shine like a diamond bracelet
You mistake wine for blood on my apron
Throw a shot back like Slick Rick with the eyepatch
Then slide the gat inside your pie-hatch
I should get a high five for that
Gospel rap n, drop a wad of dollars in the mac hat
Mashing the black , half a stack , push the seats back
Used to pump g-packs , now I punch the ATM keypad
Eating crab , and keep cash , tread the beaten path
Speak with pizzaz
Chick treat the meat like brass
Blow a note out the urethra , like Aretha
And send you soul into the ether

(Chorus)
Change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (we blitz them)
I never change
Bang bang to get change
I never change
Bang Bang to get keep (mother fucker)

(outro)

Yeah nigga
Just motivational speaking baby thats all
Nah mean
This for all my gangster niggas straight up man
Funny style niggas you don't know nothing about this one
Word up
Eat a dick up till you hiccup baby
Pick your bitch up in the pick-up[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Chewbacca
Duece-duece Papa now rocking your shoes proper
True shotta, nigga you noose nada
My three versus your four, who crew's hotter, Random
Everbody on my team is winners
Everybody on your team beginners
Why you do that, rapper
Fucking new-jack rappers
Flinch when I walk by cause I do smack rappers
Sean the Barbarian
Deadly dose of the dope shit, black tar heroin
The best out, bar-for-bar Pa
His god given talent scream Al hum du'Allah
You got no skills, you got no talent
You're shit no frills and your bitch toss salad
Niggas rap albums sound like love letters
Pen in my hand like, damn fam, I can do much better

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I write classics, you can't hack it
You know what it is
In the room with the floor covered in plastic
Passive, never got a street-cat pay so I'm active
Stay back
I keep that blade
Hi, hater
I'll carve a smile right next to your frown like laugh now, cry later
Potato on the barrel
French-fry ten guys
For major violations, call it annihilation
Your tough talk, I don't get it
You wouldn't fight a ticket
So why recite a lyric
Especially when lyrics get a rifle at your fitted
I'm sure to buck so tell Pac what up though
My foes better be real
You wanna be tough, alright you'll forever be still
Still I get nicer, yet I'll ice you
And rhyme with the force of a Jedi cyhper

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Roc Marciano]
Marcberg, baby fire it off
Split your cabbage
Bitch ass rappers spit garbage
Live lavish, Mac-10's under big jackets
Hit me a pass, flip that mattress
Remember the patterns
Five stay dipping in traffic
Parle stiff in the cabin
With axes, dismember a faggot
Limbs is scattered and littered with maggots
Splashed with gas, we lit up matches
That's for acting real tepid and passive
Ya'll asking to give out passes
I pull up, get out Astons
But never without ratchets
Busters feel our wrath and
Butlers will fill our glasses
Brothers ain't up in our bracket
Slugs from the gattling, spin out rapping
Flip the casket, lyrics is crafted
Hit them with the plastic and then I'll pass it[Intro]

Yeah nigga
Yall niggas is happy to be here nigga
We makin' history, lemme get a light (lighter sparks)
Fuck you niggas talkin bout nigga
Niggas gotta go baby
Death is just the part of life
Believe it nigga
Make space cocksucka
We all gotta die but you goin before though me nigga

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]

Chrome magnum, live primitive, Cro-Magnon
The oldest lineage, the coldest of flow patterns
Broke addicts, coke habits, savage
I'm in the cold with no jacket
Push the bitch magnet, with the modern Mac in the back
Dipped the Yacht-master in platinum
Uh, sent the Christ one frigid night
Your skins bitten by mice, you sniff the white off the invite
His wife like the end of the knife
My life stereotype
Why ice took rap to new heights
Them entice, thick woman in tights
Cloud ya optics, you plug no power sockets
Down lock it, more tricks than a clowns pocket
Brown leather seats sweet chocolate
Freeze watches, I shoulda opened up my pimp chakras
Push the plush Acura with the character
I thought I had to add the flux capacitor
I'm back from the future, my aura is fuchsia
The rollie face all Medusa
Record next door to Lucifer
I escape thru the time warps, tubular
High pulse, squeeze all kind of toast
Release your soul into the cosmos
Step on the cockroach....shit...cocksucka!

Spread the fuckin word nigga metal(as in Roc and Ka's collaboration; Metal Clergy)

[Verse 2: Ka]

Demi-God, without the semi still plenty hard
Invoke opium-soaked quotes, many nod
Bread in the gutter I utter it should be
Better than butter uma cut of the good brie
Don't look fraud, a big dog if you ain't hood flee (flea)
See me scratch a fast as times were vigorous
Kept format in mind when all that shine was frivolous
Crime indigenous design rhymes of ominous
Heavy tolls, bury those we find ain't diggin' us
Game on, say its on blocks need a chorus
Born to ride corner's lock cops keying on us
My young stans get it now one chance
Crook apathy like Butch Cassidy (Sundance)
Brazin', not biggin up a haven
Triggers we was blazin' nigga livin like a pagan
Nightimes shaved our lifelines, squads bleed
I pray the demons slow, Godspeed
They commit harsh deeds even if Pa plea
Counters to my brother capture
I keep my heart free
I cut rap another chapter, im a hard read[Verse 1]
I stay close to the Beretta
Folks that wave toast, know better
Gross cheddar, cut it up
Throw it in the shredder
Hoes sniff lines off broken mirrors
I throw five at your smoke tinted, rented
You hope to try to dip it like Emmitt
Your image is translucent like a Benz ceiling
I see you trying to blend in like a chameleon
Gun wielding, I’m on the low, I feel shielded
But that’s a false sense of fulfillment
Debts are paid in the death parade
Shots are exchanged from the Escalade
My late father’s name in the chest, engraved
A pound and three grams what the necklace weighed
Man of character
Get clapped up in your Challenger
The Glock nine’s black with the silencer
I’m a bachelor
Flip pies without the spatula
You died in the Valentine massacre
Crime ambassador
My capturers channel my spirit through the shrine in Africa
I fly past like a time traveler

[Hook]
It all boils down to that green mama
Niggas squeeze llamas
Just to seize dollars
D’s and Impalas, street scholars
Hopping out of V’s with them clean Prada’s
Sip pina coladas with a mean goddess
We eastsiders, jeans is knotted
Niggas don’t want it like the HIV virus, word up

[Verse 2]
Wounds and bandages, food and cannabis
Money management, advantages, damages
The Spanish fans break banisters
Gates and parameters
They see us wearing chains and amulets
Handle this, evangelist, condo in Los Angeles
That kind of dough will hold your hand a pimp
Once aware of my decent, my heir is rich
I forever swear to spit that Blair Witch
Bare witness to rare shit
Steer Benz's like airships
You can’t get this pimping out a pamphlet
Millionaire hand print from a tan prince
The gear you wear get rinsed
By the tec wit the air vents
I caress the wood gear shift
You’re weak tomb won’t move me
Not a square inch
Spit your zucchini tear swift
Your CTS, tail spent
BBS rim well bend
Man of the cloth
That bullshit endless talk ran its course
Blam fours til you abandoned the fort
Got birds like Le Coq Sport at the port
Salt water on the yacht floorboard
Popping wine cork
These are just a crime boss thoughts

[Hook][Prodigy]
Morning of the day, evening of the killer kids
City of the Gods, money stack pyramids
Esoteric knowledge and I'm criminal minded
A lady's wet dream and the devil's worst nightmare
Cause so help me God
I will exorcise demons see 'em scheming real hard
Pop the cork on the Perignon, or turn the Henny on
Spit my timeless flow, my priceless lexicon
Get at you like the Zetas when it comes to cheddars
I set traps, I'm a predator, I pray I catch a
Black Mafiosi, rogue vigilante
The shit is sad but it get me real trigger happy (ha!)
So keep talkin' that ho shit
And I'mma part your 360 waves like Moses
And get the Red Sea flowin'
That's an awful lot of blood
Look at how it keep pourin'

[Hook: Prodigy (Roc Marciano)]
Shit is very real kid keep your eyes open
(Stay on point stay sharp keep your mind focused)
This is all I got, this is everything
(We on the grind for that paper nigga everyday)
But this one not for money, this one for the power
(Wash niggas up, throw 'em in them lead showers)
Just to get a rep, that be just for future reference
(This your final warning bitch, the next'll be your death sentence)

[Roc Marciano]
I banged a billionaire heiress on the terrace
I'm from terrace, my sellers twist vanillas
Switch bellas, the chain thick big as Precious
Miss Texas with the Lexus, disgruntled exes
Squeeze tecs, ambidextrous
The team repped it, clean the skeptic
Peep the sketches, keys to heavens
Open the gates, choke the snake at a slow pace
Drain the venom
My waves is spinnin', clean paper in my favorite denim
My lady friend came from Finland, I'm a gremlin
The charge is pending, I'm on the run, I'm gettin' winded
Duckin' agents, cover acres, stuck in the Matrix
Buck naked, rush to touch bacon
When I awaken, the soul's taken
They need straightenin'
Let's get the safe fill it with Franklins
Spend the Lincolns
The Rolls Rolley look pinkish
We think it's frost bitten fingers
The law's written there in English

[Hook][Hook]
Smoke shit, daddy what you know about it?
Pimp shit, what you know about it?
So what you know about it?

[Verse 1]
Eight ball corner pocket, my hustle: can't knock it
The game chop it catastrophic, I'm after the profit
Pull a salad out the stockin', it's poppin'
I popped in the cherry blossom
Rocked the lockman in the cockpit
You frontin' like you hot shit
Shake out, dress understated at the steakhouse
Spaced out, deep in the game I pray I make it out
Two bitches naked on the couch, crouch
Gold Porsche, I'm a clotheshorse
Your boss thrown in the trough
The blows soft, throw salt on pork
You're done, prick him with the fork
Dip him in the sauce, linen cloth
Lay on the king, blesses to my offspring
Sip the water from the spring, it ain't a thing
Patent leather ski mask, my feet pass a G and a half
Pull out the fast European cab, crab
Call it the cooler, I'm basically a jeweler
You tryna fool a consumer
Cubic zirconia, I copped the coat in Mongolia
And spoke harmonious at the podium

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Twister nino, my bitch like Ginger in Casino
Pink tuxedo, show machismo
Clean your clock, soft toe Reebok
Peacock move like a robot, stove top
Stan Smith her, Rod Laver
Cock the hammer, sixteen in the clip one in the chamber
Sure-footed, the Porsche dashboard's wooden
Motherfuckers bite the bullet
The six forty seats is like puddin'
It's the position I was put in
My bitch arch her back, I slid the wood in
Can I kill it, funkadelic George Clinton
Keep it pimpin' more convincin', without the tension
Mini mansion, Mr. Belvedere Benson
Honey dip lit up a Winston, not to mention
Expenses to prints is pretentious, no pretend shit
Tennis kicks, tinted lenses
My thirst for the chips is tremendous
It's never endin', it's a win-win

[Hook][Verse 1]
Money come, money go, black Monte Carlo
Niggas set the bar low
With the tech nine and the set cargo
Slow the cargo, it's escargot
Was taught never let your cards show
Hold the Roscoe
Niggas told the cops, now the spot's blown (we out)
Robberies with the costume
Send shots at your top phone
We tycoons, my nigga, we are not coons, not cool
Thousand dollar croc shoes
Sliding in 'em,  living like a Yakub
I'm out in Yemen, you nibblin' on dry food
Crab rappers don't wanna frack us
My back is like B.A. Baracus
Smash ratchets till the shaft of my penis is flaccid
This is classic, I'm thinking past G Wagons
Mink draggin', Supercat "Cabin Stabbin"
That's what's happening
Jacket made of calf skin
The light that I'm basking in, remember shit in on
And you don't quit

[Hook]
It don't last, baby
It never did, it never have, baby

[Verse 2]
Your raps small change, coin of phrase
The Ralph Lauren shit I'm sporting, this is oil base
Your whore coil like a snakeskin
It's like Watergate skipped the court date just to fornicate
Warpaint face, your mixtapes done in poor taste
I'm watching horses race, court made
With the quarter to eight
Slipped your whore the bait
My shit is more than great, what I orchestrate
I just want my niggas to all be straight
Cause where I often lay it ain't coffee cake
Used to book niggas for chains and leathers
Cook 'caine, now I grab the wood-grain in the seven
The game is a lesson
My breathren got knocked for possession after I was stressin'
Move with discreteness
Peace to Mexican niggas that carry weapons
Big butt bitches in leggings and 54-11's
Smith and Wesson's, I capture the best essence
Thirsty heffers ass pass the refreshments
A fresh prince
Wipe the hammer down, I think I left prints
Nigga[Intro]

(Black Italian mob bosses
Ragazino, Marciano..
Sicily..)


[Verse 1: Maffew Ragazino]

Illuminated wise men, Bombay sapphire gin
Im'a monster leviathan
In restaurants with the mandolins and violins
Sweet serenade, fresh squeezed lemonade
We toast lady marmalade, aveck ma' vulay vookoshay'
Russian roulette
Any given Tuesday my shooters will come too spray
Orchin?, pop corkin, fried alligator, Japanese porcelain
Divorce him and fuck wit a real nigga
Steal ya bitch like Tony did Frank nigga
Closet lookin like sneakavilla
Sneakavelli bowtite killa
Master ceremony, Masta builda
Protractor with the G centered, Senior
Rizzuto family glow
Aura like i owned a Château in Bordeaux

[Hook: Maffew Ragazino]

Black mob bosses
Mushroom Tortellini soup awesome
Pale horses, inverted crosses
Who said gangstas ain't gorgeous?
? , world dominance
A nigga all about a dollar bitch
Short patience, low tolerance
Call me when its bout' a dolla bitch!

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]

(You know the mothafuckin office hours bitch
9-5 Monday though Friday...hit me)

Uh the message is esoteric
Its in the game that i inherit
Cherish, the weak perish
I squeeze and release pellets
Communicate with bee speak with the ferret
Twist the vanilla call it BO Derek
My cologne go smell it
Rose gold necklace
Deceptive, foreign model
The car thats a foreign model
The Porsche steering wheels fondled
And left the dime' mind boggled
Hornswoggle, the young leaner whore swallow
Milano like swine flu
The rhymes got swine flu
Word to mommy got the wallys dye blue?
Uh, fly triplex, tribecca?, the trifecta
Was blessed to a quiet nectar (sip it)
Fire extra, a wise lecture
And let the Heckler and Koch quiet the heckler
Tech N9ne neck tie, for bread let fly
Specify, cut through your vest let flesh cry (Uhhh!)
A fresh eye a guest spy
Ive yet to leave a chest dry

[Hook]
