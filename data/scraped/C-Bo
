[2Pac]
A military mind, nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind, nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know

[Hook: 2Pac - repeat 2X]
We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin

[Hook] w/ Outlawz

[Kastro]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
Gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these
Playa hatin niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you

[Edi Amin]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place;
Y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us, in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[Hook]

[C-Bo]
I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hollow points in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin up hoes and keep mobbin G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

[Hook]

[Napoleon]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal, got some war stories for you

[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories

[Hook]

[2Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfucking 2Pac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me?
Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggas love that shit
Dramacydal in this motherfucker, heheheh
Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggas Fatal and Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what?
You know what time it is[2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa
[2Pac] You supposed to
Sideways to the next light...[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)
West side, it's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Niggas out of bounds should have shook
We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the neck tryin' to get away
And to a vigi it ain't nothin' but gun play

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
HEEY!
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas
And slug niggas, am I wrong?
Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta diss toward a niggas grill some
Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said fuck Tech N9ne
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two thou we switched the game and spit the flame (Wah)
"Allah hu akbar" - is what I say before I buck you
Motherfuck busters like vell Bacardi yeah nigga had enough you
Get ready to suffer - kneel down
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga, six feet underground is where your found
Nigga, 40 water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like destiny's children - bitch

[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes - when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' regime
Deep navis with heat like the A team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas makin' hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Whose got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched
Only left a ball I know you heard of me wanna murder me
Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now West Coast Mafia regime and thug zellin' Nigga

[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)If you've got a ton of big face hundred dollar bills
How much money would you have?
And every hundred dollar bill weigh a gram
And there's 28 grams in an ounce and there's 16 ounces in a pound
How many pounds is it in a ton?
Got to be about your uhh, uhh, uhh.....

Verse One: C-Bo

I slide thru, the 5-double 0 drop S-C
'97 Sport and shorts and matchin jew-els
Worth about a quarter, mil-ticket is how we dress
True ballers fakin meal tickets up in the West
I know you wanna touch us cos at the clubs you ladies rush us
Cos we're all about our cash, luxury livin and hoes love it
Havin money by the ton, Rolex and Bossalini
A nuchi give Versace cologne, now wanna see me
At my best or worst? I gets paper when I burst
Repeatedly, heated, dumpin low-low's, you know I'll burst
To get my cash on, I spin the A-1 dolla
For money by the ton, come get it with no soda

Chorus: Mississippi

Money by the ton, that's the way it comes
We all, get paid
Ooohhhh ooohhhh, we make
Money by the ton, that's the way it comes
We all, get paid
Oooohhhhh

Verse Two: C-Bo

I'm all about the paper, nothin can come between that
But Lexus, fully diamondback, ???? and bald caps
Holler "Thug", that's what we be, who you see?
Steepin out of ragboys, cornises and Bentleys
Six million dollar homes, we stays to the flow
Now how much cash can you stack in a twenty thousand pound boat?
It's money by the tons, fo' sho' homey and all hunds
And if ya get past the gate, cameras and pitbulls, you can have some
Flossin, no one flosses like bosses do
But caution, when they float cos the wrong step, bodyguards swoop
To protect those, diamond Rolexos
Sippin that XO on chromed-up leaky's and Lexo's
I put it down, pound for pound, surrounded by the millions
Fancy cars, movie stars tryin to make a billion
Come show them my cash bundle, you are a pocket
Addicted to money, they can't stop it, it's daily comin by the ton

Chorus

Verse Three: C-Bo

Now how you picture mad loot, stretch Rolls and rag Coupes?
Big faces laced, I want all my dollars brand new
I stand true to the game, on loot to the money train
Rolex's and diamond rings, big bodies with the blowed brains
I bring the pain to get the cash like Jesse James
Til the wild wild West is drained by Major Pain
Who got the loot? Big bodied Coupes and S-Classes
And when we swoop, kickin the loot or catchin casket
Load up the rigs, with crazy big-faced hunds
Headed for the drug, still weighin it by the ton
Cos money makes the world go round, stackin off-shore accounts
Waitin on the ?????
So be a baller, got to keep it on the slunder
Milli'ns by the hundred, transactions thru account numbers
More money than you ever seen in big faced hunds
Comin in a hundred and twenty million every ton

Chorus (x2)[Intro]

[Verse 1: C-BO]

You say that I'm toughest, you say that I'm the one
No matter the category, can't compare me to none
The boy say he hooder than me, no he lying
He wanna be hooder than me, then nigga keep trying
You know where I'm from and I don't carry a rag
And all the shit that I've done and I dont care to brag
And when it come to beef I take it by the slab
Make the pussy retreat and all I throw is a jab
I represent the streets, my little homies in the ave'
Come around stunting, and they'll take what you have
Put it in the bag, jury in the cask
Once you lose your respect, there goes your ghetto pass
Be a dead man walking, all you gotta do is try em'
Turn a nigga into shark meat, I bet they'll never find em'
Call me the boogeyman, I'm always behind em'
Forty or the four-five or tek-nine em'

[Hook C-BO & WC]

I can here you screaming murder
(murder murder)
187 and it's murder (murder)
(C-BO and WC we know)
Then they give a nigga life cause it's murder (murder)
I can here you screaming murder
(murder murder)
1-8-7 and it's murder (murder)
(all I hear, all I am, all I know)
Then they give a nigga life cause it's murder (murder)
I can here you screaming murder

[Verse 2: WC]

Niggas be yelling they all in
Blue when the police come around, you niggas be talkin'
Thats why I stroll slow solo
Police reports is a no-no, I talk with the fo-fo
Dubcudda, lie you in your casket
Sock the lenses out your designer glasses
The west of the imperial, gun with no serial
O-G, but keep it H-double-O-D, to the O-D
Niggas can't fuck with me, but fuck with me
And I literally bury you bastards
Leave you chest down, with your head backwards
I stay strapped, so get it understood
Before this rap shit, I was fucking with the hood
Them other niggas rappers, dub is the server
The opposite of death, loc I live for the murder
You know the G-code, 1-8-7 is the penal
Dub and C-BO

[Hook]

[Verse 3: C-BO]

Ya, I'm rolling through the hood with the strap on me
When I see this nigga Im'ma kidnap homie
Duct tape clap, it's a grand rap homie
Then toss him off in the river, just like that homie
Born killas, nine milli's that handle mine
Play with me, you play with your life and I dont gamble mine
I'm from a set, where we wet em' just for their shoe strings
You might think it's fucked up, but this is how do things
South side Sacramento dont stop in it
The maniac deuce nine, the block get it
When it come to the lick, we like to forty things
And i've been ali baba ever since the hood caughted me
Bandannas and big cannons we fucking g's
Ak's and banana clips for the enemies
So go hard or nigga just go the fuck home
If you ain't putting bodies in the bag, then get the fuck home

[Hook][Verse One: C-Bo]

Twenty five years old, still tryin to make a livin off-a
One live, then they're only slugs give a nigga
Fuck holes in my chest, took my last breath
I, squeeze my Mag and I'm taggin him to his death ridah
Surpise the whole block when we slide up
An expedition in business, holdin them 9's up
First to die be the first nigga that speak
Murdered to death in the Killafornia streets
I live my life behind a pistol, smash for the cash
Bitch, life is too short that's why we murdered your ass
Give a shout to y'all homies, gave your pussy to a thug nigga
And all the cops they gave their money to the drug dealers
Dump slugs on all y'all piggies, that club nigga
And big dicks is why you white bitches love niggas
A black warrior, finger on the fuckin trigger
Before I die bet they realise I'm a real nigga

[Chorus: C-Bo]

It ain't no clowin this trick, real niggas'll load clips
Pushin luxury cars, when we dip
It's all about stackin them chips, makin that long money flip
And haters that trip a click to catch clips, for real niggas
*repeat*

[Verse Two: The Jacka]

Bailin times, fuck it, Mob Figgas'll get the bustin
Ain't no exit out the dip, stuck is how I'm livin
Driven to be that male factor
It's like I have ???? a boot cha or do ya out the frame, and loot the cash
Rush ya, bust ya, with fo'-fifths and extra clips
Entrepeneur, check my profile, that Mob nigga now
Pushin weight to my Eastend loc, he called me *?craze is grey?*
Like Tony but never phony, that bitch ???? ????

[Verse 3: Ap-9]
I'm bringin it to em like this, Mob Figgas, real niggas down to kill niggas
Five niggas, live niggas, lick and do or die, nigga
Nine's nigga's time's tickin when I blow your mind, nigga
Call me AP-9, nigga, boogie's when we rhyme, nigga
I hit the block and have it sold
See my freakers hittin vicious on them po's, that's the way the game goes
On tre-low, I stay low, dippin crate loads
Never had my niggas leavin nappy, runnin big blocks and cavi

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3: Husalah]

It's the husalah, you figure out I pack the biggest strap
Boy, I get savage, fold some cabbage, paper chasin is effect
Real niggas lost the fake, and a war that's takin place
You might get chopped up by the gauge, you ain't the kind that can't relate
Walk and trip into my car, stompin a chop off in my drawers
It's the hustler verse em all, so I blast if it's called fo'
Your detective ass wears raw do', real niggas keepin it inside do'
While real niggas is ridin, that's how we flex when we despise

[Verse 4: Rydah J Kylde]
The Mob Figgas, I grew up with these niggas
Trust my life for real niggas, ??? be the first to blast
So I don't have no fear, when I'm out here
But life still be makin me sick
Had to feel the Gleec kick and see heat rip flesh from the unfortunate
Allah bless your soul
I know I was wrong but he crossed the real
So I prayed that you will have understandin and feel
My story, when it's time to wrestle niggas to respect

[Verse 5: Fed-X)
Real niggas out to get, out to get it on
Screamin "Fuck em all" wit my back against the wall
They can't hold me back, I be the first to dump
On the worthless filth punk as he jump, felts kick from the pump
When my nuts was young, we see they hung to the floor
And when they severs 2-11's like teflon dyin out the door
What they know? We Mob Figgas, born in them savage times
Fuck your average ass rhymes, nigga

[Chorus]*(Otis & Shug)*

Gotta get my money!
Gotta get my money!
Gotta get it... !

*(Chorus)*

Diamonds an clothes (diamonds an clothes)
Money an hoes (money an hoes)
Make lotta doe (make lotta doe)
For them thugs an Kavieal's
Mobbin' a Range (mobbin' a Range)
Stackin my change (stackin my change)
Cuz it ain't no thang (cuz it ain't no thang)
Gettin it to me's how we play

Verse 1 *(Bart)*

We hit the spot on a Sunday afternoon
It's hella hot the homies sellin rocks
Actin' a fool
Aight, cool
You know the rules
Linen an jewels
But you can catch me in a Lex side lined by the pool
The Mobb kind wit no care for the vice
My crew was trife
Stay influenced for a selectable price
The Mobb Life
The lime light
We balla tight
Mercedez an pretty ladies to fill a room full of spikes
You bitches hate it cuz we finally made it
First it was famous now it's the world that we out there takin
No longer chasin
Kamakazi to the world yellin
"You cowards jealous!"
An wonder why that we all felons
I do it better
Crack your cerebellum
I push a kick to watch my stack develop
You playa hatas got me born to swell up
On a mission dodgin clips
An the Mobb representin
It's Kaviealstar's
Handle Bar wishes
Uh

Chorus *(Otis & Shug)*

Verse 2 *(C-Bo)*

We get the money
Mo' money
That's how it came
Rolex, chains an thangs
My mission's to only gain
When Otis & Shug sang we get them major change
Two live playas on they way to do major thangs
Not juss to floss
We be the boss
Like Kingpin's
Me an B.A. in a rag Ferari swingin
Wit the connection like the WESTSIDE!
On the best side
We do it, gotta get the money... right
An keep it crackin like Kastro hoes say
Money over tricks buy the tons wit no play
House party poppin at the Malibu estates
Diamond jew-els
Big bodies an sails an Navigate's
We get them light skinned
Dark skinned
Short an tall
We like them baseball playas you know we knocks 'em all
Catch me at home plate, butt naked in my drawls
Grand slams an home runs they never find the ball
We Kavial's!

*(Chorus)*

Verse 3 *(Bart)*

Steppin wit my weapon concentratin on seven
Got both of my knees dirty
Gamblin
Two grand on eleven
My nigga hit
Yellin out this shit
Shake 'em up better
But I'm juss scramblin
Handlin
My portion of chedda
We good fellas
Hood fellas
Pop the Crist an hop in the six-hundred
Cuz ain't question where that bitch runnin
I hit 'em an quit 'em
Stick 'em an lick 'em
But if it's worse enough I bet she pullin my linen
My head spinnin
Legs bendin
It's all splended
We all grinnin
Cuz havin a ball cuz we all chillin
Juss feel the realest
Don't need to mention
We juss kickin an stick up enough doe to make a livin, livin

*(Chorus)* 2x[Intro]

We bangin' by the book
Got shot in the neck tryin' to get away
And to a vigi it ain't nothin' but gun play

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
HEEY!
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas
And slug niggas, am I wrong?
Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta diss toward a niggas grill some
Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said fuck Tech N9ne
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two thou we switched the game and spit the flame (Wah)
"Allah hu akbar" - is what I say before I buck you
Motherfuck busters like vell Bacardi yeah nigga had enough you
Get ready to suffer - kneel down
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga, six feet underground is where your found
Nigga, 40 water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like destiny's children - bitch

[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes - when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' regime
Deep navis with heat like the A team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas makin' hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Whose got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched
Only left a ball I know you heard of me wanna murder me
Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now West Coast Mafia regime and thug zellin' Nigga

[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)Verse 1-(C-Bo)

My first name is Smith, my last name is Wesson
But in yo hood I'm known as 357
Have yo neighborhood punk quick to shoot a man
And have Clark Kent thinkin' that he's superman
Wit six in the cylinders chambers
I'm the cup of courage that got ya feelin' like the ultimate banger
But some fools misuse my abilities
Doin' drive-by shootin' everythingthey see
I'm quick to cap it in yo life if you tempt me
Playin' Russian Roulette but is the cylinder empty
Fully loaded fool, you shouldn't have been trippin
Then you wouldn't be holdin' yo head in yo hands to keep yo brains from drippin
I'm a lethal weapon registered in everythang
Used by the police, dope dealers an yo local gang
I'm the hardest muthafucka alive, right in front of yo eyes
Kill any man wit the quickness now who the fuck am I?

(Chorus)

I'm Mr. Tre-five-seven, quick to peel a cap
I'm yo friend to the end, you know I got yo back
I'm known to every trigga finga so everytime you squeeze
I'm kick out so much heat I'm bringin he-man to his knees
I'm Mr. Tre-five-seven, fool you know me I'm the reason why yo punk ass got locked up for that murder beef
Cuz after all I'm only a gun, an a gun ain't got no love
Remember that when you fill me up wit them hollow point slugs

Verse 2-(C-BO)

Mr. Tre-five-seven, I send that ass to heaven
Quick to murder muthafuckaz, an quick to pull 211's
I turn a big bad nigga into a cowardly lion
An if he's thinkin about jackin, boy I'll keep his ass from tryin
See I don't give a fuck, pull the trigga an I'll buck
When you rollin wit tre-five, fool, whoever steps is suicide
I never been a snitch, but if you do some crazy shit
You best to have a handkerchief to wipe the finger prints off yo grip
Cuz if you down I'm down, fool, it ain't no half-steppin
I'm a leathal weapon, just point me in his direction
An ain't no tellin who I'll hit so you niggas better run
I'm Mr. Tre-five-seven, that's any kind of killaz gun

(chorus)

Verse 3-(C-BO)

No one can hang, I'm the downest on this earth
No regrets, no sorrows, no remorse when I burst
I hang on the side of your task force an the waist of yo neighborhood killaz
Might catch me up under the seat, or ridin in the lap of yo dope dealaz
I'm known to robbin banks, jewelry stores, an 7-11's
Some use me for protection, an some use me for 1-8-7's
It's best to call the police if you think you see me comin'
But whatever you don't run cuz you might tempt me to start gunnin
I kill at will, quick to spill guts when I bust
An when a habit drops, you muthafuckaz can't touch
Mo deadlier than a pitbull, when you locked up in my sight
So stay up outta my path, an beware because I bite

(chorus)[Verse 1: Slick Pull]
You don't ride delinquent
Roll with nothing but misfits
Grind all day, get my money in a stink pit
Or should I say a stink pipe, or should I say a stink hole
You going down fast, like you stuck in a sink hole
I'm at your door, no need to cover up your peephole
It's just me and the guns and a couple amigos
If G were here today, would holler hasta manana
Sooner or later, we gone be at your ass partner
I like to get it poppin', I don't be doing it talkin'
Walk in and push your belt like, Christopher Walken
All out war, but it started all over flowers
Now it's hit some broad dinner
While you cowards be bullet dodged

[Hook: Dead Mic]
High speed, in the fast lane
Ride hard, got the hustle in my damn veins
Stacks or racks stuffed in my Gucci bag
No rehab, I'm addicted to the damn game

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I told Dead Mic got ya homie
Vet, couple choppers on me
WestSide nigga, where they're known to grow the best broccoli homie
Lookin' out for the drive-by, your man'll go missing
So I keep my neighborhood on lock like we landed in San Quinn
Yeah, these niggas know what it is
I'm in this shit for the long run
Stuffed Ts, khakis, and wife beaters with long guns
Where the color of your shoestrings, will send a nigga on one
Have niggas throwin' gang signs, shootin' trying to dome one
The respect's amazing, street cred. through the roof
I really did main line time, they said I'm the truth
Cause I ain't never whine
And I'll be dead before you others see me on the news
Tryin' to shed time, tryin' to fight crime
Nah, that ain't like mine
We had a lifeline
We still got niggas bouncin' back off nines and dimes
And get right back in that kitchen
Mask on, and back to whippin'
A fiend for the money, man this shit is so addictive

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Spider man, I still be creepin' where you sleepin'
And we can get to squeezing and start killing for no reason
But I'm steadily on this rap shit
No more selling crack, shit
Trust me I still pack shit
Nigga it's still the season
Of the sickness, get your dick split
Nigga this still crip shit
Spit that cocaine, I'm getting you mothafuckers addicted
Shit, I had it hard, like Vicodin with addiction
Cowboys and Indians, always was a misfit
24, 29, 21st, garden blocc
Yeah, we put Sac on the map, other niggas hardly not
Gurr, tryin' to help the young niggas out
We could only do so much, or pull triggers out
And if we don't sell, we going back to that other shit
Damn, I just ran out, C-Bo got that other clip
64 ridin' up, somebody about to get their dick split
Yeah I still love it nigga (love what?), it's so addictive

[Hook]

[Outro]
[C-Bo] a fiend for the money, man this shit is so addictive
[Slick Pull] grind all day, get my money in a stink pit
[C-Bo] a fiend for the money, man this shit is so addictive[2Pac] They say

[Intro/Hook]
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me a timer
[2Pac] I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
[E-40] Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[2Pac] That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Hook]

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, 2Pac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot]
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[Hook]

[2Pac] C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40] Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse 3: E-40]
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the trauma plate
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

[Richie Rich]
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double-edgin' for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleeding and you needing
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[2Pac] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo] The whole clickilation fool
[E-4]) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

[2Pac] Why them niggas acting like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at? It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[2Pac] Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some hurricane
[E-40] A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa

Published by Songs of Universal"Get down, get down"

My AK is puttin in much work
Pop in the clip a little voice in my head said "Murder"
Stuck the tip out the window and fucked em all
Took they ass to the hole like basketball
Hit the club got drunk but they better start gettin off
OGs kept they fuckers from my sawed off
I know they mad but who gives a fuck
What goes around comes around, they should have ducked
We open fire on the whole motherfuckin crowd
Jumped out started beatin motherfuckers down
Then I'm sideways comin off the speed bump
I'm standin up in the drop with the riot pump
My name is Cowboy, C-Bo for short
When niggas hear Cowboy they hit the flo'
Cause they know I'm a god damn psycho
And I always bust caps at the night yo
Young punks want funk but they don't
Shoot once, hit the gas, and then they gone
Little ho tried to pick Bo like an afro
Didn't know I just gotta press triple O
I'm a mobster, killin make my dick hard
You wanna lay you better have a bullet proof car
Cause the shit that we packin' ain't water guns
So when we kick listen up hoes better run
I don't like shootin hoes, I like to fuck
You don't rub you car windows gettin fucked up
Roll a seven- deuce Cutlass can't touch this
Vogue smoke like dope when I say fuck this
Wound my windows down still smoke tinted
Shotgun mad Glocks all up in it
And we all pack heat, cause we all family
So watch your back motherfucker understand me
So if you mobbin through this state fair
Hope you got the gat in the trunk, cause we gon' start funk
We hit the out of town clubs, like nuts
We in the drive by, fo' schools in the cut
I watched niggas get jealous when they hoes jock
That's when I go and take the finest ho and take a walk
Cause I'm the motherfuckin' Bo
And Bo knows hoes like to get fucked on triple gold
That's why I keep a sheet in my back seat
And sheeps gettin on my dick so she go leap
And I hear the virgin hoes be scared to meet me
Cause I dig the pussy hoes out so deeply
Straight mobbin, spray the fuckin club up
And make the jackers put they gloves up
And one times can't fuck with me
Cause they 305s can't fuck with the 350
Every corner I hit I'm gettin side ways
Have em lost by the time I hit the high way
C-Bo the bald head nut
Fishtailin' in the cut
House parties, I turn them motherfuckers out
And bust caps at the end, without a doubt
I grab the mic and start kickin the gangster shit
Hoes know C-Bo make niggas click
I start talkin bout Glocks, and mack 10s
And how I pulled my jack from the kingpin
And the niggas know better to fuck with me
The head honcho of the M-O-Double B
I ain't the richest but they say I'm the loc'est
And the one who keeps the mouth in the showbiz
And at the concerts I'm keepin the crowd hype
Cause I kick the kind of shit that everybody like
I take a mobster beat, do a mobster rhyme
Have mobsters kickin up dust all the time
From the window baby showin me much love
Let me squeeze the sharmin everytime I get a hug
Only time they get to rub on the bald head
Is if her legs is on my shoulder and we in the bed
And ya know the hoes don't let me hit em sideways
For the fact that's how I came off the highway
C-Bo the bald head nut
Fishtailin' in the cutVerse 1 (Killa Tay)
We pump slugs, and punk thugs for their drugs
When push come to shove ain't no motherfuckin love
Bow down, we just hit the town
But we brung shit like Hitler, bail em with a Sigma
Switch with the first shot, gotta check the spot
Burnin rubber out the parkin lot, pointin out the window
Stuck off indo, bumpin my nigga C-Bo
Bitches all in my business cos they think I move kilo's
I, call my people's on the mobile, gang global, nationwide distribution
Now I'm posted up in Houston
Texas, ridin a Lexus but it's supremo
Niggas set trippin, so a solo weapon is essential
Keep the pepper spray on my car keys, only fuck with hard Gz
Still get my ball on like Barkley
Nothin but the California hog in me
Touchin triggers, real niggas, straight doggin freaks

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?

Verse 2 (JT the Bigga Figga)
We take the occupation when movin, my hustle never stop
Check what? Some babies camera's peep the blocks, stash the Glocks
Posi's squashed, ship ki's and here there's thousand dollar bidders
Rim hats with feathers, more money than Perry Ellis
Never known behind ???, talkin "let my nuts hang"
Trade ya the .4-5 and the Tek 9 for a drop Mustang
A long line of killers, drug dealers with stripes
Just schoolin, you're rollin pontentially, could take your advice

(C-Bo)
We count big face and straight laces by the hundreds
Ragtops and big blocks, gettin the money
Sippin X-O Hen, and I get it for the 1-10
In a convertible Benz, fearin hunted, on twins
They call me Bo-Loc, and fo' sho' I smoke the dodo
And flip the '97 Sport to shake the po-po
High rollers count, tall dollars will never fall
In this shit for the cash nigga, enter, forever ball

Chorus

Verse 3 (C-Bo)
We are surprised in this rap game
Straight gangsta shit makes the world go round, I'm nuttin nice
On a dice, bets are more wet and crush ice
X-O, stretch Rolls, Bza's and Lexo's
And fuck the best hoes, and never slippin like Magic Johnson
Keeps my top down, increase my hatto, from Sac to Compton
Rolex down, fools shot up, solid ice
The gin in the cask was still followed by the vice
In the S-Class, we does it on the gas
On my cell, Bo poppin my collar, all about my cash
How many diggers can you scat? Now picture that
Without the feds on your back, homey, and that's a fact
We attack with Mac 1-12's to protect my sack
I pick up my pack, tellin the order "handle that"
It ain't no room for you busters cos we knuckle ya downfall
Player haters, fuck y'all, let these ballers all ball

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Tell me, can we ball?* author's note: this is the song that got C-Bo locked up for parole violation

You know I never was no choir boy
Ya folks got a, gang of priors
Maybe that's why the one-time's be triflin
Tryin to give a young nigga thirty-five to life
When I ain't even done nothin wrong, off-icer
I have no in-fo to offer-ya
He asked my name, so I came off the brain
Told him, "I'm John Doe and this is my ho Jane"
He said, "Smart mouth nigga, don't make me do ya"
Put my thumbprint in his high tech computer
My name came back with a warrant, felo-nies
Now they got me down-town, spread my anus
Buttock, I'm like, "What the FUCK is it now?"
He said, "You robbed a liquor store; we know where, when and how"
It's foul, they got a nigga to' up from the, flo' up
My mom, in the courtroom lookin like she bout to throw up
It's a strong armed robbery, strapped in the commision
At my pre-trial conference, D.A. had a proposition
He said if I lose at trial I'd get the ? with the L on top
But take the deal he'd give me five with havin most of the charges dropped
Hopped on the deal quicker than blast, and said
"I admit that, but two and a half ain't bad I got getback"
They sentenced me to five, two I gotta bring
It's only strike one swing, batta batta swing

Chorus:

It's one-eight-seven on the D.A., cause they
Ain't tryin to give a young motherfucker no leeway
Yes yes... y'all
One-eight-seven on the whole courtroom, motherfuck em all
You better swing, batta batta swing
Cause once you get your third felony, your fifty years you gotta bring
It's a deadly game of baseball
So when they try to pull you over
1 - shoot em in the face y'all
2 - shoot em in his face y'all
3 - take em on a chase y'all

Fresh out the pen, unrehabili-tated
Doin hella good, and my P.O. hates it
Hates Dick, she's a dyke lesbian bitch
Can't wait to violate for me for some petty ass shit
I gotta get a job, so I'm fillin out applications
Fightin the temptation, to slang nightshift, uhh
Minimum wage don't get it, five bucks a hour
Don't cut it, man I ain't widdit
So fuck it, I went and struck it rich, on the dope sack
My homie gave me two, and told me to bring a fo' back
Now it's time for me to start havin thangs
I flips me a Coupe and painted it candy-apple green
It gleams, clear coat sprayed on thickly
Fools out to get me cause my shit is lookin sticky
I'm at the club and I can feel them suckers scopin
I'm knowin they plottin on me, but I'm still hopin
That they won't fry me, unless they wanna die
They will be, drippin more blood, than Mrs. Simpson was
Sho' nuff, ain't no bluff, here them suckers come
Got me reachin up under the panel to handle the forty-four caliber gun, uhh
Spun his ass around with one of the fat Magnum rounds
Got him on the ground makin funny sounds, ohh
I got a problem, witnesses ten
Positive identifa-cation

Chorus

On swoll in the pen, cellmates with X-Raided
Now I'm on parole, five years later
The Bo loc is ready to have me a ball
Fuck my P.O., I'm goin AWOL
And you all can suck this dick, I'm sick
And tired of goin through all this bitch-made shit
I got two strikes right now as we speak, and peep
I'm not bout to let you motherfuckers do, me
I'm petty with a prior, will buy your fate
With Wilson in the office, you gets no date
So I'm putting all my belongings on Greyhound bus #22
Bound to another state, me and my crew
Unpacked my shit, stacked my grip
California and Pete Wilson can suck my dick!
And if you didn't already know, that you couldn't
Trust his ass, just look how he did Polly Klass
Used her death, and her family's name
So he can yank more votes, and political fame
It's a shame, that I'm the one they say is a monster
Juvenile delinquent, steppin out of sync with
But FUCK THAT, I ain't goin out, like a punk
That ain't my style, rip him from his asscrack
To hit nutsacks now, they wanna kill a nigga
Like me I blast one blast two that's strike three

Chorus[Verse 1]

Ballin in a 600SL
Drop top with the fat V12
Money hella-long, smoke blunts not a bong
Niggas can't fuck cos I crush em like Kong
I be deadly as The Predator
My .50 caliber Desert Eagle'll spread ya, and behead ya
Pistol weighs a tonne, bullets come like a guillotine
Poisonous tips hit and explode thru the war scene
Like morphine and heroin, I'm the shit
Every dope fiend needs a hit
Gangs need to stick at this gangsta shit
To take that monkey off their back and have em hittin licks
I'm the neighbourhood's drama
Dead man's trauma like O-Dogg and Kane
I'm loc to the brain, got the afro padded
Fully automatic decrease the statics
Two fingers spreaded, hittin em up and let em have it

[Chorus](x2)

Desperado outlaws thru the dirt
Sendin BG's blastin, puttin men to work
Trapped in America to die in these bloody streets
Goin head up, with suckers all psyched up in heat

[Verse 2]

Murder, murder, kill, kill
California's the state where most caps get peeled
Back, catcha, pigs on a stretcher
Three strike law got us livin under pressure
Know he wanna take mine, hand on his waistline
Side of his spine I get to dumpin with the Tek 9
Got his back smokin, crack that ass open
Bullet holes the size of a token
Got his ass chokin on piss and blood
Crooked ass piggies don't get no love, uhh
Life or death, a .4-5 Smith & Wess
I had that nappy-headed ass stretched
If you try to jack me in my neighbourhood, I'm dumpin
And ya best ta run cos my BGz is comin
Clips full of Teflons, loc'd out and crazy
And they won't stop til you're pushin up daisies, uhh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

Body snatcher, caught up in a rapture
Black heads explode ya flesh when they capture
You don't wanna see me in my beanie wit my locs on
Ol' school mouth wit no *?style?* gettin my smoke on
.4-5 stormin, rainin and pourin
Mobbin down floorin, psycho like Norman
Bates, no trace, no murder case
Innocent like OJ
House niggas get scoped by the revolution shooters
Fuck *?Glyn Craig?* then we gunnin down Cooper
Cos he wanna send all niggas to the pen
Thinkin that they fucked but Gz don't bend
Never been a snitch, *?Mark Keane?* can suck a dick
And fuck John Green, for bein prejudiced
Never liked rap, and did a nigga from a scrap
Yea me to the max, but I'm back, piggies

[Chorus]Uh
This one's fo the money
Uh

Verse 1

We ridin raw '97 Suburban's wit the chrome kit
Every nigga on trigga ready to dome split
Got a million
But still ain't satisfied
Gold thangs on every old school that we ride
Got keys
So many g's
Bitches on they knees, dyin to get wit these
If a bitch ain't about her money, man I can't fuck wit that
Got to be down to run the street, sellin that pussy or move some yak
Ask yo folks bitch like 40 I'm so serious about my scratch
Livin like a straight hustla b pass the weed, man fuck a batch
From Vallejo to Sac
Pushin new Lacs an '96 Ac's
We roll strapped, lounge wit the money from the game of crack
Some million dolla macks gettin taxed for the crack sack
From 'ol skool seven-deuce Chevy's an glass packs
Representin to the fullest, the west-side of the map
Where we roll strapped wit black ridas stuck in the mack
Ridas

*(Chrous- C-Bo)*

I was born in hell juss to be a rida
Wit lo-lo's an 4-4's an mo hoes fo the ridas
Keep my pants saggin stay strapped wit the magnum ridas
Desperado outlaws do the dirt

Verse 2

I got bitches like the mack, out to get my scratch
Pushin the '9-7 Lac, movin keys of yak
An ain't a damn thang changed about the dope game
But the bitches size the money an the price of the caine
From ruby 13-5's is how we get it
Cracked out, the metro packs saran wrapped an get it
If it's money then a nigga, gots to get it
Hit it an quit it, but I ain't wit it less it's worth a mill ticket
I'm a savage
About my cabbage
I gots to have it
Automatic, movin through traffic prepared fo static
Got a sack that weighs a ton, wit a mac-11 one, uh
Jackas when they come, get done-ditty-done, trick
Mutha fuckaz can't hang wit the Garden Blocc gang
Packin tech's, quick to wreck brains
I'm insane, like the loccest mutha fucka on caine
To kill first like a rida, is the rules of the game
Rida

*(Chorus)* x1

Verse 3

Diamond rings, an chains down wit the Rolex name
Ridin Lexus's in Texas I where my pits get trained
Mo pain
Then I proceed to gain
Like a gumbo pot full 'o sell 'em up full of caine
Got a 4-5 got a Stang I'm Major Pain inflictin pain
No pain, no gain
Was out fo murda when I came
Don't tame mo niggas, then a million man march
An hang those niggas, blessed wit a weak heart
No marks in my game, then bump an pull triggaz
Mash off an ridas leavin nuthin but dead niggas
I'm real wit this, that's why they kill wit this
Young ballaz on alcohol, that'll peel yo shit
Don't try to act like you hardcore
Knowin you ain't
Mafia's ready fo war bringin the yellow tank
Westcoast is the spot where I slang my yey
Distributin it nation wide, all across the state

*(chorus)*[Verse 1]

[Hook]

[Verse 3-Twisted Insane]

The other day

Up in the wrong place standin with a wife beater and a .38
With a perm lookin like Samuel L. and Jackie Brown
Wavin a pistol around
"Everybody get the fuck down!"
But don't be speakin about this G shit if you ain't with it nigga
Walkin the street without packin your heat homie you needs to quit it nigga
Shit I was a little nigga watchin big homies pull the triggas with tha

Everybody's off that gangbang swang
Then hit the corner nigga gotta fill up on the marijuana nigga
Two in doin too many those muchos on the streets takin that wakin that's happenin D
Then blame it on the rapper with the guts and crack in the back of the seats
Yeah right never ran from a fight

Niggas pull guns on the ones they want to get slumped with the nighty-night
Now Compton go off, then they know it's beef
When they arms blow off to the middle of the street, yeah...

[Hook](Verse1)
It's time to drop the gas from the chamber
Niggas on AWOL rearrange your
Face with the quickness
And it's the Garden Block sickness that got a nigga in this shit
So you better watch your back
Cause C-Bo got the strap
Pulling the ski mask down
About to jack
Cause marks come up short
You better back back like an eight legged crawdad, from the 44
Your'e scared to walk your alleys now
Cause now days, niggas from my hood
Will snatch your ass out the fucking crowd
And beat you down to the concrete
And then I piss on your ass with some of that Crazy
Horse, Of course
Niggas die
Meet my 44
Then it's over cause your'e hit by the hardcore
We can't be in the same gang
Cause the gang I'm in, ain't down with that ying-yang
So raise up off the block
Cause you get no props, nigga, against 32 shots
Come to my set, get chin checked
Mark, by an original gangster vet
And then I put the niggity nuts in your mouth
Your ass was in, but now your ass is out
Quick, hurry, in a dash
I'm pullin a gat and blast from the chamber punk
Come take a whiff of the gas

(Verse2)
Check, Ace, Deuce, Tre
So now it's on
Release Slugs from my strap, until they gone
And talking shit won't last

Ear and neck wrist iced out versachi cloths keep me glowing at night
When the lights out yeah I come dressed to impress

And if it's broke when I finished pissing then they handle the rest

[Little Bruce:]
I hit the All-Star game with a thang my backpack
Ain't on no train, we rolling nice ass Cadillacs
The Northstar system on 100 spoke Daytons
I smokes big with Reider and Gary Payton
Behind the back door where ballers be livin'
Transactions on nationwide television

[C-Bo:]
I'm down to make cheese
Slanging straight cream
In the land of milk and honey
On a mission about the money
Breaking down in quarters
Saran wrappin' across the border
In my 500 Ben behind the '96 Explorer

[B-Legit:]
I pull the keys out my pocket
And I started to G
Bo-Loc back seat strapped down with heat
Track after track
Unit after unit
Running straight through it
It ain't nothing to it
It's kind of like me sprung out on doves
And when you buy dope you better buy it from us

[Hook]Intro: [Big Lurch]
You rang
Is you down kichy, or even might love to me
Payin', bangin' another time
Look we got the trigger to quicker the caper
Fools leavin' they guns
From the guns to the care to the bed to the scoop
In this life ain't nothing they can think off
But working overtime, nigga
Some motherfucking hard labor

Verse 1: [Kastro - Outlaw Immortalz]
They got my
Kickin' in dust, dirty
Bust me, they must be dreamin'
Trust me these cowards heard a murder
And they ain't tryin' to see it
They got 'em in there
When I was to young to be in
So now I'm comatosed, shellshocked and barely breathin'
But
Still I respect the game
Test me, you ain't Hussein
Outlaw like Josey Wales
Too tough to try to change
C-Bo, they take me, change no
We just slow at home
Ready for war plus we deadly

Verse 2: [Young Noble - Outlaw Immortalz]
I remember when one of my teachers told me
That I ain't shit, and ain't gon never be shit
Look at me now bitch and fluwed your kid with this
Now we're rainin' on our enemies
Hennessy got me critically
Suddenly, instantly
Knew their planin' with my misery
It's to me from Makaveli the general
Military mind, outlaw with camisole
Critical condition for that hoes he fold
It Hard Labor, knowin' this rap shit might save us
Not from death, but where we came from

Chorus: x2
[Napolean - Outlaw Immortalz]
Nigga, all we do is act a fool is stay thugged out (Thugged out)
And the first nigga that act up was gettin' thugged out
Change the paper...
[Young Noble - Outlaw Immortalz]
...it's Hard Labor
Made the biggest plan that niggas makin'
Sound aped, cause it is rapin'
They can't fake it more

Verse 3: [Storm - Outlaw Immortalz]
Gotta make more warriors
Runnin' through my veins
The story's told while the game's the same
Fuck the world with your money, man, play the game
Got stuck with your heartbeat, who's to blame
What you know what I want, when you're bad as yours
Got a vision of my enemies hittin' the floor
From Makaveli to my Outlawz, I back 'em all
Keep your mind on my riches, when I even the score
First nigga where you at, speak, friend of fo'
Got a 9-G locked, it's for if you fall
Shoot first, let's play no different face
I die for the shit, nigga Hard Labor

Verse 4: [Kastro - Outlaw Immortalz]
Pick up my block, cock
Please not wanna put a stop to my plot
They locked my bitch up
And even tried to lock in my pops
It's Hard Labor, my moms, you craw me thinkin' to major
Mad, cause, nowadays too many hoes is on my pager
Pussy and paper
Pencil, politics and praise you
Chase you and even chase me
Straight to the penitentiary
Nigga, the hard life, hard fight and hard capers
Nigga, we're all thugs, overdosed in Hard Labor

Interlude: [Big Lurch]
Walked in the club and said a nigga drugs do us all
Looked up and see my nigga Big C-Bo

Verse 5: [C-Bo]
Check I was born to this life ,a sin, as a young thug
Releasin' stress over (?) gin, laced with mud
From day one I knew is wasn't no motherfuckin' love
They use to jump doin' hands and now they jump in new as lust
I was confused first to see a church
On this hell on earth
But it was them fools first to took earth
For what it was worth
I was raised in this great community
When there was no unity
And niggas be on they own
As soon they reached (?cutety?)
Be you and me
Runnin' back, in a Cadillac
Fresh of a jack
With two straps in a Pontiac
With only one life to live
I guess the Lord had only one life to give
It seems so trifully, bought a hill
This fast nigga's life's a sin
It's hell on earth, ain't nothin' worse
Than givin' birth to kid
Talk to sin until he buried to dirt
It's been a thug life since day one
When I was thugged in
25 Years later got rid off thuggin' Hard Labor(*Screeching tires, gunshots, broken glass, sirens and screaming*)
Yeah (3x)

[E-40]
They want problems; soon them want me waxed, contracts on my ass
It's comin from the pen, they say I owe 'em cash
Dwellin off the past and they need it fast
But what they fai'lize is I'll be quick to blast
Die hard cold blooded killer all about my work
Dressed up like a female in a mini-skirt
Specialize in doin dirt - shootin niggas in the shirt
Put the pistol in his mouth and make it hurt, ooh
Cutlass, guzzlin down a 40-ounce bottle of Swiss malt liquor brewsky
Talkin to a cutie standin outside the movie theater
Sittin on top of the hood of my Cutlass
Smokin on a non-filter pink pack colored edition cigarette
Clove-family affiliated cancer stick lookin +GANESH+ beadie
What the fuck? W here's the peace treaty?
Full of my Wheaties, yes indeedy, M-16's don't shoot no beebees
Programmed to amputate anything that gets off in my way
Then I put them same size left over bullets up in my A.K
I can't wait 'til we bump heads

Chorus:
It on, on sight day and night no matter what I'm dumpin'
I'm tryin to see you niggas 'bout somethin' (2x)

"I'm heated, them niggas cheated" - 3X (in background)
We had a meetin', shit 'posed to been squashed (3x)

Shit was 'posed to been squashed

[E-40]
I've got a hunch; meet me at the Olive Garden spot let's do lunch
Fool and dem tried to pass the buck and set us up for lumps
Sons of bitches must think we some chumps
Time to break out the pipe bombs and the pumps

[C-Bo]
Nigga fuck stress and pull lick, we kick in the door with full clips
Out of Magnums packin when we blast 'em we all out for the chips
FOol, 40-Water never slip, saw the niggas quick and then dipped
Before we spark the pipe bombs, and blow them niggas shit to
Side-ways up off they block, poppin gears in a big block
All out non stop riders until our casket drop
We smashin, blastin on any, while I remember many
Dash and blastin double two-three's, fuck the enemies

Chorus

[E-40]
One of my big dudes up out HPA shot me a kite today
He up in Pelican Bay three striker
Doin 25 with a L cause he won't tell on one of his
High-ranked dudes in position who wears a diaper
With the shit stacked on the side of his waist
Blood splattered all on the windshield wiper
Somebody tried to take his face - caught him up in his Viper
Loose as a goose ass out tried to down him like a sniper
Hyperventilated started havin' seizures
No feelings in his legs, arms, or his sneakers

[C-Bo]
We stand tall, like Manute Bol with bigger balls than RuPaul
Strapped with 4-4's down to execute all y'all
Don't want to see us niggas on a mission
150 round drum 45 slugs bitten
No remorse hit by the hardcore fo' sho'
Leave him stuck in his front seat
70 rounds through his front window
Ain't no fuckin' with G's
Fill 'em up to they neck from they knees
Leave 'em dyin' in the street as we escape on they goldeeze

ChorusVerse 1-(C-BO)

We got the warehouse packed from Lamborginis to Lacs
Peruvian flake powder, than metro rap
Got keys on knees wit g's out of state
Flippin' more yay than IHOP flip pancakes
I'm a boss balla now, shot calla now
Rose's Bentley's nigga fuck the Impala now
An these bitches be comin by the dozens
True ballaz never love 'em, fuckin aunties an cousins
Got a have a ??? humble, sticky green gumbo
Layin by the pool, hella full off gumbo
Rollin wit these g's, get R.I.P
By desert eagles to mini gages, to AR-15's
See I don't trust a soul on patrol when I roll
4-4 I hold cuz I gotta shake parole
You can stroll wit me, rock an roll wit me
But when the one times dip, cock, unload wit me
Cuz I'm a killa, nappy head nigga, from out the valley, best strapped
Down, in Sac-Town, capitol of Killa Kali
Fool I comes heated, when needed, niggas retreat
When I blast pair of parabellums an a mini 14 when I smash

(Chorus)

None of y'all niggas can't fade this
West coast niggas is the craziest
We got that MOB mentality
C-BO an S-P-I-C-E
None of y'all niggas can't fade this
West coast niggas is the craziest
We got that MOB mentality
Major Pain & Mr. Bossalini

Verse 2-(Spice 1)

(Straight G's)
Pullin our straps on niggas who thinkin they bodies is made outta
Teflon
Wit a 5-0 caliber in my right hand, an a G-LOCK in my left palm
Black Bossalini, can't see me, wit a Lexy up on my wrist
Imagine this, a ballin' ass nigga addicted to killin' shit
??? cross soldier mutha fuckaz so nigga don't fuck wit me
I seen niggas that I done murdered up in my dreams, when I be asleep
Strapped an I thank God, nigga chasin' me callin' me punk ass nigga
Wakin' up wit the finga on triggas
Spittin' hollow tip slugs that goes to figgas
Wanna put down, my pistol, drink Cristal an shit
But niggas Uzi think he tellin me I'm gonna die if I sit
So I MOB wit the old skool, wit a shot of chromes out my window
Could it be the S-P-I-C-E wit a fifth of hin, yay an indo
Black Bossalini

(Chorus)

Verse 3-(C-BO)

We puts it down like g's, swingin' vipers an vests
From Benz to Beamers an Lamborginis all on the set
An keep it crackin' from LA all the way back down to the Bay
I'm from the, valley, northern of Killa Kali, where g's lay
Gots to keep yo head up, you slip they drop, they leave you wet up
Blasted magnum taggin' the fool of the big block we hit him up
Eyes do or die, let 'em drip til they dry
Two killaz eye to eye, never duck when bullets fly
Keep it crackulatin, like Pearl Harbor when we spit
G's bump this shit, from ??? moves to the rip set
Trippin get split
Wit a magnum
Steady blastin' now I done seen murder eye to eye
But my kids hope that I'm steadily fastenin
Ain't no love for you that's down at the end of my barrel
When I multiply my cash, ridin' in my 4 barrel Camaro
I catch ya slippin', I'm slappin' my clip in, I'm puttin' it down
You been hit from slippin' an clockin' the grip in my town

(Chorus until end)Verse One: C-Bo

I was born in hell without a pistol
Now how can I survive with one live without a vest and 4-5?
Runnin from the Task Fo' but smashin for my cash
Bankin corners, hop it then I blast on their ass
See them piggies want me dead for sure or in the pen
Doin 10, instead of me in my Benz on some twins
Sippin Hen, smokin indica bomb
And keep my pedal to the metal til I'm high and gone
I know you rich niggas hate me, can I keep it real and feel this rap shit?
Didn't make me, got out the pen and flip the '97
Drop Mercedes, I'm the *?placenta?* of no love
Til the lord save me, straight thugs that'll dump slugs
Til they fuckin grave, mass murder motherfuckers to the front page
When we hit, we empty clips til we get paid
I've been a slave from my cradle to the grave
Nigga, fuck the world, I was raised in hell

Chorus: C-Bo

That's why we buck shit down and yell "Fuck the world!"
I'd rather die here in hell then die doin life in jail
But take the shot with a Mac 12, order hits on the *?pack tailed?*
]From the block to Wotts, we are thug niggas raised in hell
*repeat*

Verse Two: Big Syke

I'm bailin thru the set wit a 40, smokin a cigarette
Blastin my radio, oldie tunes by The Marvalettes
Gangbangin vets on parole as I stroll thru
They rassle Gz like two craps and they strapped too
Oh how I love these niggas but I hate em with a passion
But I ride for these motherfuckers, when I don't even ask
Thug fashion from head to toe, I let the world know
That this is Thug Life, motherfucker, til I leave this ho
So as my knuckles drag the concrete, big homies hit the streets
Transgressions under pressure, preyin on the weak
I sink like a fish, I wish upon a ghetto star
If the enemies come thru and ride on me they won't get far
Big homey got out, hold 22's on a hang
Runnin around, sweatin motherfuckers, talkin bout "Let's throw them thangs"
Bang, I hit him with a bat and heard his skull crack
Then I got *?him the wind in the trach?* til he shattered, to get the Mac

Chorus

Verse Three: C-Bo

It ain't no love for bitch niggas
As I dump slugs and pull the plug on you bitch niggas
Pick up my phone and have some thugs hit you trick niggas
Wit on gloves or low tommy guns on them stitch niggas
Hit niggas with H-K's, split niggas with AK's when we mash for the cash
Doin a hundred, blastin buck shots off in that ass
True outlaws ready for war, souls will never die
The same day we meet death, the same day we ride
Dumpin slugs with Tek 9's, more bulletproofs my 4-5
I just let em fly, screamin out "Bitch nigga die"
We's about be a killer nigga, look outside
Tell me one reason why I should pray for eternal life
Born and taught in hell, with a gun store on every corner
Bodyguard, bulletproof doors, it's hard to be a goner
Strapped with heat, these West Coast streets of Killafornia
From day one, they have straps on em, cos we was raised in hell

Chorus[x 4]
Eye for an eye [eye for an eye]
Ride or you die [ride or you die]

[Celly Cel]
Won't leave the house unless I'm strapped up
I might get backed up in the traffic
Niggas is dumping on me when I got my zapper
Creeping up on me
And I got one hand on the wheel
One hand on the steel
Trying to break a nigga for skrill
And I'm ridin' wit sharp shootin' skills
Funk season, whatever the reason
I'm dealing wit drama
Send me one of them mangie ass niggas
Runnin' home, cryin' to Mama
So I kick the door to eliminate the whole situation
Fuckin' wit me me will ended up
Having his family eraseded
Face it, no charges leaving the body behind until
You better respect game
Bow down when real niggas bail through yo hood
But won't be caught up in a twist
Flash on us unless you end up sleeping wit the fish
Seamin' shoes, lady singing the blues, them sad ballads
Fried chicken, collad greens, and potato salads
Surrounded them by [?] of family members cryin'
Eye for an eye' you ride or you die

[Chorus] x 4
Eye for an eye
You ride or you die ride or you die
Niggas get at cha and run back at them
But let them bullets fly

[C-Bo]
He got the Mac One-O
And moved nice on the piggies
Hit 'em up and buck
And leave them struck when I'm tipsy
Ain't no love for the true thugs
That die for this shit
Wit 150 round drum ride for this shit
Fuck the hard hats end locs, pass the fo fo
And watch me smoke them hoes
Like the last hit of indo, and fo' sho
I smash and blast, nigga, when I'm provoked
With a doe of platinum coke
I holds down a fort

[Celly Cel]
Why you smiling for
These niggas playing games on the street
That's where they meet the heat
They sweep they ass up off of they feet
This ain't no fairy tale
You fuckin' with Cel
Hit the scenes wit machines
If you want my team
It ain't no in between
Seventeen through your temple
When your crossing the realest niggas
To spit this killa shit on the mic
And make the world feel us
Hit 'em wit rounds [?]
[?] of hollows then we follow
Niggas to they spine
And chop they ass up
Wit fully-auto's

[Chorus] x 4

[C-Bo]
I ain't no actor bitch
My life is worser than the movies
For real though, from steel toes to my uzi
Pushin' Impala S.S.'s
Benz, Beamers, to Lamborginis
And chase my strip down wit X.O., Henn, and Remi
Rolex on my wrist
Hundred dollar bill's crisp
I pull the blunt from my lip
Then the 4-5 from my hip and spit
The incredible medical or hard core
The deadliest medacine gas ever set off in a war
Westcoast's the spot
Where we lock our million dollar doors
Survival in hell, packing heat
Ducking from them
I'm just a thug nigga
Step on your street and draw my heat
And then I plug niggas
I be a G from the G.B.C
That's why I mug niggas
Don't flag I just sag and carry a mag
And get off in the snitches asses
And Brotha Lynch, you a bitch for still ridin' with Doc
Screaming out the block
Bitch I'll have you die wit Doc [echoes out]

[Chorus] x 4

*echoes*

Bullets fly
