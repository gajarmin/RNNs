[Intro: Big Boi]
I be on it all night, man I be on it (day day)
All day, straight up pimp
If you want me, you can find me in the A!

[Crowd x8]
AYE!(I'm on it)

[Verse 1: Rock-D]
Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell these hoes
That I am the H-N-I-C,  bitch that's just the way it goes
I be on that shit that'll have you on that "I don't want no mo'"
At this time, I need all my freak hoes to get down on the flo'
If you came to rep your set, right now nigga, let 'em know
If it's jail I get for stompin' a hater to sleep, fuck it, I go
Freak, I'll be off in the wheep
Straight geeked swerving down your street
In a stolen Bonneville with 23's on the feet
The Legend, Rocky D Brown, back in town to plea you down
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste, they hit the ground
Back in the A
Cliqued up, picked up with some people that don't play
On that Kryptonite stay
So high, we might fly awwwaaayyy

[Hook]
[Rock-D x2]
I be on that Kryptonite
Straight up on that Kryptonite

[Verse 2: BlackOwned C-Bone]
Time and time again, I gotta tell these niggas and these hoes
I'm from College Park where we move that weed and we slang that blow
Get dope on a daily basis
Get high, make them ugly faces
Toke the 'dro, and I'm on probation
My blunts I don't be lacing
I'm on that Kryptonite
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run tell your buddies I fucked you right
Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets
Big Boi, he put us on

[Bridge: Killer Mike]
Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Rd., Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels
Grind Time rap game, remember bitches Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rolling O's, and we all be on that Kryp

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell C-Bone
Grab that cologne on out my book bag, I smell 'dro all on you, homes
Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff that you just smoked, them folks gon' trip
Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff (Arf, arf!)
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?
Cuz you just ain't gon find no yay
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy
They play dur-ty, he cain't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

[Bridge: Killer Mike]

Boy stop, ha, ha, ha, ha[Big Gipp]
Look out the sun is out while its raining
The devils wife must be complaining
Remember that? its brothers work
Elbows in and up and down the court
Cause they play ball long after dark at Sykes park
Smelled the rain before it came
But that don't stop the game
Intense inside the twelve feet fence
Flip the mode back on the road set in
And watch my woodgrain spin
I let my window down and let the world in
Since I was knee high the only thing we had was the peachtree plaza in the sky
Things ain't the same no more
Everyday my city seems to grow and grow
Gotta blow a bed for my back
Cause I can't take the hardwood floors
Crooked system had me working in the warehouse
From 8 to 4 so
Gipp know what it is to work for them foes for a check that don't mean shit
More bills keep coming in
But ain't no saving
Used to scrape up a buck for a box of newports
But after I found out
That they was fucking with the tobac I stopped
Its like killing myself with a Glock (pow)
Its rough
Prices going up people giving in
To the rockets and hernon homes is known
By the city to be toxic but ain't nothin said
Always on the down low never in the mainstream
It ain't king
To be the fulltime
Blow a man these days you get years
And even though..
My cousin writes me from the pen
I always think about how we kicked it at the Dungeon fo' he went in
What's next?
My slick partner Toby is gone
Went to handle a little business never made it back home
I wonder what his girl told his son.......
Hold on

[T-Mo]
I can't escape the bullshit
Where ever I go shit
Always into something cause I wanna be rich
Pulling cards in my blood it seems I'm mean cause of my look
I might blast off on ya ass and write another book
It took too many times in the cage
Now I'm on the front page looking at myself
I'm on the run
Never to be seen by the eyes
A fugitive
Plus I got a life to live
State by state
Is this just a dream?
Sometimes it seems like it just a figure standing in the mirror from the back
That's why I'm swinging my axe
Everytime so I won't miss I can be hit
Cause I'm touchable
That's my state of mind
Cause I know one day you gotta go in a life of crime
Either the pen or a one way ticket
So I'm asking "what will it be"?
"Where do I solve"?
Nobody knows but me see
When I was a youth used to think I was bulletproof
Never thought I could be hit
Ready to stand my turf
Niggas can't understand how it work
What's the plan?
We killing our own people for this bullshit
Scared straight wanna escape theres one way outta this crooked county
With a bounty
Coming to get me
Then i'd be on the run
Hoping to find a better day without loaded guns in my face
I'm not the criminal
Fuck your probation
What's my occupation? Selling my dubbs on the street
Cause I gotta eat
Hold on

[Khujo]
Am I awake or is this just another dream?
I pinch myself invisible bars cover my cage
Done lost all conception of time
Trapped in my own mind
Unaware of the world in front or behind
Be trying
To catch up with myself
Evil doers steady working
Guest be leaching off of my wealth
Can't wait for my death
But got me fucked up
Ain't man enough
Nigga you got false nuts
Bouncing like rubber balls off the walls
The life we supposed to be living y'all
Them crackers got boxed up
We ain't even the middle men
But..yet... free my mind of confusion
Jehovah witnesses waking me up out my slumber
Using white rice and ??
Stomach aching be still hunger for the taking at the bottom of my barrel
Fuck ass! and being nice ain't got me nathan
But a frown
Too high to get down
Hold on nigga

[Cee-Lo]
You don't know me
And I ain't tryna claim I be knowing you
But I do understand what you going through
Seems like you running outta time
In and out of crime
And everybody ain't gon be able to rhyme..damn!
It must be hard to hold on when your faith is gone
Mmmm...tryna make it all alone
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and let the lord decide
You can't hide from the truth I know we've all tried
And I agree its hard to believe in what you can't see
"Well, shit nigga what you keep telling me to hold on for? I'm stuck in
The ghetto wit no where to go, I gotta slang that blow"
"You call yourself tryna teach, seems like I'm outta reach
Cause I don't wanna hear another speech
This is all I know how to get up get out and get...
...so fuck that shit!!

[Chorus]
Hold on, be strong, it ain't gon be that long
Them folks won't do you wrong
The name of the song is hold on, be strong
It ain't gon be that long
Them folks won't do you wrong
The name of the song is hold on, is hold on

Ey, now I'm chiln in the lounge and dis girl gon walk in the bathroom
She
Said "damm you look cute, but y you ain't got no tattoos?"
I said "I ain't
Come 2 look cute...cool came 2 cut!"
"and damm you look cute!, y you ain't
Got no butt?"(ooooh)_coolbreeze[Killer Mike]
[Screwed] PURPLE LABEL
So niggas want to know the story
Why the label got changed from Aquemini to Purple Ribbon, shorty?
Where Dre at man? Why isn't him and Big on TV man
Them boys still down? Organized goin' through changes
All I know is that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
[Scratched] All I know that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
[Scratched] Big here, Dre gone, moved on
Changed names from Aquemini to Purple Rib-bon
My first album slept on, failed to do a mil
But yet and still, my babies haven't missed a meal
God damn, is there a curse on Dungeon Fam?
The Goodie Mob broke up, the DF album didn't jam
Before Lil Jon had the grill in his mouth
Khujo Goodie had the dreads with the grill in his mouth
And Bubba Sparxxx gave you the phrase new south
Like Cool Breeze gave you the phrase dirty south
Is it only me? Or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggas of
Sleepy Brown back in '93?
I know its been like 12 Decembers (yeah, suttin' like that)
Let's remember "All the playas came from far and wide"
Yeah suttin' like that, talkin playalistic Cadillac
In the trap with +Two Dope Boyz+
Spittin Organized Noize via microphone
Do you believe The Source gave only gave 4 and a half microphones
They shoulda gave that a classic, ax Charlie Braxton
Damn man, I'm still amazed
The boys had the nerve to boo Big and Dre
When they hit the stage to accept the Source award
My heart dropped like a million other country boys
I thought my Mind was Playin Tricks like the Geto Boys
Damn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube
He gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school
So our mind wasn't so sick
Speakin' of being sick man I need a doctor
Which doctor? Bring back the Witch Doctor
[Scratched] Feelin' me, bring back the Witch Doctor
Feelin' me, here's an interesting fact from me
When the boy Bobby V signed with DTP
He spit about blackberry molasses over Organized beats[Intro: Big Boi]

I'm on that Kryptonite (I'm on it, I'm on it)

[Verse 2: BlackOwned C-Bone]
Time and time again, I gotta tell these niggas and these hoes
I'm from College Park where we move that weed and we slang that blow
Get dope on a daily basis
Get high, make them ugly faces
Toke the 'dro, and I'm on probation
My blunts I don't be lacing
I'm on that Kryptonite
Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run tell your buddies I fucked you right
Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets
Big Boi, he put us on

[Bridge: Killer Mike]
Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Rd., Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels
Grind Time rap game, remember bitches Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rolling O's, and we all be on that Kryp

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell C-Bone
Grab that cologne on out my book bag, I smell 'dro all on you, homes
Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff that you just smoked, them folks gon' trip
Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff (Arf, arf!)
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?
Cuz you just ain't gon find no yay
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy
They play dur-ty, he cain't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

[Bridge: Killer Mike]

[Hook: 2x]

[Big Boi]

[Screwed] PURPLE LABEL
So niggas want to know the story
Why the label got changed from Aquemini to Purple Ribbon, shorty?
Where Dre at man? Why isn't him and Big on TV man
Them boys still down? Organized goin' through changes
All I know is that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
[Scratched] All I know that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
[Scratched] Big here, Dre gone, moved on
Changed names from Aquemini to Purple Rib-bon
My first album slept on, failed to do a mil
But yet and still, my babies haven't missed a meal
God damn, is there a curse on Dungeon Fam?
The Goodie Mob broke up, the DF album didn't jam
Before Lil Jon had the grill in his mouth
Khujo Goodie had the dreads with the grill in his mouth
And Bubba Sparxxx gave you the phrase new south
Like Cool Breeze gave you the phrase dirty south
Is it only me? Or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggas of
Sleepy Brown back in '93?
I know its been like 12 Decembers (yeah, suttin' like that)
Let's remember "All the playas came from far and wide"
Yeah suttin' like that, talkin playalistic Cadillac
In the trap with +Two Dope Boyz+
Spittin Organized Noize via microphone
Do you believe The Source gave only gave 4 and a half microphones
They shoulda gave that a classic, ax Charlie Braxton
Damn man, I'm still amazed
The boys had the nerve to boo Big and Dre
When they hit the stage to accept the Source award
My heart dropped like a million other country boys
I thought my Mind was Playin Tricks like the Geto Boys
Damn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube
He gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school
So our mind wasn't so sick
Speakin' of being sick man I need a doctor
Which doctor? Bring back the Witch Doctor
[Scratched] Feelin' me, bring back the Witch Doctor
Feelin' me, here's an interesting fact from me
When the boy Bobby V signed with DTP
He spit about blackberry molasses over Organized beats[Big Gipp]
Look out the sun is out while its raining
The devils wife must be complaining
Remember that? its brothers work
Elbows in and up and down the court
Cause they play ball long after dark at Sykes park
Smelled the rain before it came
But that don't stop the game
Intense inside the twelve feet fence
Flip the mode back on the road set in
And watch my woodgrain spin
I let my window down and let the world in
Since I was knee high the only thing we had was the peachtree plaza in the sky
Things ain't the same no more
Everyday my city seems to grow and grow
Gotta blow a bed for my back
Cause I can't take the hardwood floors
Crooked system had me working in the warehouse
From 8 to 4 so
Gipp know what it is to work for them foes for a check that don't mean shit
More bills keep coming in
But ain't no saving
Used to scrape up a buck for a box of newports
But after I found out
That they was fucking with the tobac I stopped
Its like killing myself with a Glock (pow)
Its rough
Prices going up people giving in
To the rockets and hernon homes is known
By the city to be toxic but ain't nothin said
Always on the down low never in the mainstream
It ain't king
To be the fulltime
Blow a man these days you get years
And even though..
My cousin writes me from the pen
I always think about how we kicked it at the Dungeon fo' he went in
What's next?
My slick partner Toby is gone
Went to handle a little business never made it back home
I wonder what his girl told his son.......
Hold on

[T-Mo]
I can't escape the bullshit
Where ever I go shit
Always into something cause I wanna be rich
Pulling cards in my blood it seems I'm mean cause of my look
I might blast off on ya ass and write another book
It took too many times in the cage
Now I'm on the front page looking at myself
I'm on the run
Never to be seen by the eyes
A fugitive
Plus I got a life to live
State by state
Is this just a dream?
Sometimes it seems like it just a figure standing in the mirror from the back
That's why I'm swinging my axe
Everytime so I won't miss I can be hit
Cause I'm touchable
That's my state of mind
Cause I know one day you gotta go in a life of crime
Either the pen or a one way ticket
So I'm asking "what will it be"?
"Where do I solve"?
Nobody knows but me see
When I was a youth used to think I was bulletproof
Never thought I could be hit
Ready to stand my turf
Niggas can't understand how it work
What's the plan?
We killing our own people for this bullshit
Scared straight wanna escape theres one way outta this crooked county
With a bounty
Coming to get me
Then i'd be on the run
Hoping to find a better day without loaded guns in my face
I'm not the criminal
Fuck your probation
What's my occupation? Selling my dubbs on the street
Cause I gotta eat
Hold on

[Khujo]
Am I awake or is this just another dream?
I pinch myself invisible bars cover my cage
Done lost all conception of time
Trapped in my own mind
Unaware of the world in front or behind
Be trying
To catch up with myself
Evil doers steady working
Guest be leaching off of my wealth
Can't wait for my death
But got me fucked up
Ain't man enough
Nigga you got false nuts
Bouncing like rubber balls off the walls
The life we supposed to be living y'all
Them crackers got boxed up
We ain't even the middle men
But..yet... free my mind of confusion
Jehovah witnesses waking me up out my slumber
Using white rice and ??
Stomach aching be still hunger for the taking at the bottom of my barrel
Fuck ass! and being nice ain't got me nathan
But a frown
Too high to get down
Hold on nigga

[Cee-Lo]
You don't know me
And I ain't tryna claim I be knowing you
But I do understand what you going through
Seems like you running outta time
In and out of crime
And everybody ain't gon be able to rhyme..damn!
It must be hard to hold on when your faith is gone
Mmmm...tryna make it all alone
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and let the lord decide
You can't hide from the truth I know we've all tried
And I agree its hard to believe in what you can't see
"Well, shit nigga what you keep telling me to hold on for? I'm stuck in
The ghetto wit no where to go, I gotta slang that blow"
"You call yourself tryna teach, seems like I'm outta reach
Cause I don't wanna hear another speech
This is all I know how to get up get out and get...
...so fuck that shit!!

[Chorus]
Hold on, be strong, it ain't gon be that long
Them folks won't do you wrong
The name of the song is hold on, be strong
It ain't gon be that long
Them folks won't do you wrong
The name of the song is hold on, is hold on

Ey, now I'm chiln in the lounge and dis girl gon walk in the bathroom
She
Said "damm you look cute, but y you ain't got no tattoos?"
I said "I ain't
Come 2 look cute...cool came 2 cut!"
"and damm you look cute!, y you ain't

Pull the dro' an' I'm on probation my blunts I don't be lacin'

I'm on Kryptonite come to my crib tonight
Let me beat dat puss all night
Run tell yo buddies I fucked you right

Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets
Big Boi, he put us on

Chevy ridas, slangin' powders, Simpson Rd., Dixie Hills
Diamond pressed against dat wood, candy paint, spinnin' wheels
Grind Time rap game, remember bitches Killer Kill
Purple Ribbon rollin' o's, an' we all be on dat Kryp

I be on dat Kryptonite
Straight up on dat Kryptonite
I be on dat, straight up on dat
I be on dat Kryptonite

Time an' time again I turn back round an' tell C-Bone
Grab kurl on out my book bag, I smell dro' all on you homes
Suppose the po-po get whiff of the spliff dat you just smoke
Dem folk gon trip

Probably will cause canines
Move it the side of the road lets take a sniff
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is GBK CD
Tackle berry

So may we be on our Mary way
Cuz you just ain't gon find no yeah
Play, I got a tough team of attorneys
Make a judge lean like he sippin' syrupy
They play dirty, he can't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

I be on dat Kryptonite
Straight up on dat Kryptonite
I be on dat, straight up on dat
I be on dat Kryptonite

Straight up on dat Kryptonite
I be on dat, straight up on dat

I be on dat shit dat have you on it I don't want no mo
At dis time I'll need all my freak hoes to get down on the flo'

If you came to rep yo set break dat nigga I let 'em kno'
If it's jail I get for stompin' hats to sleep, fuck it I go
Freak I'll be off in yo sheets straight geeked swervin' down yo street
In a stolen Bonneville wit 23's on the feet

Collection while he do brown, back in town to do re-bag
Give me face, I love the sound slap the taste they hit the ground
Back in the A hooked up, clicked up wit sum people dat don't play
On dat Kryptonite stay so high we might fly away
