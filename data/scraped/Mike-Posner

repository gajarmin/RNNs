[Verse 1]
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away
Oh baby
Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

[Chorus]
Sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?

[Verse 2]
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
Cause girl you're hotter than the Southern California Bay
Never wanna play no games, you don't gotta  be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No make-up on, that's my sugar

[Chorus 2x][Hook: Mike Posner]
I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
All these haters really love me, they just pretend that they don't
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
In my zone, zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
In my zone, zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
When I'm in my, when I'm in my
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh - in my zone

[Verse 1: Rittz]
In my old school bumpin' that "Kiss of Life" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And now it's real and they say the limit is the sky
But my feet set on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it cause, when it rained, it poured
But now the storms finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind
Still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest alley, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You can say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my Famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
Cause what awaits for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, filled my cid-up with straight
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rittz]
This ain't no ordinary love
I was sick of being poor and said "enough"
Right up 85 North and there I was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia, I'm feeling the support
Spread the word cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing out the torch I carry
I ignore them every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
And my jewelry blinds, I got stupid style
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts, I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
I got the black sea bass and the lobster bisque
And took a shot of whiskey to the dome
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown, I'm in my... zone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular, Batmobile look like Dracula
Giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
You catching feelings, I think you squarer than Madison, I'm-
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Mike Posner]
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, in my zone
Zo-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, in my zone[Produced by No I.D.]

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was "bye" more, "fuck you"
"Who is that" and "I don't know why" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]

[Outro]
So don't tell me you love me
Whatever you do whatever you do[Verse 1]
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby take a chance or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three two

[Pre Hook]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Hook]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t never wanna fight yeah, you already know
I am ‘ma a make you shine bright like you’re laying in the snow
Burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the —- world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and
Voice goin crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
Swaggie

[Pre Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
So give me a chance, ‘cause you’re all I need girl
Spend a week wit your boy I’ll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man, I’d never leave you girl
I just want to love you, and treat you right

[Hook][Verse 1]
Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are"

[Verse 2]
They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are"

[Bridge]
If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26
I spoke to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]

Be as you are[Verse 1]
When we first met I was just a Sophomore
We spent the night on Lydia’s couch
I didn't know you were gonna break my heart then
I didn't know the pain I’d feel right now

[Hook]
And I smiled, yes I smiled
But underneath are memories
That I’m trying, yeah I’m trying
To let go

[Chorus]
But it’s not that simple
Type of Misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine

[Verse 2]
People used to say I didn't deserve you
I was cool with that, cause I felt the same
But then they played my song on the radio
And I don’t think you liked who I became

[Hook]
And so you left, yeah you left
On someone else's arm now
And I’m trying, yeah I’m trying to let go

[Chorus]

(Used to be mine)

[Bridge]
Cause baby your beauty marks
Are like shooting stars
And my goofy heart is one of cupids darts
I’m just a nervous guy
And these words of mine
Will reverse the time
To when you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuz it’s not that simple
Type of Misery
All these mixed up signals

[Chorus][Hook: Niykee Heaton]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Now I just feel like I'm gonna win
Whole mid-west side, that's my kin
Beneath your beautiful that's my pen
You trying to get dope but I just am
I was born with it, did a tour with it
Them overseas girls always give you more digits
I've been blessed, I done went shore to shore with it
Now trying to help a couple kids do more with it
Got some plaques on the wall and I'm still dope
I'm just trying to show the people that there's still hope
You buy a album and we serve up a meal bro
The label's like "That's gonna cost you a mill bro"
So big, God told me to
And momma don't believe in that but I know it's true
We came to spread a little love that's what we gonna do
Finally Famous in the house that's the only crew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T. Mills]
I bought it, I own it
You borrow, I loan it
I got people rocking clothes with my fucking name on it
She said "Milli do your thing"
So I built a stage on it, now my bed rocking
Rocking like one of my shows
All she wearing is perfume, she love my cologne
And I been waiting on my moment what feel like forever
But the more I think about it shit it's probably better
Cause I keep working, I keep grinding, I keep writing, I keep rhyming
I'mma turn a single stone into a pile of diamonds
I remember when I didn't have the funds to buy shit
Holla if that's something that you can identify with
But now I drop a grip on the jeans
And now I drop your rent on some weed
And now I'm making love on your sheets
I'm in your worst nightmare and in your girlfriend's dreams
Wake up, hello, tell me what you see
I'm a skinny motherfucker like six foot three
I said fuck a weight room, I was selling CD's
Getting more pussy than the whole football team
I was born in Riverside and I'm still that
Yeah I heard your new shit and it's still wack
Every time we get together you gonna feel that
This summer and the next, I'mma kill that, Mills

[Hook: Mike Posner & Niykee Heaton]

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
I got them wetter than a Vilbrequin youngest of the champions
Beach house music, cue the dark pads and violins
Clear glass out in Malibu with all my friends
Me, Mike Pos, the Mills, and Niykee for the win
I'm growing up I gotta buzz call it motivation
Blowing up like iPhone push notifications
Priceless if I had it back I wouldn't change a thing
It's far from over so I tell the fat lady sing
And she hitting the notes and I'm starting to feel
Like I can't sit in coach cause I get fucking killed
Oh, I own it, oh oh, I'm on it
Cold like Winterfell I Game of Throne it
Hold it, hold it, did anybody notice
They all in the D now, Beantown we own it
Shouts to the D.O. Beantown we roll it
Yeah me and my Gs and we own it, yeah Sammy

[Hook: Niykee Heaton]

[Hook: Mike Posner][Hook]
Aye, aye, aye
Around the world and back in 21 days
Ay, ya, ya
And everywhere I go you always ask me why
Can't you just stay a little bit longer?
Can't you just stay one more night, right?
Can't you just stay a little bit longer?
I don't know how you live your life
Me either

[Verse One]
The girls love
They see me stuntin on Ellen, Kathy Lee & Regis
The heads love me
Cause my flow way better than all the MC's is
You should be ashamed
You don't even know that you're loosing (stupid)
The shoes you wore in your video
I wear them shits to hoop in
I do it like
Get in the plane, walk in the plane, get off the plane, and go
Do it the same, every day, I'm gonna play my own
I don't know why, every night, them girls be trying to bang
I'm just tryna to do my thang, like

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I used to be your favorite rapper's favorite singer
Before I had my plaques
Now I'm the only singer that your favorite rapper's scared of
Cause I burn them on the track
I know you've seen my video
Your girl got my shit on replay
And that shit that you wore in yours
That's for my mothafuckin' PJs
Like, get in the plane, ride in the plane, every single night
Step on the stage, I'm gonna raise, every hand inside
I don't know why, every night, them girls be trying to bang
I'm just tryna to do my thang, like

[Hook]

Uh huh, alright, uh, the heads like the uh
But the girls they like when I do that, alright
Close the doorShe puts on her best dress her closet can provide her
It ain't much but she makes it work
And he puts on the best cologne
His paycheck can provide him
It ain't much but it'll take the work
And they talked about nothing for a while
Lip stick on a Corona
He decides he loves her right there
But she can't understand, no

And it was almost beautiful
It was almost beautiful

She takes off her best dress
He helps her with the back zip
But he seems a little bit too good at them
She rethinks the whole thing put back on her jacket
Left em she was never to good at it
He wonders if he said something wrong
He was never a smooth talker
And he decided he hates her right there
So he rolls up a joint

Hook

We're all searching for some place to disappear(to disappear)
We're all searching for some place to disappear(to disappear)

Hook x2

Fucking bird chirping this whole song
Shut up![Verse 1:]
Cameras flashing
Spot lights getting hot on me like
Turn this suntan to ashes
And you cannot match it
I done blew up
And covered the competition in volcanic ashes
Let us trend the fashion new clothes a plus
Yelawolf changed my life so much it chokes me up
You talk about me when I was broke and
He gave me the hope I lost
And now I'm gone on the road so much
And I know you're lonely love
I just wish we could touch through the phone but just
Stay focused and note that I'm trying to make a living for the both of us
And when the chuckle up
I might close enough to finally buy us a car
With her own apartment he embark a dream
On stage in saw to rin
A shy town thinking that you'll get drunk and screams
I'm a feel like a sailor of a sicker submarine
Tryin to keep both of our heads above the water
I know you want kids but we live with your mom
How the fuck am I supposed to become a father
When I'm spending my last hundred dollars on studio time
But you ain't ever gave a fuck about bread
I'm a give you the life you deserve one day
While you crying all alone in our bed
I'm on the bus and the bunk
Having dreams barbequing with a back yard for the dog to run
Been gone so long it feels weird talking on the phone
I freaking knew it I be coming home
Fuck rap, you're my backbone
When I'm at home with you it's like I'm really in my comfort zone
A thousand miles away looking at the sky and pray
And tell God you ain't all alone

[Hook:] (Mike Posner)
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be

[Verse 2:]
Fights on facebook
All you see these pics they took with me
You can't believe the hype
Every night we fight about girls you see
On the internet, thinking I'm cheating
And I gotta defend myself from bullshit you accused me
You play gotta do music though
Think I'm all late tripping getting groupie love
Crying to me is unnecessary
Losing you is the last thing I want
If only you could trust, then I'd miss you as much as you miss me
And I wish we could be on the couch together
But we ain't got no cheddar
No kind of credit history can we deserve better
Can't accept the mysery I know you had a real hard life
And it's harder when I'm gone
And I promise you one day shit will make sense
It will be alright
I sent flowers to your job today
I put my headphones on and I played our song
No I mean the bicycles I just got done
Sorry that you had to wait up long
So many nights when we get up on each other
Really fighting cause I can't come home
Got a hotel room just to face time with you tonight
Don't put make up on
Because your face just looks so beautiful
And I promise that I'm always gonna be true to you
So many people travelling in pursue of true love
But never get the feeling that I do from you
So many human beings tryin live their whole life with their soulmate
But I found mine
While you laid up in the house crying
We both been counting on time

[Hook:]
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
You've got your head in the clouds
The stars in your eyes
Everyone can see it but you
And I don't know how
You believe your own lies
No one wants to tell you the truth

[Hook: Mike Posner]
It's just a matter of time
Before this all comes crashing down
The harder you try
The more we can see the real you
The real, real you

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
So you're gonna be a big star
They told you you're the next big thing
Everybody's gonna love you
Everybody's gonna know your name

[Hook: Mike Posner]
So push your problems in your impending fame
And push 'em away, push 'em away
Keep your head up, baby, wait for the day
They'll see that you're larger than life

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
You know that you're special
You probably hear it everyday
You know you don't belong here
With normal people doing normal things

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Hook: Mike Posner] [x2][Hook]
She loves me, she loves me not
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh, you like me?
What the hell does that mean?
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not?

[Verse 1 - Mike Posner]
Maybe I'm just dumb
But I can't read the signals that you're givin'
And I can never tell
If you're looking at me or Clinton
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?
Or do you wanna come back and stay up
All night, all night, all night with me?

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big Sean]
Baby, what's your favorite drinks?
I think I'mma buy a round of 'em all
I'm rollin' up the bestest
Come help me blow a pound of it all
I'm on that up-upper echelon
You should climb up and be down with it all
Come here, cause we go hand in hand
Like (*clap clap clap*), round of applause
Showtime bitch, action
I think it's time for that night scene
She go to sleep and dream about my sex
I guess it's a pipe dream
28, but I make her feel like she 19
Tryna stick around like wifey
But I send her home in my white T like
"Bye"

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Clinton Sparks]
Now, every time I see this girl
She be askin' all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to
And who is it I'm hanging with?
Can't ever tell if she into me
Or just wanna be a friend to me
Mixed signals she's sending me
Late night at the club, drunk texted me
Like, "Can I come over your house?"
Okay, but can I come over your mouth?
Smiley face, LOL
Back and forth, I can't tell
Without being conspicuous
So (don't be so ambiguous girl)

[Hook][Verse One]
I went to school with Maria, the other day I seen her
Dancing up and down on the pole
When I was smoking on sativa
She was a cheerleader
What happened to her? Nobody knows
Got me feeling like an asshole
I got it perfect, and I don’t know
If I deserve it
And when I’m on stage, I see a memory
It fucks me up cause, it could have been me
And they say she’s on the class a team
Stuck in her day dream
Been this way since 18, but lately
Her face seems, slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries and they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Hook]
Cause we’re just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
She don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in her pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
And it’s too cold outside
For angels to fly, for angels to fly

[Verse Two]
I ain’t spoken to my best friend in over two years
It’s fucked up cause he’s addicted to them pills
And he’s fucked up
Not too long ago, we was on the come up
Your two best friends got signed, no such luck
See you was in the group with Sean
When he was still Sean The Don
And we was all just tryin' not to wake up my mom
But Kanye didn’t want you
A couple years later then I got signed too
You always felt like we didn’t do enough for you
If you done been patient, we could make more moves
And now I’m hearing stories
I know your two best friends just living our your dreams
I love you Pat
I love you Pat
I feel like I let you down and there ain’t no fucking drug for that
Here we go, here we go

[Hook]
Cause we’re just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
He don’t wanna go outside tonight
And in the pipe he flies to the motherland
Get ? from the pusher man
And it’s too cold outside
For angels to fly, for angels to fly[Mike Posner]
[Hook]
Why do fine girls always have attitudes?
You say one thing wrong, they get mad at you
You try and loosen them up with a glass or two
Why do fine girls always have attitudes, attitudes, yeah

My friends back home, always ask me:
"Mike, why you date no supermodels?"
Well, the truth is that they're too damn skinny and
Always order big ol' bottles, of Cristal, fuck that
No necklaces, I got a one track mind
They can't figure out why
Somebody tell me

[Hook]

My friends back home always ask me:
"Mike, why you date no actresses?"
Well, I banged a few, but all they ever do is
Talk 'bout being actresses
And I don't care, about your job
Who your co-star is, go suck his cock
Cause it doesn't make a difference to me, no
I need a down chick

[Casey Veggies]
A long flight, she was in the middle
Met a model chick on the plane
She was thinkin' 'bout gettin' some sleep and
I was thinkin' 'bout gettin' some brain
I was starin' all at her ass when I forgot to ask her name
That's a shame, I'm a dog, need to be tamed, gimme a call
Said her favorite song last year was "Blame It On that Alcohol"
At the bar, before the flight, gettin' shots, feelin' right
At the end of the day, she realize I'm a young nigga just livin' life
You get it right, I spend a stack or two
Her attitude determine latitude, like, (like, like, like)

[Hook][Verse One: Mike Posner]
Yes I know it's been too long
Probably seems I'm always gone
Still don't know where I belong
Wrote this song
Heaven just a plane away
I know my mom, she can't wait
When I feel I've lost my way
I go home, home, home

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Back home
Back home
Back home
Home
Back home

[Verse Two: Mike Posner]
It doesn't feel too much changed
I still get called my government name
Everything still feels the same
Back home, home, home

[Hook]

[Interlude: Mike Posner talking]
Aye. Ladies and gentlemen we have a very special guest with us today. He goes by the name of King Chip

[Verse Three: King Chip]
Either Hopkins or Burke Lakefront
When I touch down we gon' blaze up
We gon' sleep late when we wake up
We gon' crash tomorrow to get away from
Them bad vibes that you call me 'bout
And all them problems you was talkin' 'bout
Man, I really wish Hawk was 'round
And I ain't seen my dawgs in way too long
I can never get use to being away from home
Let me get a haircut, got to pull to roots
Thornhill Drive, yeah these my roots
I remember hittin' Tower City on that Rapid
Now I got a store in Tower City, how that happen?
Never thought Cleveland would be a place I'd visit
But when you from the Midwest man ain't nothin' given

[Hook][Verse 1]
Virginia Woolf and poetry
No one seemed to notice me
Being young was getting so old
Cheap beer and cigarettes
Life was like a movie set
And I seemed to be given no role

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 18
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
Life is not always a comfortable ride
Everybody's got scars that they hide
And everybody plays the fool sometimes, yeah
Just be as you are"

[Verse 2]
They played me on the radio
And everything was changing, so
I thought I was all the way grown
But I can still remember in that cold November
When I realized I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 22
I cried to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]
"There are moments when you fall to the ground
But you are stronger than you feel you are now
You don't always have to speak so loud, no
Just be as you are
It doesn't matter if you become some star
Life is better when you open your heart
You don't always have to act so hard, no
Just be as you are"

[Bridge]
If I'm speaking truthfully
I'm not who I used to be
And I know some people might laugh
Cause my music doesn't sound the same
And my head's no longer shaved
I'm worried if I'm on the right path

[Pre-Chorus]
But in times of trouble
I can turn to my mother
And I know that she gon' understand
So at age 26
I spoke to my mother
And she told me, "young man"

[Chorus 2]

Be as you are[Verse 1:Wale]
Uh! If I ain't ready to listen I'm never gonna listen
Most follow intuition while they wishing it would work
And my vision isn't perfect so I will never learn for it
Don't wish for some change like a church worker
Hallelujah, preacher I am not influenced
If I don't donate to your movement am I not improving?
And while the poor kill the poor for a portion
A piece of American society pie
I get high, the munchies I got so bear witness
I got this girl looking at you cause my reps kissing muah!
And I ain't ready to wait when there's dollars on the brain
Why would you expect

[Bridge:Wale]
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing

[Hook:Mike Posner]
Yes I know it's been too long
Probably seems I'm always gone
Still don't know where I belong
Wrote this song
Heaven just a plane away
I know my mom, she can't wait
When I feel I've lost my way
Back home

[Verse 2:2 Chainz]
I said baby I’m ready, I got work on the Scale-y (Scale-y)
Still got it maid like I stayed at the telly!
OK, I know that you fear me
I won’t come down ‘til you feel it
Put your back in the flo', put your feet near the ceiling!
Now you know I’m the realest gotta handle my bidness
You got your girl on lock, I pay her conjugal visits
You know my campaign, I support strippers
Got a table of ones, I use pyrex for my dishes (TRUUU)
OK, I've been on my job, and they switched the position
Yeah, I got my ends up and it’s just the beginning!
You say you do it, I did it, and you know that I’m with it
I got a bitch in your city, that got a bitch in yo city!

[Bridge:Mike Posner]
It doesn't feel too much changed
I still get called my government name
Everything still feels the same
Still don't know where I belong

[Verse 3:Ludacris]
Listen, look I got feed my family by all means necessary
Cause paychecks are comin' up shorter than February
Can't get a real job, I never finished school
Can't get no new clothes, I wore the same tennis shoes
But now the game's changed, I'm all about the hustle
And even Hogan Knows Best, I'm all about the muscle
I'm all about my team, I'm all about my green
I'm 'bout supply and demand, I'm 'bout to serve the fiends
And I'm a workin dream, I keep the circuit clean
See I'm the FUCKIN FUTURE~! I'm a workin machine
Don't trust a soul,I turn 20 into 50
50 to a hundred and a hundred to a Bentley
A Bentley to a building and a building to a 'scraper
Can't keep up with the news but I get that Daily Paper
And youse a daily hater cause my foot game is major
After a while, crocodile, see you later alligator

[Bridge:Wale]
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing
Huh singing.X3[Intro: Mike Posner] [x3]
Uh

[Hook:The Knocks']
Passed out waiting for your rescue
Last night had me in the best mood
You say we had a conversation
All I remember is

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
My friends took my cell phone
And drunk dialed Miley Cyrus
I don't know what they said to her
She's rich, she'll get over it
Hello strange lady
I'm not sure if we banged
You look fine in the sunlight
Please don't ask me your name
All I remember is

[Hook: The Knocks'] [x2]

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
You said you were an actress
But I didn't believe you
I guess you need a practice
Cause I didn't believe you
Hello strange lady
I don't know if we banged
You look fine in the sunlight
Just please don't ask me your name
All I remember is

[Hook (x2)]

[Bridge: Mike Posner] [x3]
Red, red cups

All I remember is

[Hook: Mike Posner & The Knock's]

Last night had me in the best mood
You say we had a conversation
But all I remember is[Intro]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl

[Mike Posner]
I hear you knock knock knock baby come on up
I hope you got got got something in yo' cup

Don't tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you gon' do

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this
Bow chicka wow wow

Break it down, dicky down down
Girl don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'mma make it sound like
I'mma make it sound like

[Mike Posner]
Are you tryna make me wait wait wait 'til the second day
But I can't can't can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy
You've been playin hard to get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want right
Don't tell me what you wanna do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Lil Wayne]
I got a leather couch and a black mic
And we all alone, what it sound like?
The night was dead, we found life
I know I talk shit, but it sound right
You say you can't but that's unfair
Gotta give something, something gotta give
I bet you love it, I win the bet
Now we laying up, cigarettes

[Mike Posner]
Now, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl you know you like that
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl you know you like that

[Hook: Mike Posner]

[Outro]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over girl[Verse 1]
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby take a chance or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three two

[Pre Hook]
I’d like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you

[Hook]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don’t
I could be your Buzz Lightyear, fly across the globe
I don’t never wanna fight yeah, you already know
I am ‘ma a make you shine bright like you’re laying in the snow
Burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the —- world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl and
Voice goin crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
Swaggie

[Pre Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
So give me a chance, ‘cause you’re all I need girl
Spend a week wit your boy I’ll be calling you my girlfriend
If I was your man, I’d never leave you girl
I just want to love you, and treat you right

[Hook][Hook: Mike Posner]
Now as I seen more money, there's more problems
Every time I look around
They say I'm not hungry and I lost it
But you're never gonna, ever gonna, ever gonna bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me down
Bring me down, you not gon' bring me

[Verse One: Big Sean]
Look, I need the best drinks, I love the best hoes
I roll the best weed and blow the best smoke
Mama, they love me from NY head back to Fresno
But they tryna bring your son down like the West Coast
Still instrumental on top of these instrumentals
I can say that we the same, but it's too hard to pretend to
You ain't been through what I been through bitch
(Been through what I been through)
Man, I charge it to the game/It's cool I got my incidentals
Bitch! I'm doin' everything I planned to
I'm with a girl that's just too much for you to handle
My mans will squeeze the handle and put you on a mantel
Respect a nigga doin everything that you can't do, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Freddie Gibbs]
D-d-down
Yeah clown, another one of them gangsta verses
Woulda put it down sooner but I was outtta town lookin' fo a couple thangs to purchase
Needed the money for the shopping malls, so I was robbin' dawg, had to snatch chains and purses
Comin' off too thug for the radio cause really though I just can't restrain from cursin'
Clip for the tips, and a blunt for the skunk
25 to life charged in my trunk
Gotta keep a strap in my city to straight dump
The fo ten turn grown men to straight punks
Turn kings to straight fiends, good girls; straight hoes
Took it to the street wit dope and straight flows
Told 'em that the game is sold and not told
Bag it up and then I'm servin' rocks
Kept my grandma's house so hot
Mo' money, mo' problems dawg, but I'd rather deal with the problems that Puffy got
Don't wanna be strugglin' like my dad/Take a look back at this life I had
The hood I threw up so when I grew up I knew I'd be Jordan, Michael, Brad

[Hook][Verse 1]
I’m a writer and a lover
I’m a Midwest music man
And I’ve been to a lot of places
But I’m gon’ end where I began
I took class in Carolina
Got high smoking joints
And now they know my name in Paris

[Hook]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, and my father’s father too
I used to live in New York City
But baby that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 2]
I don’t claim to be a prophet
I just speak my mind
I try to tell it like it is
And sometimes God makes it rhyme

I like my songs how I like my women
Honest and to the point
You see I got fucked up in Stockholm

[Hook]
But I’ll be buried in Detroit
Next to my father, my father’s father too
Had a spot in New York City
But baby that ain’t no substitute
Not for my hometown
That place people avoid
I’ve made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in Detroit

[Verse 3]
You know I ain’t gon’ live forever
Baby it won’t be long
At the wake they’ll say “He made a lot of mistakes
But he could write hell of a song”

And I made, I made killing
Though I never really was employed
I had a girl from San Diego

[Hook]
But I’ll be buried in
I killed a show in Indonesia
But I’ll be buried in
I made love in every city
But I’ll be buried in DetroitBenzi! Play that shit

Alright, Diplo, Ah
Guess who's biz-ack?
Pose not Paws
Don't call me that
Let me close that one time, this is nothing and everything all at the same time
When did I become an asshole? Ah
Don't answer that, leave a dime on the fifth
I can handle that
Lower eight will do
Fuck I'll take a 5 she got big boobs, (alright)
I'm sorry if the last line was offensive
But fuck it though, I meant it

She likes gold, she likes plat
I got a couple bucks I can get that
But I like ray and I like black, I chameleon, I can match that

I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah

That's why I'm never gonna try to be an actor
DMX used to be my favorite rapper
I'm just trying to be the same as I used to
But it's hard when they all tryna use you
So let me pull the brakes, slow down
Is it cool if I come back soon, cause I'm just tryna take a little break
Didn't think so, let me think though
I don't wanna play it back like Ringo
He just hit em with the Bone Thugs mix
Mixed with the he can really kinda sing flow, oh

I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I, I, got a pocket full of sunshine
I, I, wanna share it with you
I, I got a pocket full of sunshine
I, I, wanna share it with you. (uh)

It's the Pose and Benzi Show
That was one take!
Do I get a prize for that or something?
Fuck man, there's no love for me[Intro: Clinto Sparks Talking]
Ladies and gentelman
My name is Clinton Sparks
His name is Mike Posner
Say hello ladies

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Goodbye to the old me
Goodbye to the minutes n seconds n hours
Hello to the new me
I like how this feels

[Hook: Mike Posner]
So close the door
Close the door(hey)
Close the door
Close the door(hey)

[Interlude: Clinton Sparks Talking]
You know something
You know what feels good
If feels good now a days
When I walk into a store
And the lady comes up to me and says
"Let me show you what's on sell"
And I look at her square in her eyes and I say
"How about you show me what's not on sale?"
Lady this ain't '97 anymore
This the new me
Matter of fact, let me buy you a better looking outfit when you talk to me
This ain't when I used to live in my truck
Trucks live with me now
Look at my house, they hang all around my place"
Oh it feels so good
I wish I could express how great this feels
Talk to 'em Mike

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Goodbye to the old me
Goodbye to the minutes n seconds n hours
Hello to the new me
I like how this feels

Thank you all, for gettin familiar

Get Familiar[Verse One: Cris Cab]
She keeps it on the top shelf
All of her makeup and disguises, what they’re seeing
Not too confident with herself
She can’t take it, always had a funny feeling
Nobody wants to fall apart, she tries to be somebody
They said she could never be
To find out what’s inside her heart
She’s still searching for identity

[Hook: Cris Cab]
Yesterday’s come and gone
Your actions always follow you
Don’t matter what you’ve done
They see your colors shining true
They see your colors shining true
They see your colors shining true

[Verse Two: Mike Posner]
There’s nothing on the top floor
Black car, yellow diamonds, triple beaming
Keeps the purple in the Swisher, Swisher
They say they love his brown eyes, they don’t mean it
Go rogue cause he thought it was cool
Yellow Tail, no ? for a party of two
They say he’s on them red pills and it’s probably true
But it’s fucked, all that green never got him as blue

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Cris Cab]
Every single day you’ve got to find your way
The sun is setting but at least you stood your ground today
And when the pressure’s on, and all your friends are gone
Oh, look at you shine
Life moves quickly, sometimes you lose track
By the time you turn 50, you don’t wanna look back
Everybody get with me, Miami’s where I’m at
Let me see you throw your hands in the sky

[Hook][Intro]
Been around the world many times
Seen many things
And they in color too
Seen women so beautiful
That I could die with a smile on my face
And not feel like the good lord gypped me
(The space between love and me
Between...)

[Verse 1]
How you expect to have an ordinary relationship
With such an extraordinary nigga
Yea there's flaws in what you figured
Ain't the liquor that got you considering calling up the sitter
Telling her you need a couple hours and of course you tip her
I like my fantasies, half stripper half glass slipper
Wrappin' one like a riddle with enigma
Character in my flip book
Coming to life when I'm flipping through the pictures
Switching up the positions
My karma karma chameleon
Change colors with the surroundings
I can hear you with my eyes and I'm loving the way you sound
And I'm smothering and I'm grindin'
Now [?] is counting me out
Loving in public when we coming and
Up against the cupboard til we...
(Look like turquoise)
Right on the couch
(Yellow on the bad day)
Knocking it out without a doubt

[Hook] x2
(Colors of you)
'Eyo the world is my coloring book
Look, new discoveries every time
When I color outside the lines

[Verse 2]
(Color of you)
My self expression
Acquire every color in the spectrum
My self reflection make the light change direction
When you see it from this angle the colour, the cut the clarity
Starts bringing me down that's the depravity of gravity
Having me in my blue phase
Go off the grid for a few days
Go on a journey without a suitcase
The security of obscurity in a world of respect
And I'm trading it like a currency
Currently you soft as a mallet hitting a xylophone
He so yella I'm wishin' his fella right his wrong
But naw, instead he is synthetic as styrofoam
Recite a poem so monotone that they monochrome
My light'll poke through the clouds
We'll take you higher like you smoking the loud
While I provide the dope kaleidoscope of sound
You can see it with your ears
You can hear it with your eyes
You can feel it right here yea

[Bridge]
(Colors of you)
You don't look like turquoise
You don't look like gold
You don't look like purple
That'll match your hue

[Hook] x2[Mike Posner] [Hook]
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so fake
You probably think that this song is about you, don't you?

You got your high brow, switchin' your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise, shh
See, I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Girl, you're so vain
You probably think that this song is about you, don't you?

[Hook]

[Big Sean]
Now don't you dare act like you don't know
Know what's up, cause your nose is up
When I'm approachin' up, pshht, yup
Like I can give you winter in the summer
Or summer in the winter, Miami in December
Tryna look bored in them Dior
She probably is
Was actin' shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. Primadonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer
Sean, yup

[Mike Posner]
Cause it's your scene, (it's your scene)
I got no doubt
We all see
You got your head in the clouds

[Hook]
