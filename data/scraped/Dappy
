[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Girl you should come to my house
Big face Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big face Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it

[Verse 1: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Look at you, look at me stocking these clothes
I ain't even turned up yet, I ain't gone home
If I do I'm putting on a suit and turning up in a Cayman, driving around
Oh na na, they salute when they see, I came in surfing around
I can get the honeys in the road
Look at you, look at me still in these clothes
I ain't even been to sleep yet
I've been doing late night shifts, 10 hours in a show, they all grinding it out
Oh they won't understand, when I'm in the booth and I'm high in the cloud

[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Girl you should come to my house
Big faced Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I've been getting money like a dope dealer, on the low grinding all week
Bought some new clothes upon a Tuesday, wore the same fit all week-end
Hand one bitch, she brought three friends
I ain't gotta fake or gotta pretend
Great White when it comes to R&B hits
We couldn't park there, probably get a precinct
I've been counting on the Washington's
Lincoln's and the Jackson's, Franklin's  and the Benjamin's
I done hear some ladies talk a little, little vanilla in em
Mix it with some cinnamon, abum don't drop, I'ma still eat
Living through the hundreds, call it blue cheese

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
I've been getting Grammys on the low
You be in the club singing all my shit
You ain't even know I wrote all em other niggas songs
I cannot blame you, who does their homework
They don't check credits any more
I don't be trippin', I just head to the bank and the bars in the morn'
I would be foolish to take al this money, take pictures and post on the ground, nigga
I really do this, I don't have to prove it to you, niggas know who I am
So you can trick on them hoes if you wanna
But your cheque gon' be gone in the morning
While I'm sitting on a private beach
Just me and my girl in the private suite, nigga

[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
I've been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
Casue I've been getting money on the low

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
I've been getting money on the low
Phone on silent, ringing hitters outside
Since I've been doing well, said I left her in a drought
Don't let me R. Kelly in your house, I can really take the piss with it
See I'm the one in front of six digits
Froggy style, make her quick ribbit
Said she like a cool nigga with a big business
I got an ice bucket challenge on my wrist, innit
Gorgeous like my other chick Zara
She got the vibes but she's never been to Gaza
And she look better on a bottle than a sparkler
And now like funny tummy, yeah I got the last laugh
Girl [?], I pulled up in a Phantom, listening to Buju Banton
I can boom bye bang em if I want
The woman and my clothes don't be clashing
Cause they're both so Italian
I run diesel by the gallon when I [?]

[Verse 5: Dappy]
I keep it 100 even when i'm down to zero
So tell your don scarface he's no Al Pacino
This ain't a movie so watch who you're watching
And that shit you're rocking
Cause I might have to rob it like De Niro
We never cut corners cause we lean on em like Ducati's
You be stuck in traffic busting swishers on the cabbies
Me I got all these foreign bitches screaming "Are you Dappy?"
Cause I be making money from London to Abu Dhabi
So what a blow, this is that straight off the bub flow
Call it cargo, fuck you and that half fro
I'm still to introduce you to the real Pablo
Said she don't love ya, I bet she'll love how fast your car goes
Let's get it right, in life you have to handle shit proper
Everything you see is all me, I would never borrow
They ain't letting me spray what I really wanna say
Cause at any stage they could drop me like Madonna
Then I'd really have to make money on the low

[Hook: Angel]
Money on the low, girl you should come to my house
Big face Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big face Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it[Intro]
I keep it 100
I keep it 100 oh
You know I always keep it one hundred right?
I keep it 100
You ain't gotta worry about shhhh
I keep it 100

[Verse 1]
I thought that you’d give up
When all we had was us
I can’t even lie, even lie to ya
I'm sorry it ain't my fault
I run out of all my trust
I went through hell and back
To get it back
That’s why every day I thank the lord
You ain't just with me for money
Cos you keep on giving without taking nothing from me
I remember all the times when I was low
And you never let go
(Oh no)

[Pre-Hook]
I'm just being honest with you oh
You could be down and out
But it won’t matter
Just call for back up
And I will always come through oh oh
You don’t need nobody else
It’s me and you against the world

[Hook]
Cos I was built for this
So forget about my previous
When I say I'm being serious
I'm too real for this
I feel to run and tell everyone
As if I’ll find anyone as good as this
As good as this
You know I'm built for, for you
See I
I keep it

[Verse 2]
So the only thing that matters
Is you can always count on me
Cos you know I keep it one hundred
And I have done right from the start
This time round I won’t let you down
Cos you and I were a part of me
That’s hand on heart
So tell me if there’s anything I could do to make it better
Let me know a way I could take away any of the pressure
Now if ever you feel low
Just know that I’ll never let go
(Oh no)

[Pre-Hook]
Cos I'm just being honest with you oh
You could be down and out
But it won’t matter
Just call for back up
And I will always come through oh oh
You don’t need nobody else
It’s me and you against the world

[Hook x2]
Cos I was built for this
So forget about my previous
When I say I'm being serious
I'm too real for this
I feel to run and tell everyone
As if I’ll find anyone as good as this
As good as this
You know I'm built for, for you
See I

I was built for this

[Bridge]
Now tell me who do you love?
Even though I haven’t made it easy
You think I've come this far just to give up?
Hell no
Cos what it is
What it is
What it is
What it is

[Hook x2]
Cos I was built for this
So forget about my previous
When I say I'm being serious
I'm too real for this
I feel to run and tell everyone
As if I’ll find anyone as good as this
As good as this
You know I'm built for, for you
See I

[Outro]
I keep it 100
I keep it 100
I keep it 100
I keep it 100[Verse 1]
You say you wanna love me, you say I'm just a fake
You say I'm just another one that never had your back
Do you feel my presence? Maybe I should go
Maybe I'm another that you need to let go
See one day if you let me I will try and mend this broken past
Yeah, my heart will save us cause I am never giving up on us

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you love me you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
Cause if you need me you should have never pushed me away

[Chorus]
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you'll never see
Cause I see
The beautiful me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya

[Verse 2]
They say that I'm a liar cause I'm from an estate
But what you say behind my back you know I'll say it your face
I wish we could let bygones be bygones and so on and fire on
For you I swear I'll catch another case

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I weren't brought up round money so I didn't know how to treat it
I helped everyone round me and spent it all just when I needed it
I made a mil' and splashed it, did it all again
This time round, can't even trust myself, let alone my friends
If I'm the man why they don't play me no more?
That can't be fair right?
Just don't get it cause I'm on their side
I wish they wore these Nikes, took a hike to see what it's like in my spare time
And then come back and tell me that I deserve to lose all my air time

[Chorus] (x2)[Intro:]
(Rapper Dappy has been at it again, getting himself into trouble)
(Rushed and evasive, N-Dubz lead singer Dappy fights his way into Guildford Crown Court)
(He's written a rap and made a video, he's called it Tarzan 2)
(As the rapper hugs tearful fans after avoiding prison)
(He added Dappy had learnt a very important lesson indeed)
(It's easy, you can talk about my fame as facts that you know about me
I'm in the public eye)
(I hate it but I'm a good person
I got a good heart, I got morals)
(Paparazzi, I'm filming you guys for once
Say something for my camera man)
(Interlude)
Shout out to Diego and my brother M.A.Z.E Revenge

[Verse:]
Yup! Versace Versace, I’ll lick down a hater cause I ain’t Gianni
If my kids want a bike well it’s only right I bring back a Ferrari
I bet, you didn’t know that the 20 gold chains ‘round my neck
I could swap 'em for property (I swapped that shit)
Cause when you skip jail and splash money in Mayfair, that’s real life Monopoly
If you think your baby mama’s a bitch, think again mine’s a monstrosity
Well she’s only pissed I treat all of my bitches equally, call it democracy
All of these hoes think because they cook and clean for me they can just climb up on top of me
Bitch my dick is a ticket so because of that I’d rather you swallow the lottery
We used to rock Nikes and hoodies and scarves round our face
To keep low in the manor
But now its Versace Versace, Armani, Cavalli, Dolce and Gabbana
See I am in touch with a feminine side
And your mum is a piff, yeah I bet I could bang her
So Versace Versace, these fools want a piece of me but I ain’t Montana
You can hustle all you want but my bars hold weight
Put 'em on your scales, that shit will break
That reptile around your waist is a snake
Cos she keeps on tryna fuck me like she wants to catch a case; that’s rape
What's up when you’ll be spending all your money on silicon handbags and all type of pedicures
But she’s call me Papi with tats on her body the thing is
That’s my name instead of yours
My neighbour’s a pussy, he thinks that I’m cocky
I’m young with a house worth a million
He tells me to turn down the music
Instead I have a rave right in my living room
Catch me in Dubai or on the street in Ibiza
Four bad bitches hanging out my 2-seater
When you too busy in the ends sweating in a cab
All the depression is not around me
Its Versace Versace Versace
I walk in Versace and leave in Versace
Then I went and got Zeus tatted on my arm, so it’s only right that I love souvlaki
I ate sushi, my life’s plush
That was just a dream back when I was on a bus
Now when I feel rough, I could just jump in a jet
And fly anywhere in the world whenever I’ve had enough
Like cos cool you know me
But done; leave me alone
At least have something constrructive to say
Next time you make me pick up the phone
I must be sitting on a gold mine
You are onto me more than my own wife
So fuck you if you’ve known me since ‘09
There’s motherfuckers that’ve known me my whole life
Those motherfuckers that’ve known me my whole life

Need more than 20 bottles for the whole night
I’m back and I’m flying a flight through the city
And I will carry on doing that my whole life
If you add up what’s on my neck that’s more than what’s in your bank
You wanna back out a strap well it better not be a blank
So good luck to these thirsty bruddas
Tryna get a drink off me that I already drank

[Outro:]
I drank that shit
I drank that shit
Cos I'm the motherfucking king of the jungle
I drank that shit
And I ain't forgot about them other guys
This is just 2.5
Wait til you hear 3Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh Na Na Na Na Na (x2)

Hear me out…

This is my king’s speech, I’m nowhere near the end
If I s-stutter… Sorry I ain’t heaven’s sent
I messed my life up, yeah I’ve been down
I’m a changed man now… Chris Brown
Ya know I feel your pain ‘cos I done been through it

I’m Kurt Cobain but I just couldn’t do it
No point in turning back, just to hit rewind
Back To The Future.. Ma.. Marty McFly
Be the deciders with fire’cos I’m no longer looking in a reflection that I admire
I paint a picture of a fire… But there’s no one looking back at me since I’m a liar

If I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith…

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh Na Na Na Na Na
Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh

This is my last chance, I’m on my final straw
I came so close to b-breaking like a spinal chord
I came from nothing… Some kid in Camden
Now I’m flying with the birds.. Richard Branson
I’m a prince.. Yes I will.. Get the crown
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister’s round
So please forgive me.. If I make mistakes
But I’ll blow the bloody doors off… Michael Caine

If I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith…

Ohhhhhh

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

I’m free to be whatever I…
‘Cos I’m famous.. Call me Gallagher.. ‘Cos I’m so shameless
The papers sold a page at the cost of my failures
Victimised by the public… don’t know if I can take this
So I sing “So when you feel like there’s no more nothing left but the life you’ve broken.”
No regrets.. No turning back.. Pick up yourself and tell them I’m just being me…

Ohhhhhh

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
No Regrets…

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No…No. Nobody crying over yesterday[Verse 1]
So I hate when I talk to my boy from pen and he acts like cuz you forgotten me
I ain’t got time to shit let alone come check you blud
You know I’m hot property
I got property
Right now I’m in Europe fucking up shit
More than the economy
So when you land you know I got you properly

[Hook]
I bring my people through with, everything I
Do
You reckon me I pop wid’ you
Ahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
You a snitchin’ little bitch and you love
Singin’ to the blues
Well this song wasn’t made for you
Ahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa
I’m coming
I’m coming
For you
Aaaahhaa
I’m coming
I’m coming
For you

[Verse 2]
Yo, fuck so good make a bitch wanna fight me
Wanna rolex ring Wiley
When I was a bum, no-one really liked me
Now its time someone went a got a new job for Tinie
I’m only playing
I’m just saying I’ll shit so hard I’m constipated
Overworked, underrated
Now my tings poppin’ off, no gun relation
Grind all day but I ain’t roller blading
All eyes on MOI, holla baby
No love for the X, on that note, T
Tell Kelly i’ve got that motivation
I beg, someone find Max online and let her know I wanna smash her from the back
If not Sarah Jane can come give me brain and put them big red lips on my sack!
I’ll be killin’ cause I’ll be getting bred
Hard doe, number 1′s all day on the chart show
So F*CK YOU and your 90 track mixtape
Thats a million bars of arsehole
My flows are wrecked and it opens legs
Its fly than a motherfucking jumbo jet
What a selfish bastard, no respect
You know Dapz, no regrets
I still roll through my hood and I wear my chain
F*ck a top boy Scorcher and Bashy can’t do the same
Real recognised, reaaaalll
How many albums have you sold today?
I ain’t saying that I'm Wayne or Kanye
But I’m living life on the runway
If your nang, I’ll be like ‘Welcome on board my brudda, say bye to gun play’
King of the jungle, hardest can be, I dare you to let your chick party with me
Im Tarzan and im hung like a tree
Imagine if your new born pops out looking exactly like moi
Banter, but on the real get her on pampers because I’ll be on the tour bus getting pampered
I heard Simon Cowell thinks I’m a little wanker
An i’m getting on his tits like Cancer
And I don’t wanna start mentioning names (Fuck it)
Where they all now? There bankrupt!
Joe McElderry, oh what a stand up!
Alexandra, pull your socks up!
Where you hits at? You ain’t no winner!
I feel bad cause your voice is amazing but your careers getting raped by a Mason
That shit fucking upsets me, cause it don’t get me, try bring them near me
Coming round with your hands out, wanting a hand out, ahhhh thats too political
I don’t care about a Bentley, Gucci or a Fendi, man's living in a spaceship!
You got clapped by a, BANG!
Your girl got macked by a BANG!
That smooth criminal
I’m a product of my environment I ain’t sayin’ me and you are any different
I’m just planning an early retirement
I don’t mean surrey when I say I’m going Kingston
Every mans welcome to fly long distance
We be on the beach with Weed Man Winston! WINSTON!
Plus I’m the craziest ting out the United Kingdom

[Hook][Intro: Dappy]
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh (na na naii)
Ah uh uh oh
Ah uh uh oh (Tinchy Stryder)
Ah uh uh oh (N-Dubz)
Ah uh uh oh (yo)

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
It was nothing but a quick thing kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
Now I'm hoping you never go missing
Now I'm telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens
Thought it would be done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called "Don’t Go"
Now it's just you and me on a love road
We done it like D-low, us two tiptoe, duck, dive, get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now we’re deep in, way past intros, Dappy, explain though

[Hook: Dappy]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, it was all now, never planned no after
It was like games, jokes, laughter
Live for the moment, left it all open
Now I’m in deep, flames, lava, breathe, calmer
And now I’m stating, see I never saw this in my daydream
It's really you that I’m fully rating
And the day's here, no more waiting
Played it all wise cause a smart man raised him
I was all hurt, pain, aching
On the wrong path then a good girl saved him
That’s why I'm letting her know she’s amazing

[Hook: Dappy]

[Bridge: Dappy]
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way

[Middle 8: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, I ain't never gonna let nothing get in the way
You played your cards all right, you're an ace
You make my nights all bright, you're my days
You took me out of the maze
You are number one

[Hook: Dappy]

[Outro: Tinchy Stryder]
Number one in the race, you’re a leader
Girl, you’re out of this world, they can't see ya
And now you got a place in my heart, it's funny how you actually went
From my homie to my only number one[Intro]
All or nothing
(Oh)
All or nothing

[Verse 1: Dappy]
Show me a hand, got a plan know a way where we can double up
Done it before, this ain't another case of beginners luck
Lost bad soul, I knew I had to have another go
Now I'm on fire, but I ain't gonna' stop, drop and roll roll
Roll the dice, 'til we ain't gonna' leave with nothin'
Today's another lucky day and I ain't even bluffin'
My winning streaks never felt so strong from wrong, (you can blame it all on me)
Lets go all in, go all in and throw the whole lot on the line
Steaks couldn't be higher and only a liar would say they're happy with second place
Lets go all in, go all in, lets spin the wheel and roll the dice
Baby, because we're on fire and if this ends in tears, then you can let them fall on me
Cause I want it all, nothing in this world's impossible
See, I've never had anything, so now I just want it all
And something deep inside makes me want more, see I will do anything just to have everything (oh)

[Hook: Dappy]
All or nothing
See, I've never had anything now I just want it all
All or nothing
See, I will do anything just to have everything
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Dappy]
Oh, I think there's something in me, because me and lady luck got so much history
Alakazam, I'mma turn pennies to fifties
And I'll make shit spin like I'm flying a frisbee
If you're with me you should let me know, cause you'll be sorry if you let me go
If you don't try, you'll never know
My winning streaks never felt so strong from wrong, and you can blame it all on me
So legs go all in, go all in, lets throw the whole lot on the line
The steaks couldn't be higher and only a liar would say they're happy with second place
Lets go all in, go all in and spin the wheel and roll the dice
Baby, because we're on fire and if this ends in tears, then you can let them fall on me
Cause I want it all, (I want it all), nothing in this worlds impossible (impossible)
See, I've never had anything so now I just want it all
And something deep inside makes me want more, see I will do anything just to have everything (oh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dappy]
Look into my eyes, and you will see a sign
Cause too much just ain't enough
So we'll turn to gold, cause we are on a roll
I'm rebelling, rebelling, rebelling
I want it all, (I want it all)
Nothing in this worlds impossible (impossible)
See, I've never had anything so now I just want it all (I want it all)
And something deep inside makes me want more, see I will do anything just to have everything (oh)

[Hook][Verse 1]
You say you wanna love me, you say I'm just a fake
You say I'm just another one that never had your back
Do you feel my presence? Maybe I should go
Maybe I'm another that you need to let go
See one day if you let me I will try and mend this broken past
Yeah, my heart will save us cause I am never giving up on us

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you love me you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
Cause if you need me you should have never pushed me away

[Chorus]
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you'll never see
Cause I see
The beautiful me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya

[Verse 2]
They say that I'm a liar cause I'm from an estate
But what you say behind my back you know I'll say it your face
I wish we could let bygones be bygones and so on and fire on
For you I swear I'll catch another case

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I weren't brought up round money so I didn't know how to treat it
I helped everyone round me and spent it all just when I needed it
I made a mil' and splashed it, did it all again
This time round, can't even trust myself, let alone my friends
If I'm the man why they don't play me no more?
That can't be fair right?
Just don't get it cause I'm on their side
I wish they wore these Nikes, took a hike to see what it's like in my spare time
And then come back and tell me that I deserve to lose all my air time

[Chorus] (x2)[Intro]
Na, na, nye
Ooh, na, na, ooh, na, na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
N-Dubz, N-Dubz, N-Dubz

[Verse 1: Dappy]
It's like first things first
You probably think I'm a chap with good manners
Well, you're wrong, I'm the scum of the earth
I'm the worst of the worst
And I ain't boasting 'bout my verses
I'm speaking 'bout the way I run around snatching purses
For every meaning there's a purpose
Just because I never went to school, it don't mean that I can't be perfect
For screaming' out loud
We's addicted to money like two fingers tapping on wherever there's a vein
And believe me, yeah we proud
Cause life is getting sicker by the day
And therefore we'll always stick around
Tonight you'll see the size of me
You wouldn't think I'm any harm, innit?
Think again, I'll take your wallet nicely
Chat up your wife to be
Middle class Daddy's Girl
I think I need to get me one and your one looks just right for me
So come on, you want to fight with me
Might as well be polite to me
Unless you want to deal with fifteen roughed up, been through too much niggas that would ride for me
Sit you down and remove all your designer garments off you silently
So I suggest, go somewhere else and try to impress
Cause deep beneath the decks you ain't never getting respect
I mean last night I had a dream that I was rich as hell
But the sick thing is I was acting like a bitch as well
Isn't it funny how money can make a lot of people change?
You think you're my friend, blood, I'm telling you, you ain't

[Hook]
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money, that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

[Verse 2: Tulisa]
I remember once upon a time when I was just thirteen
So innocent and giving, everyone would act like they love me
Then all the bitching and rumors began, seemed like I didn't have any friends
So much hate, lies and deceit, caused by all that jealousy
Now do you bitches really think that I'm the same girl I used to be?
Do you really think I will back down from you hoes
If you try to bring it to me?
I know you're hating cause your man keeps watching
But I don't even want him, so tell him stop clocking
The more you hate I get closer to my goal
You'll wake up as nothing at twenty years old

[Hook]
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?

[Verse 3: Fazer]
Yeah, I remember them days when I didn't have no rhymes
Practicing my verse in the class 'til it was home time
I never used to pay attention in school
Was playing penny up the wall or in detention with fools
That's why most the teachers used to doubt me
They used to say I wouldn't make in my music just to see me get rowdy
So I could switch in the classroom for an excuse to kick me out
I wonder why I'm bunking all my lessons in the bathroom
Now I'm starving hungry, working hard for this super stardom life
Been kinda hard for me to try and make it right
And it's hard to decide, whether I should leave behind
All my peeps in this life, to move forward and seek what I find
This life is lethal like a crackbaby being born addicted to the crack
So much evil in people
Dappy said it first, so I guess that I'm the sequel
So just because I'm black it don't mean that I can't be equal
For screaming out louder
We's addicted to mics like two nostrils fucked up wherever there's some coke
And believe me, yeah, we're prouder
[With Dappy]Cause life's been sick from day and therefore it's only going to get harder
I love my Nike Airs but now I'm moving onto Gucci and Prada
Used to looking rugged but a tux looks smarter
And no, you don't know me
And no, you ain't my codie
So there's nothing on these streets that you can ever try and show me

[Hook]
You better not waste my time
I got better things on my mind
I need to leave jerks like you behind
Cause all they ever do is just bring me down
So would you let me be or I'll make you disappear
When you hear the word money that's the only time you ever interfere
I thought that you was there, no, no
But I guess I'm wrong, why would you care?
[X3][Verse 1: Dappy & Margs]
Somebody Better ring 999 if they wanna get rid of me
Call the coastguard, bring the military
I never came to pose for no photo
I ain't a statue, don't take liberties
Exclusive imports from Italy
I got swagger that's sharp like a guillotine
I see a couple good girls that are feeling me
But only bad girls get into my billie jeans
They Be loving me because I give them what they ask for
Follow me, they let me out the hard door
I hear gossip cause I'm in the heat
Anything that I'm packin needs it's own passport
Passport? I thought he was a spaceman, am only playing fam
I'm looking at short skirts, Raybans

[Bridge]
Hows you night gone, you got a light hun
Is that your man he's a right blag
Somebodys coming home with me tonight
High heels, Fake tans

We go stumbling down the stairs I'm wavey
Hold me up
Hows your night cuz, you got a light blud
So is that your girl, she mite still
Somebody is coming home with me tonight

[Hook]
I mite do something I regret tonight, I don't care
Cause when I wake up...
I - I - I I won't remember
I won't remember a thing
If only you could stay like this for ever
Then I'll be living the dream, dream dream
(Your comin with me)
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

[Verse 2: Dappy & Margs]
It feels like the night couldn't get any better
Feel like any girl I want, I can get her
I'm getting hot, I might take of my top
But I'll still make it rain
Better get an umbrella
What ella ella forget about your fella
Got a table full of great goose and don't please
Put your purse back in ya bag, tonights on me
Never know tomorrow you could be on page 3
Fall to the floor, feeling bad like a jagerbomb
No jetski can ride this wave I'm on
Who knows, if I wave my wand
I might turn your girl into a baby mum

So don't you wish your boyfriend had a uh like me
I'm looking at short skirts, raybans
High heels, Fake tans
We go stumbling down the stairs am wavey
Hold me up

[Bridge]
Hows ya night gone, you got a light hun
Is that man he's a right blank
Somebodies comin home with me tonight

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Cover Drive]
It's not a science, now
It's just a way it goes
You spin me all around
No gravity, no ground
My world is your snow globe
You turn me upside down
You know I like the shake
You make my heart quake

[Bridge: Cover Drive]
You speak and I'm grumbling
You move and I'm fluttering
Slowly I'm losing control

[Hook: Cover Drive]
I feel it banging
Got me vibrating
You got me and I'm falling, so don't let me go
No one could save me
No drug could fix me
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode

[Verse 2: Cover Drive]
You're looking in my face and I can't keep it down
I let the words escape I've gone and shout it out
No I can't help myself, I can't control it babe, I feel it building up
You got me blown away

[Bridge: Cover Drive]
You speak and I'm grumbling
You move and I'm fluttering
Slowly I'm losing control

[Hook: Cover Drive]
I feel it banging
Got me vibrating
You got me and I'm falling, so don't let me go
No one could save me
No drug could fix me
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode

[Verse 3: Dappy]
I'm the daddy and you know that
You know once you go Dap you never go back
Should be on my shhh
Even though she got a man at home
Three words whipped Indiana Jones
I'mma take a back seat
But only if you get in front
Body smoking she loves it when I'm being blunt
Sun kissed skin straight from the Caribbean
You a good girl pretty bad news
See that you ain't in for the moolah
Don't think cause you're hot I won't throw you in the cooler
You know you're my bad b, so hold that
I wanna look into your eyes till they roll back
Put it, put it down on me baby do it nice and slow
If you ain't like them others show me something that I don't know
If you're a time bomb then I'm gonna make you blow
Just leave them high heels on and turn them lights down low

[Hook: Cover Drive]
I feel it banging
Got me vibrating
You got me and I'm falling, so don't let me go
No one can save me
No drug can fix me
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode[Hook]
So now all you wanna know
But where was you when I was broke
Now I see love you've never shown
So what you think I'm dating, I swear we made it
Ah so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
Who's been claiming that they're ill - fuck them I'm a disease
I put my money where my mouth is, they be lying through their teeth
Oh don't be mistaken, I still hit down a pagon
Ah so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
I done raise the bar so high no satellite can find me
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out their sleep
Pissed- pissed that they faded
Burn them they've been cremated, ah

Lies, you've been gassing up them hoes with your bullshit
Coz you've been pissing on your balls with your small dick, (look I got my willy out) hey!
And the camera's on
But nothin' can't be wrong with that, if that's what harry's on
Tarzan's in the booth big, char drying my hand
I ain't showing of my tan, I'm just
Letting my shit, hang on
I'm like half the size of Ricky bitch,
I sound nothin' like Drizzy
It's time I beat up the game like, Chris Breezy did to RiRi
That's just D-A taking the P-P-Y, I'm doing Migi
Them ringtone rappers ain't got no credit
Run rings around and breaks one leg in
Piece o' cake,soft and sweet
I'll piss on them and their royal toilet seats
I shit on them oily freaks, they'll never catch me on a sunbed
Coz' no-one cares about, what the fuck was made in Chelsea
The only way is the streets, don't care what no-one tells me
Started of, ones then, two shots, none left, ten man, one pen, then times that
Aaah, BLOAW, aaah
Pussy roll on my carpet, coz' the king of the jungle just took the piss out the muppet
Took a shit turn into rookie, then wiped his ass with an artist
Didn't even get time to flush it coz' the fucking thing charted (haha)
It's over you're finished shut up, you dickheads be quiet
I'm stuffing my face and I'm taking pussy, you on a diet
You the type to go to Gucci
Pick up a hat just to try it, take a picture
Post it on twitter then don't even buy it
You cat, you don't hustle, you just listen to nip CD the only strap
You ever is what's on the top of your kick's G? I got strap
Once before and you can even ask Tinchy
I got them out my shit, BRAP
And it wasn't officially, you see my chain's linked to my pride
If you take that it comes with my life
We'll take it outside not even my toilet will let shit slide
Let alone that booky man and that whip
Don't think they're playing around with their dick
If only you see the shape of that clip
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, suck your mum you prick

[Hook]
So now you wanna know
But where was you when I was broke
Now I see love you've never shown
So what you think I'm dating, I swear we made it
Ah so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
Who's been claiming that they're ill - fuck them I'm a disease
I put my money where my mouth is, they be lying through their teeth
Oh don't be mistaken, I stall it down a pagan
Ah so fuck them, they don't go as hard as me
I don't raise the bar so high no satellite can't find me
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out their sleep
Pissed- pissed that they faded
Burn them they've been cremated, ah

[Outro]
I'm the king of the jungle no-ones fucking with tarzan, so
Fuck them[Verse 1]
I’ve seen a lot of things in life that words can't explain
See we ain’t any different but we just ain’t the same
They never listen when we tell ‘em, tell ‘em
All they understand is venom, venom
People only use you when you let ‘em, let ‘em
Well if that's the case then I’m the one to blame

[Hook]
Cause there’s a man over board
And the tides gonna drag him down
If there’s a man in the clouds
Then tell me where the hell is he now
Why is the silence so loud
Have I thrown it all away
Let me know, Let me know
Tell me is that what happens just for having a good
Intention, -tension oh-hoh
Look what happened to my Good Intention, -tension oh-hoh
Why won’t anybody answer my question
Why is the silence so loud
I think I threw it all away
I don't know, I don't know
But let me know
Hear me out before you label me the bad one

[Verse 2]
I’m walking through the desert but I’m drowning inside
No river runs deeper than the tear from my eye
You only wen't and made me bitter, bitter
I wish I wasn’t such a giver, giver
Apologise to my liver, liver
Cause if that's the case then you're the one to blame

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Am I wrong to think the worlds got it in for me
And am I right to say I'm longing for some sympathy
See I feel a sound, but I can’t hear it
Thats my heart strings getting played like a symphony
Yo, you know you turned me insane
Why you staring at window
When I’m the one with the pain
You know you set me off the rails
And you’ll be to blame
If you’re ever hear
I jumped in front of the train with both fucked in the
Braaaaaaaaaaain
(woah-hoh)

[Hook]And they don’t know a thing about me
They don’t know a thing about me
They don’t know a thing about me
‘cause they don’t know a, they don’t know a
They don’t know a thing about me
Don’t believe a word you hear about me
They don’t know a, they don’t know a…

It was the only release, they’re always in touch with Georgia
But they don’t know a thing about me
They smile when they say at the end of the day
What do you expect? They’re only assuming
Can’t exactly stop them from assuming
It’s time they learn a thing about me
So here’s the truth, this album’s full of fire, fire

All that I can be, is brutally honest
And I don’t wanna say no more
I’m switch it in, five, four, three, two, one, off
I still can say some shit and tie it on my skin
Boy, when there’s so much to address, tell me where the fuck to begin
I think I’ll start with my community
When I see Cameron I should grab him by his neck and raise him up like a uni fee
How could these greedy bastards put our taxes in their pockets?
Fucking an MP, to me that just stands for maximum profit
It ain’t my fault, I’m from a jungle where them animals love to smoke ‘nough
Hid the can, chase the dragon and die of slow death
Raise middle fingers to the system trying to hide the fact
That we’re poorly driven, I should pay Boris on his own test
Take him to the truck, stick him in a hot chair
At a blunt, chase and cook, now, that’s a dope jail
That’s why we hate corps, but we loving the fame
I’m glad I smashed the paparazzi’s camera off the filthy gate
That’s roughed up shit, they all know I’m living a life
But the money couldn’t change me, that’s why I’m still on the hype
I’m just a man with a Visa, used to know Tulisa
I don’t know about facing my other dime on the vida
I don’t do my laundry in public, I tell the bus where to stop it
I can pull my own strings, go suck a dick up in my paddy
The only time you ain’t no hooty is when you’re wearing a jump-air
Hear my guess around the dinner, around me since we’ve been young
You’re the only one to pull me when I never had none
Always around me to follow when I’m the follow number
I’m at all to sacrifice getting richer, just to help a brother
But if I could I’d kidnap all undercover
I still smoke cheese, getting beef, try me, I’m a bug
I fuck the rap had sent to me, I’ll get the fun up

And they don’t know a thing about me
They don’t know a thing about me
They don’t know a thing about me
‘cause they don’t know a, they don’t know a
They don’t know a thing about me
None of the words you hear about me
They don’t know a, they don’t know a…

You was my only release, my always the first to judge
But they don’t know a thing about me
That’s why what they say at the end of the day
Won’t you expect? We’re only human
Caught in sight, it’s only for assuming
It’s time they learn a thing about me
So here’s the truth, this album’s full of fire, fire

Now, that’s just my introOh I owe you,
But how come it's took me this long to say it,
Cause I been hiding the truth,
Didn't think I'd let you in on this shit,
But you know I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,
You see I've tried this on my own
Ohh I-I owe you,
Imagine if i never got got see you again

I'm gonna bite my tongue next time that you're speakin',
Cause you deserve the time of day,

I abuse your kindness with my weakness
And threw it in your face
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke
If only you could see how I feel
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming
See I ain't angry with you, there's no escaping what I've done

I-I hope you, hear these words
Lord strike me down if any, one of them's untrue
You are the reason I am what I've become
I-I owe you even though you don't want nothing
I owe you one

Hand on heart I don't think there's any other way to say this
But I admit being a prick didn't do me any favours
I mean I've been called every name under the
Sun's in my eyes, but it feels pitch black inside
I swear I put you so through much now I couldn't lie to you if I tried
I admit acting a fool didn't do me any favours
Imagine if I never got to see you again

I bite my tongue next time that you're speakin'
Cause you deserve the time of day
I abuse your kindness with my weakness
And threw it in your face
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke
If only you could see how I feel
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming
See I ain't angry with you, there's no escaping what I've done

I-I hope you, hear these words
Lord strike me down if any, one of them's untrue
You are the reason I am what I've become
I-I owe you even though you don't want nothing
I owe you one

Ohh, oh oh ohh ohhhhh
Just be with me, let me, speak to me
I’m so sorry if I’ve drained you out
That’s why I love you
And I hope you’re glad you made me finally see
That I’m nothing without you
Just tell me, I'mma see you again

I swear I'll bite my tongue next time that you're speakin'
Cause you deserve the time of day
I abuse your kindness with my weakness
And threw it in your face
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke
If only you could see how I feel
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming
See I ain't angry with you, there's no escaping what I've done

I-I hope you, hear these words
Lord strike me down if any, one of them's untrue
Cause you are the reason I am what I've become
I-I owe you even though you owe me nothing
I owe one

I-I owe you, but you owe me nothing
Cause I owe you one[Intro: Dappy (Tulisa)

This is my king’s speech, I’m nowhere near the end
If I s-stutter… Sorry I ain’t heaven’s sent
I messed my life up, yeah I’ve been down
I’m a changed man now… Chris Brown
Ya know I feel your pain ‘cos I done been through it

I’m Kurt Cobain but I just couldn’t do it
No point in turning back, just to hit rewind
Back To The Future.. Ma.. Marty McFly
Be the deciders with fire’cos I’m no longer looking in a reflection that I admire
I paint a picture of a fire… But there’s no one looking back at me since I’m a liar

If I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith…

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh Na Na Na Na Na
Oo-oh-oo-oh-oo-ohhh

This is my last chance, I’m on my final straw
I came so close to b-breaking like a spinal chord
I came from nothing… Some kid in Camden
Now I’m flying with the birds.. Richard Branson
I’m a prince.. Yes I will.. Get the crown
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister’s round
So please forgive me.. If I make mistakes
But I’ll blow the bloody doors off… Michael Caine

If I should die before I wake.. The least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith…

Ohhhhhh

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

I’m free to be whatever I…
‘Cos I’m famous.. Call me Gallagher.. ‘Cos I’m so shameless
The papers sold a page at the cost of my failures
Victimised by the public… don’t know if I can take this
So I sing “So when you feel like there’s no more nothing left but the life you’ve broken.”
No regrets.. No turning back.. Pick up yourself and tell them I’m just being me…

Ohhhhhh

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)
No point in crying over yesterday

No Regrets (x2)
No Regrets…

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner… but looking back at me is someone else

No Regrets (x2)

No Regrets (x2)
‘Cos we ain’t even seen the best of days

‘Cos when I look in a mirror…I don’t even recognize myself

[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
It was nothing but a quick thing kids games, kiss chase, just a quick fling
Now I'm hoping you never go missing
Now I'm telling you, you can hold this ring, watch how it glistens
Thought it would be done as quick as the wind blows
Didn't think I would ever be involved
So I even wrote a song called "Don’t Go"
Now it's just you and me on a love road
We done it like D-low, us two tiptoe, duck, dive, get low
And now I care less about who knows
Now we’re deep in, way past intros, Dappy, explain though

[Hook: Dappy]
See never did I think a boy like me would be in need
When all I really wanted was to have some fun
Now I'm losing my head, I'm telling you one thing
You’re number one
See, I don’t understand how you’re number one
When it was just a fling before, now, you’re the one
See, all I did was blink twice
From my homie to my only number one

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, it was all now, never planned no after
It was like games, jokes, laughter
Live for the moment, left it all open
Now I’m in deep, flames, lava, breathe, calmer
And now I’m stating, see I never saw this in my daydream
It's really you that I’m fully rating
And the day's here, no more waiting
Played it all wise cause a smart man raised him
I was all hurt, pain, aching
On the wrong path then a good girl saved him
That’s why I'm letting her know she’s amazing

[Hook: Dappy]

[Bridge: Dappy]
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way
You lift me off the ground
I always want you around
I ain't gonna let nothing get in the way
Won't never let nothing get in the way

[Middle 8: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo, I ain't never gonna let nothing get in the way
You played your cards all right, you're an ace
You make my nights all bright, you're my days
You took me out of the maze
You are number one

[Hook: Dappy]

[Outro: Tinchy Stryder]
Number one in the race, you’re a leader
Girl, you’re out of this world, they can't see ya
And now you got a place in my heart, it's funny how you actually went
From my homie to my only number one[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Girl you should come to my house
Big face Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big face Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it

[Verse 1: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Look at you, look at me stocking these clothes
I ain't even turned up yet, I ain't gone home
If I do I'm putting on a suit and turning up in a Cayman, driving around
Oh na na, they salute when they see, I came in surfing around
I can get the honeys in the road
Look at you, look at me still in these clothes
I ain't even been to sleep yet
I've been doing late night shifts, 10 hours in a show, they all grinding it out
Oh they won't understand, when I'm in the booth and I'm high in the cloud

[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Girl you should come to my house
Big faced Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I've been getting money like a dope dealer, on the low grinding all week
Bought some new clothes upon a Tuesday, wore the same fit all week-end
Hand one bitch, she brought three friends
I ain't gotta fake or gotta pretend
Great White when it comes to R&B hits
We couldn't park there, probably get a precinct
I've been counting on the Washington's
Lincoln's and the Jackson's, Franklin's  and the Benjamin's
I done hear some ladies talk a little, little vanilla in em
Mix it with some cinnamon, abum don't drop, I'ma still eat
Living through the hundreds, call it blue cheese

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
I've been getting Grammys on the low
You be in the club singing all my shit
You ain't even know I wrote all em other niggas songs
I cannot blame you, who does their homework
They don't check credits any more
I don't be trippin', I just head to the bank and the bars in the morn'
I would be foolish to take al this money, take pictures and post on the ground, nigga
I really do this, I don't have to prove it to you, niggas know who I am
So you can trick on them hoes if you wanna
But your cheque gon' be gone in the morning
While I'm sitting on a private beach
Just me and my girl in the private suite, nigga

[Hook: Angel]
I've been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
I've been getting money on the low
Big faced Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
Casue I've been getting money on the low

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
I've been getting money on the low
Phone on silent, ringing hitters outside
Since I've been doing well, said I left her in a drought
Don't let me R. Kelly in your house, I can really take the piss with it
See I'm the one in front of six digits
Froggy style, make her quick ribbit
Said she like a cool nigga with a big business
I got an ice bucket challenge on my wrist, innit
Gorgeous like my other chick Zara
She got the vibes but she's never been to Gaza
And she look better on a bottle than a sparkler
And now like funny tummy, yeah I got the last laugh
Girl [?], I pulled up in a Phantom, listening to Buju Banton
I can boom bye bang em if I want
The woman and my clothes don't be clashing
Cause they're both so Italian
I run diesel by the gallon when I [?]

[Verse 5: Dappy]
I keep it 100 even when i'm down to zero
So tell your don scarface he's no Al Pacino
This ain't a movie so watch who you're watching
And that shit you're rocking
Cause I might have to rob it like De Niro
We never cut corners cause we lean on em like Ducati's
You be stuck in traffic busting swishers on the cabbies
Me I got all these foreign bitches screaming "Are you Dappy?"
Cause I be making money from London to Abu Dhabi
So what a blow, this is that straight off the bub flow
Call it cargo, fuck you and that half fro
I'm still to introduce you to the real Pablo
Said she don't love ya, I bet she'll love how fast your car goes
Let's get it right, in life you have to handle shit proper
Everything you see is all me, I would never borrow
They ain't letting me spray what I really wanna say
Cause at any stage they could drop me like Madonna
Then I'd really have to make money on the low

[Hook: Angel]
Money on the low, girl you should come to my house
Big face Rollie for the wrist, I left it home on the couch
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it
I'm the type of nigga that will hold it down
Been getting money on the low
Big face Rollie on your list, girl that's the price of a house
Even though a nigga don't show it
Everything you see, you know I own it
I've never been the type to go and blow it(dappy)
I don't slip or trip when she ask me where I've been
(where you been)
One big smile on my face d-darling it's just you and me
(you and me)
Now I'm on some Alfie behaviour I'll call you back later
To many fish in the sea for me
But when the lights come on and what's her name is gone
I realise where I'm supposed to be

[Hook:] (tulisa)
I tried to believe every word of your sweet story
But intuition keeps telling me
Your making a fool outtameeee

[Hook:](dappy & tulisa)
Cause I'm such a good liar
Just admit it
I never did it
Yes you did

No I didn't (yes you did)
Cause I'm such a good liar
Wwwoooooeeee
I can't help myself I keep playing with fire
Wwwoooooeeee
Ha hahaha

(tulisa)
Thoughts running wild through the night as I watch
You sleep (she's getting closer)
I can't help but check his text while he's passed out
Next to me (it's only a matter of time)
I'm on some CSI behaviour
Who's gonna save ya
You'll be the fool when the truth comes outttttt
But when those lights come on and what's her face
Is gone we're straight back to the same routine

[Hook:] (tulisa)
I tried to believe every word of your sweet story
But intuition keeps telling me

[Hook:] (dappy)

(fazer)
Can't keep up with these lies
She do anything to try and catch me out
But I never leave no signs
In my heart we were meant to be
Guys like me we be like 2 or 3 trust
I can't help myself I love girls (what)
I get a kick out of play with fire
I get a kick out of play with fire
Playing with fire
Playing with fire
She Ain't going no where you know why?

[Hook:]

Ha hahaha
Ha hahaha
Ha hahahaThey say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
Well ima cut to the chase

I used to wish on a star but nowadays I need space: Satellites
See the black shades white chain, flashing lights
Never thought I could of felt this low in the highlights
So I asked Phyllis its still another day in paradise
Is the heaven for the forever 27
Could it be three years till I'm jammin' with legends?
I got thousands of fans, but I don't get the obsession
There's a nice guy inside, I guess I've never met him

Cause I could buy a fast car But not even an aeroplane can seem to get me out of here
The pressure and the stress are both dying to see the end of me
And the man in the mirror is looking at me like an enemy

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Whoa
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, causee

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
So ima cut to the chase

Cause I'm living like a Rockstar
I ain't afraid the good die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG

Mama always told me there's someone looking over me
Think she meant the guy with the camera tryna photo me
Be careful what you wish for, cause the truths a little different
If the Guardian's my angel, why's the Sun burning holes in me?
They let me loose on the public, but I didn't prepare
I get shock by a lens everytime I appear
Put a star in the room, I swear it changes the atmosphere
Cause I'm a celebrity, can someone get me out of here

Whoa
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger every time
Whoa
Don't let em tell you how to live your life, causee

Cause I'm living like a Rockstar
I ain't afraid the good die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away, away, away

Cause I don't care, I don't care
Take me there, take me thaere
Na nan a I ain't scared, I ain't scared
Take me there
But I'mma cut to the chase

You ain't a legend till your set in stone
But now your just flesh and bone
Just a little proud child bored at home
I'll be the best till my dying breath: Brian Jones
A wise girl once sang tears dry on their own
Fuck a moment of silence in my house
We shut the whole shit down for Winehouse
You , so I've got something to say
Take aim, pull the trigger
Cause your never going to blow me away

They say that I'm dangerous
Like everything I touch it falls apart
If I were to tell, they'll kill me now
So imam cut to the chase

Cause I'm living like a Rockstar
I ain't afraid to die young
Cause I be living like a rockstar
I blow up a million miles away

Cause I don't care, I don't care
Take me there, take me thaere
Na nan a I ain't scared, I ain't scared
Take me there
But I'mma cut to the chase

(Guitar solo)

Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Chicka BANG BANG[Verse 1: Tinchy Stryder]
Yo I got one or two on my list let me tick em off
Rochelle from The Saturdays, Pixie Lott
Who would of thought I'd got this far
And how on Earth did his name brand get that large?
Cause I'm a fucking star
Have you seen my car
Holly Willoughby you can come around my bar
I want it all no minimal
Tinchy the general
Me and my brother DAP's that's clinical
Oh, I was raised a survivor
Now im getting *** as a fiver
Rider account now I living
The fist chance I was given lifer

[Bridge: Dappy]
You've always been my undercover lover
Nothing like no other
Tell me to get em all cause em all my lover
My mama and my papa
From pounds to the dollar
Negative to positive no longer will I suffer

[Hook: Dappy]
My momma thought I wouldn't make it
But now shes living in a spaceship
She said son I'm getting older
Told her money buys everything
Would you like a face lift>
See I didn't know I would be able to afford
All these clothes
Look at where we are
That's what happens when you make it

[Verse 2: Tinchy Stryder]
Yeah I'm the shit round here
I use to chill up on the block
Where they pushed on stairs
I was always tryna get a little kiss off her
Now shes screamin beggin me crimp my hair
Ever since I made it, vision never faded
Vex to my right hand man dirt david
He was like Tinch, maintain it
Better keep shit running never get constipated
Money ain't a thing, forever doubling
But with out the fans I wouldn't have anything
Screaming Strydes forever lovin' him
And I ain't ever bought a ring

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Me, I play the keyhole following the plans
Fresh from the motherland
See I do it for the seating, I do it for the stands
Now let me see your hands
Let me introduce you to the band
And I'm the main man
Building up my following, hold it with fans
Believe than I can
Now I'm looking for my number 1 fan, let's stand
If only I could only tell you how much you changed my life
See I do it for the seats, and I do it for the stands
Now let me see your hands
I couldn't have done this without you all here tonight
See I do it for the seats, and I do it for the stands
Now let me see your hands

[Hook][Jordan Morris]
I wanna win, I wanna fight
See the hunger in my eyes
The role of a man, I’m here to provide
Putting you first and imma tell you why
I’m tired of fighting
We’re losing all sight of what made you and I
My taking my pride and I’ll put it aside
If it makes you alright
I said no, no, no, no, No more fighting
Girl I’ve done deciding, I’m taking your side
No, no, no, no, No more hiding I’m breaking the silence
By taking your side
I know we’ve had our differences
It’s time for something different
I’m down by your side, Drop the pride
No more fighting, Coz I’m done deciding
I’m taking your side
Were in the same room
But you feel alone
Without your love this house is not a home
Broken and beaten, but were not defeaten
We know where we both belong
I’m tired of fighting
We’re losing all sight of what made you and I
I’m taking my pride and I’ll put it aside
If it makes you alright
I said no, no, no, no, No more fighting
Girl I’ve done deciding, I’m taking your side
No, no, no, no, No more hiding I’m breaking the silence
By taking your side
I know we’ve had our differences
It’s time for something different
I’m down by your side, Drop the pride
No more fighting, Coz I’m done deciding
I’m taking your side

[Dappy]
But I come with a point of view
That’s why I’m putting down the finger that I point at you
If I’m vulnerable, your miss know it all
Let’s see how long it lasts before you blow it all
Coz you love to ride the dick
Exactly how you ride my whip
Coz that shits classy
What’s mine is yours, so go ahead and smash it
Here’s the keys go ahead and crash it
Coz I’ve always had respect for you
But in the beds the only time I connect with you
Can’t lie you’ve got bars, and there always gassed
That’s why me and you will always clash
What are we meant to do?
So is this what it takes, for heaven sakes
Keep your hands on the wheel and get them out of my face
Swear down you better hit the brakes right now
I said...

[Jordan Morris]
No, no, no, no, No more fighting
Girl I’ve done deciding, I’m taking your side
No, no, no, no, No more hiding I’m breaking the silence
By taking your side
I know we’ve had our differences
It’s time for something different
I’m down by your side, Drop the pride
No more fighting, Coz I’m done deciding
I’m taking your side…Ay, it's about time that I went in Hard
Fuck the singing for 16 bars
I'm going in, but I ain't go to my yard
This is written in the hood nowhere near the stars
I'm sorry if I ever robbed you in the past
From the bottom of the block
To the top of the charts
I use to save coins
Now I'm Swippin cards and
I'm in a spaceship, bun driving a car...
Fucked White, Brown and Black
I've felt knifes bats and straps
I got the runs when I swallowed them rats
Luckily I got famous and come out the trap
Now I'm bringin 4 Mobo's back to my Flat
Same place the feds try spin for crack
If they ever come back they ain't gonna find jack
All they gonna see my face on a plaque
See me I only roll with a Bitch that bags
Sayin she ain't with me juz coz I cracked
I'm always on a hype , she knows what I'm like
With a bottle she was up a soon as I smashed
If you violate you fuck with my ego
Never put your hands on my lil lord Gino
Coz I will get reckless like my brudda D-Bo
Then go and tell the judge fuck you like Cee Loo
We all wish we had cribs and porches
And it ain't just coke that gets imported
Shout to my brudda who just got deported
And to his mother who didn't know where the court is
Im spontaneous I don't care fam
I said no to the Def Jam chairman
You can't blame me they can't change me
Matter of fact fuck the sky I got bare FANS
So fallow the leader coz yes I did it
I shut down titter for 15 minutes
Most men who got famous turn pussy
But me I still jam in the ends and bill it
You haters your gyal will get banged like Cillit
It don't matter how tough your skin is
I got a little young star that will leave you all pissed
On the floor you won't know who did this
And yes I am that boy of the telly and this
Shit right here on my neck is a belly
Hit double plats before I turned 20
Im a burn like the guy who sticks in perry
So fuck going shopping coz I get free clothes
My minimum is 20 bags from a show
If you loved pass out then check the front row
I hear a lot of gun talk and it ain't no joke
Only mixtape I believe is K-Kokes
Animal on the mic but I ain't no host
I eat rappers alive human beans on toast
Turned 20 so I bought me a cartyad
Estate agent told me I can't be late
When I turned up told her chat to my briefcase
And take your shoes off my carpet mayn
Back in the school we got judged by the teacher
Whos on the panel now ..
Tulisa act like a superstar All you want real bad boy's
Sell out the O2 arena
25K if you want me on the feature
I love singin but ya know I ain't diva
Say sattin fucked on your track like nana

(Rapper Dappy has been at it again, getting himself into trouble)
(Rushed and evasive, N-Dubz lead singer Dappy fights his way into Guildford Crown Court)
(He's written a rap and made a video, he's called it Tarzan 2)
(As the rapper hugs tearful fans after avoiding prison)
(He added Dappy had learnt a very important lesson indeed)
(It's easy, you can talk about my fame as facts that you know about me
I'm in the public eye)
(I hate it but I'm a good person
I got a good heart, I got morals)
(Paparazzi, I'm filming you guys for once
Say something for my camera man)
(Interlude)
Shout out to Diego and my brother M.A.Z.E Revenge

[Verse:]
Yup! Versace Versace, I’ll lick down a hater cause I ain’t Gianni
If my kids want a bike well it’s only right I bring back a Ferrari
I bet, you didn’t know that the 20 gold chains ‘round my neck
I could swap 'em for property (I swapped that shit)
Cause when you skip jail and splash money in Mayfair, that’s real life Monopoly
If you think your baby mama’s a bitch, think again mine’s a monstrosity
Well she’s only pissed I treat all of my bitches equally, call it democracy
All of these hoes think because they cook and clean for me they can just climb up on top of me
Bitch my dick is a ticket so because of that I’d rather you swallow the lottery
We used to rock Nikes and hoodies and scarves round our face
To keep low in the manor
But now its Versace Versace, Armani, Cavalli, Dolce and Gabbana
See I am in touch with a feminine side
And your mum is a piff, yeah I bet I could bang her
So Versace Versace, these fools want a piece of me but I ain’t Montana
You can hustle all you want but my bars hold weight
Put 'em on your scales, that shit will break
That reptile around your waist is a snake
Cos she keeps on tryna fuck me like she wants to catch a case; that’s rape
What's up when you’ll be spending all your money on silicon handbags and all type of pedicures
But she’s call me Papi with tats on her body the thing is
That’s my name instead of yours
My neighbour’s a pussy, he thinks that I’m cocky
I’m young with a house worth a million
He tells me to turn down the music
Instead I have a rave right in my living room
Catch me in Dubai or on the street in Ibiza
Four bad bitches hanging out my 2-seater
When you too busy in the ends sweating in a cab
All the depression is not around me
Its Versace Versace Versace
I walk in Versace and leave in Versace
Then I went and got Zeus tatted on my arm, so it’s only right that I love souvlaki
I ate sushi, my life’s plush
That was just a dream back when I was on a bus
Now when I feel rough, I could just jump in a jet
And fly anywhere in the world whenever I’ve had enough
Like cos cool you know me
But done; leave me alone
At least have something constrructive to say
Next time you make me pick up the phone
I must be sitting on a gold mine
You are onto me more than my own wife
So fuck you if you’ve known me since ‘09
There’s motherfuckers that’ve known me my whole life
Those motherfuckers that’ve known me my whole life

Need more than 20 bottles for the whole night
I’m back and I’m flying a flight through the city
And I will carry on doing that my whole life
If you add up what’s on my neck that’s more than what’s in your bank
You wanna back out a strap well it better not be a blank
So good luck to these thirsty bruddas
Tryna get a drink off me that I already drank

[Outro:]
I drank that shit
I drank that shit
Cos I'm the motherfucking king of the jungle
I drank that shit
And I ain't forgot about them other guys
This is just 2.5
Wait til you hear 3[Verse 1]
So I hate when I talk to my boy from pen and he acts like cuz you forgotten me
I ain’t got time to shit let alone come check you blud
You know I’m hot property
I got property
Right now I’m in Europe fucking up shit
More than the economy
So when you land you know I got you properly

[Hook]
I bring my people through with, everything I
Do
You reckon me I pop wid’ you
Ahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
You a snitchin’ little bitch and you love
Singin’ to the blues
Well this song wasn’t made for you
Ahhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaa
I’m coming
I’m coming
For you
Aaaahhaa
I’m coming
I’m coming
For you

[Verse 2]
Yo, fuck so good make a bitch wanna fight me
Wanna rolex ring Wiley
When I was a bum, no-one really liked me
Now its time someone went a got a new job for Tinie
I’m only playing
I’m just saying I’ll shit so hard I’m constipated
Overworked, underrated
Now my tings poppin’ off, no gun relation
Grind all day but I ain’t roller blading
All eyes on MOI, holla baby
No love for the X, on that note, T
Tell Kelly i’ve got that motivation
I beg, someone find Max online and let her know I wanna smash her from the back
If not Sarah Jane can come give me brain and put them big red lips on my sack!
I’ll be killin’ cause I’ll be getting bred
Hard doe, number 1′s all day on the chart show
So F*CK YOU and your 90 track mixtape
Thats a million bars of arsehole
My flows are wrecked and it opens legs
Its fly than a motherfucking jumbo jet
What a selfish bastard, no respect
You know Dapz, no regrets
I still roll through my hood and I wear my chain
F*ck a top boy Scorcher and Bashy can’t do the same
Real recognised, reaaaalll
How many albums have you sold today?
I ain’t saying that I'm Wayne or Kanye
But I’m living life on the runway
If your nang, I’ll be like ‘Welcome on board my brudda, say bye to gun play’
King of the jungle, hardest can be, I dare you to let your chick party with me
Im Tarzan and im hung like a tree
Imagine if your new born pops out looking exactly like moi
Banter, but on the real get her on pampers because I’ll be on the tour bus getting pampered
I heard Simon Cowell thinks I’m a little wanker
An i’m getting on his tits like Cancer
And I don’t wanna start mentioning names (Fuck it)
Where they all now? There bankrupt!
Joe McElderry, oh what a stand up!
Alexandra, pull your socks up!
Where you hits at? You ain’t no winner!
I feel bad cause your voice is amazing but your careers getting raped by a Mason
That shit fucking upsets me, cause it don’t get me, try bring them near me
Coming round with your hands out, wanting a hand out, ahhhh thats too political
I don’t care about a Bentley, Gucci or a Fendi, man's living in a spaceship!
You got clapped by a, BANG!
Your girl got macked by a BANG!
That smooth criminal
I’m a product of my environment I ain’t sayin’ me and you are any different
I’m just planning an early retirement
I don’t mean surrey when I say I’m going Kingston
Every mans welcome to fly long distance
We be on the beach with Weed Man Winston! WINSTON!
Plus I’m the craziest ting out the United Kingdom

[Hook]
