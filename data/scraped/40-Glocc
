[Strophe I - Kool Savas:]
Putz deine Zähne bevor du mit mir redest
Du smellst aus dem Rachen wie'n Esel
Und dein Face is' hässlich wie'n Lancia Thesis
Du liegst auf dem Rücken wie'n Käfer, dein kleiner klebriger Penis
In der Hand und deine Schlampen-Schwester steht nur daneben
Mit 'nem Zewa, denkt sich: "Is' er Vater nicht ähnlich, der Penner?"
Ich komm zu euch nach Haus gekleidet wie'n Schädlingsbekämpfer
Und rotte dich aus, fick deine Frau
Piss in die Ecken und kack in die Wohnung
Guck, ich geb'n Fick auf die Spinner
Die denken sie rappen, egal wer, Jacke wie Hose
Ihr kriegt nix gebacken, ihr Homos, ich spitte die packenden Flows
Nich' meine Art und du spürst grad
Im Nacken die Hoden, wenn ich deinen Kopf fick
Optik! So außerirdisch, kosmisch
Deine Bitch is so nass, wenn man sie nur ein mal hackt
Wird der gesamte Nagel rostig
Ich hab ein Gehirn, dass wie'n Geschoss tickt und sein Ziel erreicht
Sag es mit mir: G-G-G-G-G OR 4 Life
Frag Borat! "I like" Noch einmal! "Highfive!"
S-A Fox zurück aus der Zukunft, back in der Steinzeit

[Refrain:]
Guckt euch an, ihr droppt Schmutz, als ob ihr im Klo wohnt
Unser Sound dagegen gibt die Zeit an wie 'n Chrono-
Graph, was wars? Du brauchst nur einen Co-Pro-
Duzenten, n bisschen Mojo und das nötige
Ch-Ch-Charisma (Oh!), Ch-Ch-Charisma (Oh!)
Ch-Ch-Charisma (Oh!), Ch-Ch-Charisma (Oh!)
Es is Zeit, dass ihr euren Flow mal erneuert
Wir droppen Bars aus Lava, heißer als Feuer, let's go!

[Strophe II - 40 Glocc:]
Money make the world go round, my life's a wrist watch
Time's money I get mine 'round the clock
I promise 'til I see a mill' I'll never stop
Fuck doin' time I spent mine chasin' guap
Fucks in the sideline from the cell block
Fuck losin' myself, I'm a sure shot
This automatic get me mo' than one shot
I'm like a addict: addicted to takin' what these niggas got
I'm a hundred and ten percenter ???
My life's been documented a current event/vet
I'm patiently waiting anxiously burnin' you bitch
I put that work in, I deserve what I get, G-Unit!
I stay strapped with the fith
If it ain't in my lab it's stashed in the whip
I love her with a passion, she blast when I trip
When she lonely she ask me to fill up her clip

[Refrain]Lyrics to You Know What It Is [feat. KD Aubert]

Fought it like a killer bee
Watch me how I kill this shit
Can tell with what I'm working with
... is my nourishment
You know what it is
Money my curse
... embarrass me
Like they wanna honor me
They ain't got to honor me
I ain't got to honor bitch
... you know what it is
Now I'm getting all of it
You know what it is [repeats]

... the way she shakes that ass
You know what it is
It's my swag
My...
My car
The money
It's the way I'm...
Make these beautiful bitches love me
You know what it is
It's the Burberry cologne spray
... 15 miles... we ain't stopping until...

You know what it is [repeats]

It's the black Gucci belt
With the black Gucci...
You know what it is
... murder it's all I got...
Ménage a trois...
You know what it is [repeats]

It's my diamonds...
I know they... on me like...
You know what it is
... I'm innocent
And my mouth still talks this shit
... you know what it is

You know what it is [repeats][Intro]
Where you at Water?

[E-40]
I'm trapped in my own mind and I'm trapped like I'm in bondage
Now, everybody ain't eating, some of us hungry like a hostage
Messing 'round get a bleaking, with them 30-round car tricks
To the right we playing, we'd do anything to get fetti
California reality, with a California mentality
Pushing wait like calories to collect our salaries
Pimping pink toes, like Nikki, Marge and Valerie
(Who you allergic to?) I'm allergic to suckers, mind my allergy

[Hook: Sevin]
This is for the West Side, West Side
This is for the West Side, West Side
This is for the West Side, West Side
This is for the West Side, West Side
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California

[40 Glocc]
Look at these California Chucks with these California strings
With California dickies with these California T's
Say the wrong thing get hit with them California knees
I come from the land of them California G's
Catch me, Big U, Humpty sipping California lean
And if you really really join my California team
We some real B's and some California C's
Oh you didn't know? It's a California thing

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Where the big C's cripping and the low-lows be dipping
And the laws keep tripping, but you know we do it our way
Californa-a-yay, West like Kanye
From G's to boys to [?] singing like [?]
Gangster shit with a cute bitch
She want a blunt, then count money and talk shit, you'z a trick
You wanna know my bitch dress size?
Then break bread or fake date, this is for the best side, the West Side

[Hook]

[Too Short]
Welcome to the bay mayne (bitch)
You a long way from LA mayne (bitch)
But it's just as dangerous
No Crips and Bloods, but the shit don't change that much
Niggas still representing, throw it up
You can't have a good time if you don't know enough
Cause Cali girls like to show that stuff
And us Oakland niggas, we have em ho'ing up

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
California plates on my California Phantom
Up on that California kush up in Cali swerving
California earthquakes, California sunshine
Caught up in that twist, call it California wartime
California politics and California consequences
Bitches be flocking to California, flipping like pigeons
California brand fully automatic weapon
California kid to a California legend
When Cali get together watch how California ball
Show some California love, put some plaques up on the wall
California scream for the Golden State Warriors
Born in Detroit but made in California

[Hook][40 Glocc]
I move on my instincts and practice by what I preach
A bullet'll make you think, I'm fuller then Hennessey
When I pull it, I pop it off, popping all at your car
Smashing off in the dark, through traffic I'm what you call
A gangsta that break them laws, a gangsta that keep it all
Hood out in public, sagging, showing my drawers
When my pistol by my pelvis, this ain't just another song
It's a muthafucking anthem
I got my hand up on my balls, smoking on a cancer
Fucking up my lungs, hitting niggas up like where the fuck you from
Acting like you strapped, nigga, where the fucking gun
Niggas quick to make a scene, the scene when the cops come
So you hit 'em with that beam to the spleen and blood you lost
Leave 'em sleeping on the street, choking on his own blood
Just coating this no love, this fucking thing know what's up
Respect is when you see us, so them choppers'll wet you up

[Chorus 2x: 40 Glocc]
Dipping on low bros and traffic in slow mo'
Just me and my pistol, I keep a she under clothes
I love it just like my kids, treat her just like my bitch
Need her, she keep a clip, I'm anxious to see her spit

[Havoc]
I get it, how I can get it, but never selling my soul
Can get it, how I wanna get it, I come the pistol
Keep her with me, she needy, don't wanna be left alone
What's the sense to leave her home, fuck around, I'm a danger
She concealed til a nigga show his ass, I reveal her
Have you looking down the barrel, like you looking in the mirror
Have you lying face down, but you hear me little clearer
Got a little bad news, and guess who the bearer?
It's her, that bitch, that chrome four fifth
Your wrist looking blue, I'm on that brisk
You next in line, you on that list
Put that pistol in your mouth, give her a big fat kiss
When I'm anxious, and dangerous, to be around here
This here, Eddie Grier, muthafucka, I'm near
With that shiny bitch, that grimy bitch
And best believe, yo, she ain't no model bitch

[Chorus 2x][Intro: 40 Glocc]
Light up that marijuana
Pass me the bong
Fill up my cup
Fill it up with Patron
Suuuun

[Verse 1: Sun]
We just came to party
And I'm feelin' good
I got the Remy for any women that's feeling loose
Your man grillin' and he just up on my tennis shoes
I think we met, we gettin' checks like (???)
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue

[Verse 2: Village Boo]
I just came to party
Pulled up
In my old school, with the naughty
Valet park
My shit, next to 40's
TipToe)
In the Coup, he look sporty (He ridin' three piece)
And I'm tryin' to leave tonight, with at least three freaks
Hit the room, you know, until I skeet, skeet
I hope these clowns in here ain't tryin' to start beef
Cause that'll be the reason that niggas kickin' your front teeth

[Hook: Eminem]
We just came to party
We ain't comin' hear to
Start shit with nobody

He done tripped into this
Cup, and spilt it on me
Now, he's startin' on some
Shit, this with the naughty
He's about to get the
Shit, kicked, (???) out of him

[Verse 2: TipToe]
I don't got no time for these niggas that's playing games
I don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name
I'm a bad influence, I smoke weed in front of kids
I crack a bottle open and ask 'em
If they wanna swig
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife
TipToe ain't nothin' nice
I rob Benz's and still sport a gang of ice
We gettin' money, we ain't trippin' off you ho niggas
Cause if we want you, we'll come show up at your show, niggas

[Verse 3 Jayo Felony]
He 'bout to get the
Shit kicked the fucked out of 'em
They call me 1 Shot killin the Crips is lovin' 'em

Head for the pushin' and shovin' 'em
So crazy
I harass and embarrass him in public 'em
Just sayin'
Hit a stick that get a guerilla pissin' me with that is Crip
I could get sick as I wanna get, cause you know I'm the shit
Never sound like an amateur, I damage niggas' brains
This buster
Came to be a party pooper, I'm insane

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Niqle]
Got a couple of handguns, feel like my block is ready
And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it
I'll die for it and do federal time for it
I'm a inglewood nigga just had me angry brother
I am starting gangbanging because of my favorite color
I done flip the whole brick
I'm flippin' this cocaine
Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train

[Verse 5: 40 Glocc]
The party don't pop off, unless we pop up in it
If the drama jump off, the first to dive up in it
Infamous/G-Unit it, baby, Shady, Aftermath
I done started my own shit, Zoo Life about to crack
Bloods and Crips, they love me (I get my point across)
Bang on the nigga that's phony ((???) sauce)
Pick up the phone with the police
And he was tryin' to kick it, but nigga's got cold feet
YAH!

So I continue the saga!
Move out the path of the lava, move in position and conquer!

You cannot solve with a trigger, this is a pivotal moment!
This is my time of atoning, this is my world and I own it!
So come and take if you want it! - Please God forgive me for sinnin'

Aiyo, son be easy, got some shit that leave 'em internally sleepy

Holding they guns, plus I stay on one like Big Pun
Dum-didi-dum, didi-dum, here I come
Bringing trouble too, it's a lyrical murder serving you
Champion, the rapping don, a/k/a Scorpion
Drop a bomb, now it's on, L-Long, forty block
Freaker neater, hit the club, we gon' keep shit hot
You my bitch, nigga move, you got beef, yo, how we do
Violate things, make you switch up and get a new name
Close shot, let me find out, you got a new game
Reload, try to hit 'em up, with even more pain
Picasso, fuck around and drive 'em all insane
Drive 'em all insane, drive 'em all insane

[40 Glocc]
I'm on the east chilling, without a vest
I pack a pack of pro-b-black, and yo, I'm ready for sex
I'm a West Coast vet, you can ask Rocks the World, who rocks the best
And you best to pick the right fucking Glocc to test
With yo locks and techs, where I'm from, it ain't option nigga
You either do, or get done
Big like Big Pun, and pop like Re-Run
With two guns, watch you do a damn C and run
For a life force, this thug shit runs through my balls
And veins, I'm leaving with a boss shit stain
I smack you out the ground with low range, nigga
I run with a gang that blast to maintain
It's the same thing, popping off both coasts, lost the dope
It's all about the nigga with the biggest paws
Laws being broken, get you searched, super soaken
I'm representing potent, Californ-I-A
Where niggas gang bang and serve 'caine every day
You getting layed flat on your back from the raid I spray
Fucking roaches, niggas is players not coaches
Turn on your TV, DV's the dopest

[Chorus: Whiteboy]
Things are nothing
Boy will dead, and everybody will rotten
Send them our airplane, send them our mountain
Fucking with the real nigga, real killa
See for ear to my nodding
Me yell out things in Latin
Boy will dead, and everybody will rotten
Send them our airplane, send them our mountain
Fucking with the real nigga, real killa
See for ear to my nodding

[Ill Knob]
Yo, word is bond, we keep it gangsta, while dropping lyrics on these wankstas
Mad deep on both coasts, my whole crew'll shank ya
Stop on many tracks, putting holes all in they back
Or leave 'em choking, Rocks the World forever keep it smoking
We the, cream of the crop, let me show you how to pop, nigga
What's cracking, it's Ill Knob about to make it happen
Rocking Glocks, techs, drinking Heinekens and Beck's
Push a seventy on Sunset, we rock for these checks
It be like, Tony Montana, taking trips down in Havana
It be the rap that wanna rhymer, in Bahamas with ya baby mama
Ill Knob, I eat 'em up like Jeffrey Dahmer, bring the drama
And I'mma knock the fighting till tomorrow
Sun I'm, off the heezy, yeah the Knob style is greasy
To some niggas it's hard, but to me, nigga, it's easy
From Brooklyn to Virginia, niggas know I get up in ya
And skin ya, chop 'em up and fry 'em up for dinner

[Whiteboy]
Nigga I will bend ya, or send you to your maker
I'm a West Coast heartbreaker, stand away from salt shaker
I Rocks the World on the low-low, lace this rhyme track by JoJo
I'm smoking dough dough with no lo'
Whoa, ho, I ain't no trip
I'm slick and equisite, and good with the diz-ick
My boys from South Central, and I'm loving Bed-Stuy
Brooklyn, yeah it's true, the crook's gem
They heart blood in, razor cutting, what the fucking
Everybody's busting, I relate to these cats in more ways than one
West Coast, here I come, if you a killer, where's your gun?
Where I come from, I don't need a buck fifty
Before I start cut in one motion, I been busting

Never sound like an amateur, I damage niggas' brains
This buster
Came to be a party pooper, I'm insane

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Niqle]
Got a couple of handguns, feel like my block is ready
And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it
I'll die for it and do federal time for it
I'm a inglewood nigga just had me angry brother
I am starting gangbanging because of my favorite color
I done flip the whole brick
I'm flippin' this cocaine
Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train

[Verse 5: 40 Glocc]
The party don't pop off, unless we pop up in it
If the drama jump off, the first to dive up in it
Infamous/G-Unit it, baby, Shady, Aftermath
I done started my own shit, Zoo Life about to crack
Bloods and Crips, they love me (I get my point across)
Bang on the nigga that's phony ((???) sauce)
Pick up the phone with the police
And he was tryin' to kick it, but nigga's got cold feet
YAH!

[Hook]x2

[Verse 5: 40 Glocc]
ZOO LIFE!
INFAMOUS!
G-UNIT!
SHADY!
AFTERMATH!
BIOTCH![Intro]
Where you at Water?

[E-40]
I'm trapped in my own mind and I'm trapped like I'm in bondage
Now, everybody ain't eating, some of us hungry like a hostage
Messing 'round get a bleaking, with them 30-round car tricks
To the right we playing, we'd do anything to get fetti
California reality, with a California mentality
Pushing wait like calories to collect our salaries
Pimping pink toes, like Nikki, Marge and Valerie
(Who you allergic to?) I'm allergic to suckers, mind my allergy

[Hook: Sevin]
This is for the West Side, West Side
This is for the West Side, West Side
This is for the West Side, West Side
This is for the West Side, West Side
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California

[40 Glocc]
Look at these California Chucks with these California strings
With California dickies with these California T's
Say the wrong thing get hit with them California knees
I come from the land of them California G's
Catch me, Big U, Humpty sipping California lean
And if you really really join my California team
We some real B's and some California C's
Oh you didn't know? It's a California thing

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Where the big C's cripping and the low-lows be dipping
And the laws keep tripping, but you know we do it our way
Californa-a-yay, West like Kanye
From G's to boys to [?] singing like [?]
Gangster shit with a cute bitch
She want a blunt, then count money and talk shit, you'z a trick
You wanna know my bitch dress size?
Then break bread or fake date, this is for the best side, the West Side

[Hook]

[Too Short]
Welcome to the bay mayne (bitch)
You a long way from LA mayne (bitch)
But it's just as dangerous
No Crips and Bloods, but the shit don't change that much
Niggas still representing, throw it up
You can't have a good time if you don't know enough
Cause Cali girls like to show that stuff
And us Oakland niggas, we have em ho'ing up

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
California plates on my California Phantom
Up on that California kush up in Cali swerving
California earthquakes, California sunshine
Caught up in that twist, call it California wartime
California politics and California consequences
Bitches be flocking to California, flipping like pigeons
California brand fully automatic weapon
California kid to a California legend
When Cali get together watch how California ball
Show some California love, put some plaques up on the wall
California scream for the Golden State Warriors
Born in Detroit but made in California

[Hook][40 Glocc]
I move on my instincts and practice by what I preach
A bullet'll make you think, I'm fuller then Hennessey
When I pull it, I pop it off, popping all at your car
Smashing off in the dark, through traffic I'm what you call
A gangsta that break them laws, a gangsta that keep it all
Hood out in public, sagging, showing my drawers
When my pistol by my pelvis, this ain't just another song
It's a muthafucking anthem
I got my hand up on my balls, smoking on a cancer
Fucking up my lungs, hitting niggas up like where the fuck you from
Acting like you strapped, nigga, where the fucking gun
Niggas quick to make a scene, the scene when the cops come
So you hit 'em with that beam to the spleen and blood you lost
Leave 'em sleeping on the street, choking on his own blood
Just coating this no love, this fucking thing know what's up
Respect is when you see us, so them choppers'll wet you up

[Chorus 2x: 40 Glocc]
Dipping on low bros and traffic in slow mo'
Just me and my pistol, I keep a she under clothes
I love it just like my kids, treat her just like my bitch
Need her, she keep a clip, I'm anxious to see her spit

[Havoc]
I get it, how I can get it, but never selling my soul
Can get it, how I wanna get it, I come the pistol
Keep her with me, she needy, don't wanna be left alone
What's the sense to leave her home, fuck around, I'm a danger
She concealed til a nigga show his ass, I reveal her
Have you looking down the barrel, like you looking in the mirror
Have you lying face down, but you hear me little clearer
Got a little bad news, and guess who the bearer?
It's her, that bitch, that chrome four fifth
Your wrist looking blue, I'm on that brisk
You next in line, you on that list
Put that pistol in your mouth, give her a big fat kiss
When I'm anxious, and dangerous, to be around here
This here, Eddie Grier, muthafucka, I'm near
With that shiny bitch, that grimy bitch
And best believe, yo, she ain't no model bitch

[Chorus 2x][Suga Free]
Dollar bill y'all
Shit
Somethin' I can feel, y'all
Why you bullshittin'
Shadow on the 619

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Oh, here motherfucker, since you wanna go fetch
On my worst day, you couldn't fuck with me at your best
I know you hate it when I show up (Show up)
Tow up
Probably cause you know I break a bitch and I'm about to blow up
Now it's ho season
Motherfuckin' so why bitch
That you hatin' and contemplatin' on a real pimp for no apparent reason
That I beat the situation and I'm hot
Recognized that you hatin', cause I got them trick waitin'
Back to back, fuck a 'Llac
And a rat, like that
Oh, you fuckin' with a pimp
And you will get slapped
That's what a pimp do
Break you
And get rid of you
And make you tell 'em other players what I did to you
You bitch, you ho, you slut
Better recognize game before I fuck you up
Now what you waitin' for?
I'll let a bitch pimp me when pushed
You don't sell no more and make dildos out of playdough

Chorus: Suga Free
If, you, don't
Leave me, alone
I'm, gone
Lock you in that little bitty box again, bitch
If, you, don't
Leave me, alone
I'm, gone
Lock you in that, lock you in that (Little bitty box again, bitch)
Little bitty box again

[Verse 2: 40 Glocc]
I had a bad ass bitch with a caramel tone
So I put my back in my bone, and mack in my tone
Told her, "Shut the fuck up," and sit in the back of the broom
Snatch my cheese up quick and kick the back with a shroom
Cause we don't love them hoes and
A bitch ain't worth a shit with no gold
So I hit the club to cop more
Y'all know
It's Suga Free and 40 Glocc in Dego
With Mr. Shadow all the way from Colton to Seattle
And back to Pomona
Hoes to promote the corner
Hit me on my two-way Motorola
I got a whole lot of soldiers that love to throw boulders
It's all over, test the faith and bleed slower
The heat Blaze Just that fast, give me Hovah
I want the cash and the ice and the keys to the Rover
Tricky gotta kick cheese to meet, nigga, to ball, blow up
Biotch

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mr. Shadow]
I said, "She's A Ho
Her friend's a ho"
If you ain't about trickin', then your ass gotta go
From the open toe pumps to the way that you move
I'm a show you how a ese from the S.D. do
Straight act a fool, got you making me loot
Got you standing on the corner and that ass look cute
And you know when the fuck I'm comin' 'round the block
With the homey So G, Suga Free and 40 Glocc
It don't stop, we stay pimpin'
Bitch, why you trippin'
Don't hate the playa, hate the game
You damn chicken
Stickin', no lickin'
That's the motto
And boy, the life I life
Is hard to swallow
Make your shit hollow, real quick, don't try to follow
So pimp playa, pit bosses smokin' in a hot model
Don Shadow, makin' ya bitch clip tricks
She employee of the month when it comes to servin' dicks
Ha ha

Repeat Chorus[J Steez]

There's
I, can't let it fly
No
Not as long as it needs
Not as long as it keeps

[Verse 1: Young Brown (40 Glocc in background)]
Breathe easy
Life is a gift, homie, believe me
See, I'm a wrap/rap it up and pass it on through this J Steez beat
They said I been asleep
But I got vision and hunger
And musically, I could see eye-to-eye with Stevie Wonder
I do it for my people
Follow me with a faith of a Hebrew
Look, listen, it's (???) rappin' is deeper
I'm running game, making dough, build my fucking cake
And you running out of breath like you want a shake
Make way, I'm chiselling haters off me
Hustle my way to the top
Make 'em bounce to the heart beat
Hook up the 40, homie, pass me the pistol, the pisto
Yeah, you ready holmes? (Yeah, yeah, I'm listo)
Only one way I can go from here, it ain't down
And there's nothing that I really fear, I'm Young Brown
Perfectin' myself and I'm repin' brown, I'm So. Cal
And you ask me why I take a while, I'm ready now

Chorus: Singer
I, can't let 'em down, no
Not as long as it needs (Yeah, yeah)
Not as long as it keeps (There's)
I, can't let 'em down, no
Not as long as it needs (Yeah, yeah)
Not as long as it keeps (There's)

[Verse 2: 40 Glocc]
All my life
All I wanted was some
Money in my pocket
And food in my stomach
Thinkin' any problem, I done just 'bout done it
Made a living out of robbin' niggas, spur of the moment
I put my faith in my pen to get me out of the hood
When I die, I let my kids know I did what I could
Escapin' the pen, got me knocking on wood
All the money in the world could take my love from the hood
Drinking vodka til I hurl, keep me feeling good
When times get bad, it'd help to get me a push
I got the coast (The coast)
On both of my shoulders (Both of them)
Hoping if I die, I don't go unnoticed
I'm fully focused, asleep with my eyes open
When I think of getting caught
I'm a go out like a soldier
I got plans (Got plans)
And won't be dead for a moment
I'm a make the best of it and watch time pass over

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
Been a long road before the boy caught fire
Lot of stop signs, caught a lot of flat tires
Lot of hearts broke cause a lot of chicks flip
A lot of dope made, man, a lot of stakes stick
Raised by the son, like a seed in the Earth
Seen plenty homies shot, left, bleed in the dirt
Free, made it through, some leaving in herre
Since niggas wanna head, they give me G's for a verse
A life full of pain in exchange for cake
Doubt what I'm about, I rearrange your face
Doubt what I'm about, I squeezed the two
My minds need help, gotta please the jewel
Must sell units, make cheese for doing
If I don't (Clack, clack)
I'm a need your jewels
So when the tough get goin', the tough get to it
To sell a couple dollars, niggas come with break fluid

Repeat Chorus[Intro: Champ Diva]
Uh uh, turn me up a little, word up, word up
Uh uh, juice it, juice it
What what, new millennium, new millennium
Yeah, yeah, what, what, what
Huh, feel me on this one, uh, uh

[Champ Diva]
Aiyo, son be easy, got some shit that leave 'em internally sleepy
Like Biggie, they can't see me
Holding they guns, plus I stay on one like Big Pun
Dum-didi-dum, didi-dum, here I come
Bringing trouble too, it's a lyrical murder serving you
Champion, the rapping don, a/k/a Scorpion
Drop a bomb, now it's on, L-Long, forty block
Freaker neater, hit the club, we gon' keep shit hot
You my bitch, nigga move, you got beef, yo, how we do
Violate things, make you switch up and get a new name
Close shot, let me find out, you got a new game
Reload, try to hit 'em up, with even more pain
Picasso, fuck around and drive 'em all insane
Drive 'em all insane, drive 'em all insane

[40 Glocc]
I'm on the east chilling, without a vest
I pack a pack of pro-b-black, and yo, I'm ready for sex
I'm a West Coast vet, you can ask Rocks the World, who rocks the best
And you best to pick the right fucking Glocc to test
With yo locks and techs, where I'm from, it ain't option nigga
You either do, or get done
Big like Big Pun, and pop like Re-Run
With two guns, watch you do a damn C and run
For a life force, this thug shit runs through my balls
And veins, I'm leaving with a boss shit stain
I smack you out the ground with low range, nigga
I run with a gang that blast to maintain
It's the same thing, popping off both coasts, lost the dope
It's all about the nigga with the biggest paws
Laws being broken, get you searched, super soaken
I'm representing potent, Californ-I-A
Where niggas gang bang and serve 'caine every day
You getting layed flat on your back from the raid I spray
Fucking roaches, niggas is players not coaches
Turn on your TV, DV's the dopest

[Chorus: Whiteboy]
Things are nothing
Boy will dead, and everybody will rotten
Send them our airplane, send them our mountain
Fucking with the real nigga, real killa
See for ear to my nodding
Me yell out things in Latin
Boy will dead, and everybody will rotten
Send them our airplane, send them our mountain
Fucking with the real nigga, real killa
See for ear to my nodding

[Ill Knob]
Yo, word is bond, we keep it gangsta, while dropping lyrics on these wankstas
Mad deep on both coasts, my whole crew'll shank ya
Stop on many tracks, putting holes all in they back
Or leave 'em choking, Rocks the World forever keep it smoking
We the, cream of the crop, let me show you how to pop, nigga
What's cracking, it's Ill Knob about to make it happen
Rocking Glocks, techs, drinking Heinekens and Beck's
Push a seventy on Sunset, we rock for these checks
It be like, Tony Montana, taking trips down in Havana
It be the rap that wanna rhymer, in Bahamas with ya baby mama
Ill Knob, I eat 'em up like Jeffrey Dahmer, bring the drama
And I'mma knock the fighting till tomorrow
Sun I'm, off the heezy, yeah the Knob style is greasy
To some niggas it's hard, but to me, nigga, it's easy
From Brooklyn to Virginia, niggas know I get up in ya
And skin ya, chop 'em up and fry 'em up for dinner

[Whiteboy]
Nigga I will bend ya, or send you to your maker
I'm a West Coast heartbreaker, stand away from salt shaker
I Rocks the World on the low-low, lace this rhyme track by JoJo
I'm smoking dough dough with no lo'
Whoa, ho, I ain't no trip
I'm slick and equisite, and good with the diz-ick
My boys from South Central, and I'm loving Bed-Stuy
Brooklyn, yeah it's true, the crook's gem
They heart blood in, razor cutting, what the fucking
Everybody's busting, I relate to these cats in more ways than one
West Coast, here I come, if you a killer, where's your gun?
Where I come from, I don't need a buck fifty
Before I start cut in one motion, I been busting

Infa, infa
Infamous
Up in this bitch
Infa-infa
Infamous
Up in this

(Verse 1)
I'm the king of the coast, I'm a rider for real
Dickies, T-shirts, that's my deal
Keep my peripheral in my rearview
Step in the club
And do that one-two
Infamous G's
Do what they want to
Move in a unit
Like we 'posed to
Watch ya step
Don't get too close, fools
Matter of fact
It's past your curfew
You dealin' with grown men, these hands'll hurt you
With crumbs off of my table, my homey'll murk you
Your life was adopted, you could say, I'll birth you
The nail in the coffin
Straight to your torso
BLIP-BLIP-BLOW
Ain't you dead yet?
I knew he had bitch in them the day we first met
Pussy was bleeding
I gave him a cold test
Hit his ass up
Nigga, this cold grip
I'm already gone
Over half a state
I created ya life
And this the thanks I get?
My chain and my neck represent the set
Yellin' Guerilla Unit, cuz
Beating my chest
Feelin' hella buzzed, off of liquor and blunts
Treating everyday like the first of the month
With a pocket full of stones, still served in a cup
And a fitted twenty pack, right hand on my gun
Uh

Chorus:
[Sam Scarfo] You ain't really that deep
You ain't bangin' no heat
You don't really want beef, where them hammers at
[Both]       BLAO, BLAO, BLAO!
[Sam Scarfo] Where them hammers at
[Both]       BLAO, BLAO, BLAO!
[Sam Scarfo] Where them hammers at
Calico, mack 10, A.K., everything
Shorty whop, 40 Glocc
Homey, what you gotta say?
[40 Glocc]   It's on, nigga
[Sam Scarfo] Where them hammers at
[Both]       BLAO, BLAO, BLAO!
[Sam Scarfo] Where them hammers at

(Verse 2)
I moved out the hood
Straight to the 'burbs
Keep my ear to the street like I sleep on the curb
Put my feet to your hair piece to get on your nerves
Drink liquor til I'm pissy
I must concur
Dump til the clip empty, watch the outcome occur
Treating trouble like pussy divin in, head first
I fill that boy up from the head on down
Turn a crooked-ass frown
Upside down
Keep heat in my pants
Like a STD
Ridin' shotgun in V.I.P., SUV
I'm S-U-P
R-E-M-E
Do a driveby in daylight like big Tray Dee
When I yell out, "Peace"
I want a piece of the pie
Or I'm a use the doo-wap to knock a piece at ya thigh
It's hard to stay alive, niggas, easy to die
Now analyze my life and try to walk in my nights
Let's see how many bullets, you could die tonight
If I die tonight
I'll be remembered
For them throw-away burners with no serial numbers
I'm a felon, homeboy
No registered pistols
If you running from me, homie
That lead'll get you
