[Verse 1: Pusha T]
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with a-
'Nother bitch, ménage
Boomerang, Strange'
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Your hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bel grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
Y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
Half gold, we got a hand on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!

[Verse 2: Bryant Dope]
I got flames for your download link
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Well packaged to distribute to the masters
Plotted this since first grade classes
Class is elements of a classic
I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says "what's up?"

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a [?], wish upon a star
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
Cause if music and money is the motive then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin'
I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: Retch]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', it still got me goin'
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke but tell Butter roll a blunt
Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own shit and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try em
He'll call me Retch but your bitch call me Bryan
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm draggin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin'?
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trainers cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds, [?] all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine [?] and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in LA with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit
Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
4 gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' shit
Avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to reign
Loving the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of hell's kitchen praying he don't stick from the stove
God got me, illum-i-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
'Bout 150
Let me tell y'all now, I want Nicki
Lift her up high up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (what)
Keep fresh just in margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (naw)
[?] niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
But know it's over since I was [?]
You nervous like I thought you seen [?]
Got everybody thanking me
[?]
I'm a boss [?]
[?]
[?]
Cause I'm a mad man
Fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more 45's and 9s, I ain't talking bout no J's
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter
[?]
Riding shotty in the chevy [?] know as a Krueger
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy used to call the police
Get it good girl, use your knees
I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (for real)
Back on my Compton shit
Demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (what)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(CHECK!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's 2 or 3 and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice-cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key
Bitch we great, bitch we great, fuckin' set
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get it, we gotta get it, we gonna take it
Bitch we jump, say bitch we jump, we gotta make it
Couple racks up on them [?]
Your bitch here smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga
All I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga
Mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal
N.Y., them eagles
Fly through, get high too
Fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group
Come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin
Boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun pounding
Keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me
Me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up,  that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up
Hennessy, Louie V
Me and you, me and her
We as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one
Freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since 8 and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like "nigga don't move"
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk [?] like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado] x2
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, "What's good?"
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room
Legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon?
All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack
Just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening
Now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls
Redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up
Wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor
Burning monks to [?]
Part of the action
Retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them
Watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun
Is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, 3 grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want I'm a zombie bitch I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo prada never gonna pile up
If you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meech]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know
Niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lector
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible
I've been on my mind for days
Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill king
To get their shot, [?]
I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
When I need bread, I'm like "Fuck the rest"
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game
Let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, "no way"
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real west side nigga, [?]
Might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
[?] put me high [?]
You can do that, flyin', fuck, do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on [?]
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Eric Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the mac truck bulletproof'ed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz?
My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once
No voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 011 011
Hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Beamer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Nina's
Instead, I was that nigga puffin reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga then drip of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the work she see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome
Your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back
Cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb
And I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man
I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame
I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride
Hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die
Pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest
[?] chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say "fuck fate"
If I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to
While I'm fine dining on YouTube
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with an Onyx [?] on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing
These rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter
1-2, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something
I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable
Make shine sit on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body
Fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up
I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
Ti'l all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry
In backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger!
Y'all got me drunk as hell
Now I been rich since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your diction is lack, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, you get a rollie, rollie
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see you serve foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody to eat but her
She but like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Cut them then we benefit, cut them then we send them into
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my golds, they all on my seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe rings, featured by me
Bitches know it's time out
They be fucking me so good, I be like 'Time out!'
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
She stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like 'Time out!'
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant ?, she tall like 'Zilla
I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo in another color
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked in no pajamas
Lil' homie ran off with lots of numbers
And for that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a pill together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my things together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Michael Montana
My ? say I got stamina
I cooking the Hannah Montana
I bury these hoes like Santas do
I kill every one of my features
I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yella bands
Just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian [?]
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing "daddy's home"
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it
And right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh
My nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day hundred
Cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit
You just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out, Pasadena, Kansas state
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar
Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face
Hoes like "he so angry", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you
Real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit
It's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: SL Jones]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Look like [?] we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes
I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit
Pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader
Still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa?
Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster
World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga
That's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
It's everyone goes, they can suck a [?]
We have another song, I won't fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka
Happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social [?]
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh
Got those motherfucking custom Roshes
Feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit
My Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson
I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic
Paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt
Three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the philly
My daughter's neck is chilly
My son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut
Look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
Ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep
That's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I;m ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, i'm spending
You lames and you fall, i'm like 2 Chainz when i ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
And [?] sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
[?] what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em
Never write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched
And your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressing
Scorin' high off the [?]
Brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good
I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper
And she gave me the sloppy gooooood
So you should tip her if you execute
Young leisure suit
[?] with no extra loot
My ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemy
Yo what's up, see me on [?] tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
[?] zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz] x2

Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need a thing, a thing, then I got it right here
[?] I got it right here, I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
Most of these niggas gon' hate
Me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon' swing
We all gon' catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap
Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase
But I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time
You ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die
I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh
Big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending
Been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
[?] we gettin' it
With that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a [?] to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris
And free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off [?]
Rottweiler just to watch 'em
Maybachs for the profit
Get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers
Press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing
[?] the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne
And a 3 page spread
Y'all was sleepin' on the flow just a couple months later
Now y'all purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, go for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
[?] a monk, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be into me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A black claimed king
Respect the illustrator
Don't you dare try the Elohim of flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up trick
Put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, [?]
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
[?] check up, haters still [?]
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
[?] came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn
The fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm
All but the limousine, swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene
Yeah that's a Spit sixteen
Hearts inside of my tip jar
Like a bleeding beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin'
Then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like [?]
I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans
Go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross
For all of that fifteen minute fame
But I'ma get my [?]
And the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip
And just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit  with a pistol
[?] full of [?], I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My ? on a eastside ho ?????
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it
Flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it
Running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get "Faith" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID
Game leave me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some [?]
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
[?] throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', "Oh well"
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blastin' naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Man didn't chief
My sons of sons'll sandwich the beef
We get loot, always scram from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know?
So much wax in this bitch, smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
[?]
Nah, fuck that
Bring them [?] back
[?]
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it
[?] I'm the greatest, carve a statue of my face, bitch[Intro: Vic Mensa]
Ay Trip, where that smoke at?
Let me hit that bitch one time
Bless me, yeah
Stanky man
Boi 1da, INNANET, INNANET-NET-NET-NET-Nuh

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I was losin' it, lost in the dark, but I found my lighthouse
I like when it rains in the spring
Light a J better seen with the lights, oh
(Dolo) Speakers in the Mac back like Rose like Mike, no
I know in the end niggas left, but I guess it's all alright, no
I mean, I know all them, their armors in that science ain't it
Prolly the reason my people's pupils so dilated
If you gon' die, might as well die young
Tryin' to be optimistic with the politicians
Cut schools, buy guns, but when the shots is lickin' at the ones that'll lose they son
Instead they send 'em to private schools and pull back on public funds
While functioning as if they could begin to fathom where the fuck we comin' from
Sometimes I hold my tongue, talkin' feels useless
I used to point in circles for wasted years lost in excuses
Time is money, every second I spent in high-school clockin'
Should've been on the road fuckin' with hoes, fallin' through holes in my pockets
But everything happens for a reason
If you choose to look at it that way
And put truth into the things you do
And really believe what you say
They say the darkest night comes before the brightest morning
I like to think I'd ask the right things if God was right before me
Like, why you let babies get shot while babies is killin'?
All because the system that raised me from grade school made me the villain
Barely out of my momma's crib
Can't even tie my own laces
Just moved into a brand new place
But somehow I still miss my basement
I guess the thing about lookin' back is you can't change leavin'
And I guess the thing about judgin' the past is that it just ain't even

[Hook: Vic Mensa & Beldina]
I know that money makes the world go 'round
Money makes the world go 'round
But don't forget it when you get it
My pops told me, told me, "Make money
But the money you make don't make you"
Make money, but the money you make don't make you
Make money, but the money you make don't make you
Make money, but the money you make don't make you

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Save money, hope the money you save could save you
Silk my sheets set in sace my sugar for my table
Too easy readin' people, tweetin', tweakin' like they hate you
But what's even easier is callin' your mom just to say thank you
Could've been the one that never dropped
Could've been the one that got shot
Could've never seen what it means to be mean
Be trapped in a box
Strapped in a box Chevy with lil' Eddie back home on the block
Blockin' the sunlight
It's like a solar eclipse in my city in the middle of a gunfight
Straight shots hit kids in the dark
That's the way it is like Walter Cronkite
Drunk off of the thrill, I feel like shootin' back in the distance
Prolly bounce off of a light pole and kill a fuckin' kid in the kitchen
Kissin' the past goodbye
Buyin' a stairway to heaven cause in time we all have to die
I just know when my time comes I'mma have made mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, Sir Rockie I'm smoked out, but I'm grindin'
I'm never weed windin', but reclinin' while remindin'
You I'mma keep my foot on these pun niggas neck
Stay on the road like some wheels and a board and a deck
Young nigga wildin', gotta give respect
Rollie on my arm, I'm the one they elect
I got that fire flow, I'm the one they detect
Gotta get the check, these niggas wanna say, "Turn up"
But then they turn up and then they earn what?
Nothin', they frontin'
Here we go, we're the topic of discussion
Fresh nigga, but the flow is disgustin'
And the money come fast cause I run with the nigga that made
Every day we hustlin'
It's like we came with the master plan
Not just talk, but the cash in hand
Make a animorph into no-mans-land
We could make 100 grand just like no man can
But every time I sit and watch the weekend news
See how many people in the weekend lose
It give the boy the blues, fuck all these clothes and shoes
Motivation what they could use and I got it

[Hook][Produced by Tone P]

[Intro: Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I groom better
Like I'm under a goal post, I am too official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick, haha
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though, try to hit the Jummah
Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said "you winning, why BOA pray so much?"
I say "you tripping, such winnin make niggas prey on us"
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

[Interlude: Wale]
Folarin in this motherfucker

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, aw, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas, I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don’t be a statistic
Have yo main bitch sending me pictures
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah, nigga I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If you're a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole World, zip your coat up tight, I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young C.O.L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, oh, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot, Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a helluva start

Cole... World... nigga
Double M-G, Dreamville shit

[Hook: Wale][Intro: Rick Ross] + (T-Pain)
She self made too, therefore she winning
New Money, MMG, Self Made 2
Taking over the world
C’mon baby girl let’s spend this money

[Hook x2: Rick Ross & T-Pain]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin

[Interlude: Rick Ross & T-Pain] + (Wale)
She got me caught up in the moment (You got some nice pineapples, for real)
She got me caught up in the moment (Wale though, double M, remix)
I only kiss her when she on it
White Ferrari and she got her doin' donuts, hol' up

[Verse 1: Wale]
She like Wa-le my stroke game be on point
Yeah, shawty losing her mind her composure most of her voice
And she say she hate the word moist, but she can't escape from that vibe
You can play fight with that cat, me, I kill that pussy 9 times
I slow it down, let me slow it down
Ever since I hit that, look at it, that shit I got you poking now
Numbers we ain't throwing down, not me, no way, no how
Cause you know them screenshot broads always gonna run they mouth
Okay, I’m far too drunk I’m not driving (what’s up?), you know open bars are on fire
A little green and white in my pocket, so this song is now "Bag of Mara"
Caught up in the wrong timing, yeah, Jacob made my medallion
Just post up, but don’t coach much, but I love the stadium talent

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Bright lights picture, all right colors
I'll let you count my money, don’t think that you own me
You're my bag of my money, you're my bag of honey
I beez in your trap, while you're yelling fuck me
I be on some other shit
Maybach O up in this bitch
Tell you about them other niggas
They be lying about they figures
I’m bout it, bout it I pull the trigger
Y’all be so lame
We killin' the game, I dance in the bank
We so mafioso, you ain't never know though
Never gonna know so, no never no, no, no, no, no, no

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
My bitch amazing; show stopper
Work at the titty club; pussy popper
Top drop white on white 645
I burnt her up from 5 o’clock until 6:45
Mr. 60 minutes, Mrs. Chanel, and Fendi
I hit her in the Porsche and burnt her up a new Infiniti
Presidential Rollie, JFK, she Mrs. Kennedy
Rose gold his or hers, diamonds and furs
Want a little suede, one on one bag
Look like a duffel bag of money, she beyond that
And I’m beyond swag, young thug nigga
Drug dealer; MMG affiliated blood nigga
That 50k on that vaca
20 bands on that birkin bag, 12 hunnid on that dinner date
We eat lobsters from Florida, French-ful flowers
Put you on the next level shit, world is ours

[Verse 4: Rockie Fresh]
Got my Sox cap, top back, shorty you could come outside
We can ride, drive an ’88, you know how we drive
You just want somebody that’s consistent and that will provide
I’m just trying to live in your division when your legs divide
I could take you high, you say your man don’t appreciate you
He should learn to be more grateful for somebody that’s been faithful
Instead he trying to play you, you know trying to Stevie J you
I just wanna make you rain like we in the month of April
And we hella young, let’s have some fun and never be on dummy
Got a good sense of humor, but you can’t be acting funny
You will get ate for dinner, but I’m hungry for some money
Every time I go and get it, then I’ll let you count it for me

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Trina]
I-I-I’m looking like a money money money badge
That’s why these niggas want me bad
Cause I’m so fucking special, diamonds and precious metals
Giuseppe stilettos, I’m the queen of the ghetto
Trina, I stay winning, I keep these niggas spinning
I’m looking for a boss, let me be your lieutenant
Let me be your masseuse, fine head in the coupe
Ménage in the suite, boy, you know I’m the truth
I stay stunning, looking like a bad of hundreds
You know your momma running, I keep that money coming
He bring that money home, he let me count it for him
Now I’m married to the mob and I’m riding for him

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Uh, my-my bitch mad cause I’d rather get that money
I give her this dick she say that dick better than money
I say, "Can I get some head?" She say, "Let me get my scrunchie"
Serve her like a country, got that dope dick she a junkie
She say "Tunechi, this your pussy", I say "Tell me anything"
Then I suck her nipple ring, eat that pussy; Listerine
She coming I make sure my bitch bad; she'll take yours
And she do tricks on that dick like a skateboard

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Uh, Maybach Riders, gold chain buyers
Gold wings saline your bitch say I’m the fliest
I make five thou gold ya’ll, spent that in about an hour
And my bitch like Bob May, ball hard 'til I get the callous
Shout out I ain’t got no stylist, shout out to you niggas keep trying
Bag of money, bag of money, I eat the money like I eat the pussy
King gold chains, they follow me, presidential car presidential suite
She bad and all, model type, but I like me a big booty
One time for them 9 to 5’s, one time for them stripper dimes
One time for them college girls, one time for those who can’t decide
I love her more I take them all, she doing bad I break her off
I’m T-Raw, don’t need ya’ll, everything I do is so well done

[Hook]

[Verse 8: French Montana]
I push the drop and let her ride shotty
My bitch bad looking like a bag of mollies
Hit the crib make a porno, my diamonds flash like photos
500 on my auto and I bought it out; fuck car note
Shorty know exactly who the realest is
Murder that (ahh) leave no witnesses
Started from the streets, turned to businesses
Dirty bag of money, stack it to where that ceiling is
Got, shorty, grab it, take it, to that, money
Shorty, dancing, for them, hundreds, got me, paying, on exonics
Bitch I’m balling all green, trying to buy a ball team
No I suit her, roosting, know we going all in

[Verse 9: Black Cobain]
Rolling up some killer, riding through my city
Bumping Bag of Money got a bag of money with me
She conceited, she know that, she was down with a nigga before rap
If I had the strap, she would hold that, she don't even smoke, but she’ll roll that
For me she drinking Henny she don't like it though
She fuck with real niggas cause that’s all she know
Make her pop that pussy hole, make her bring that money back
You niggas couldn't fuck my bitch if you gave her a hundred stacks
She all about a purse, not a bag, though, she work
When I’m in the pussy I surf, when she bless a nigga, like church
I’m on this bag of money remix
I’ll be all up in her Vickie’s but she cannot keep a secret

[Hook]

[Interlude & Hook][Bridge]
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!

[Hook x4]
Lamborghini Mercy, your chick she so thirsty
I’m in that two seat Lambo with your girl she tryna jerk me

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I’m rocking bally walking the valley of death
Vacheron cost a Lambo, you niggas in debt
I ain’t want to fuck your girl, I just wanted a fresh
After BIG, Puff told me I was the best
Still is that top nigga
Cocaine, Ciroc nigga
Pull up on that yacht nigga
Detectives know I’m hot nigga
Hostile, mob style, Rothchild's
Trench coat, half cal, my dick hang to my calf now
Real nigga, I woke up with a kilo
Real bitch, keep kissing on my pee hole
Paid in full, bitch I think I’m Rico
It’s Rozay, I sold food like Cee-Lo

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I’m in that Lamborghini drop top
Gunning for the top spot
Gold Rollie, my watch froze
You would think the clock stopped
Countin hella 20’s, get into my dreams
Ballin with my niggas
Your girl gon fuck the team
Now I been off that Jameson so I might need her name again
I came to win, she’s just tryna kick it like it’s 4th and 10
Give it as she gon run it back
Her legs spread like a jumping jack
Her other man, he hella whack
And he don’t stack it like Rockie stacks
Seen more clothes than a laundromat
More whips then Kunta back
Like racism, I’mma be around
So y'all niggas get used to that

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I’m fly to death
I step in death jam building like I’m the shit
Tell em give me 50 million and I’mma quit
Most rappers taste level ain’t at my waist level
Turn up the bass til it’s up in your face level
Don’t do no press but I get the most press key
Plus you’re my bitch, make your bitch look like precious
Talk about Mary, she gon off that Molly
Navajo party, it’s melted like Dali
Now everybody is moving their body
Don’t sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loadin just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas and Jordans

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I’m drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin’ champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut ya girl now your girl need a bandaid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin’, all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2][Intro: Casey Veggies]

That's how we rockin' mane, aye

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
My mind on the highway, my vision on tunnel
And good pussy I run through, you lettin' that run you
Man what have you come to? Why your living so untrue?
Niggas be lying, aye on my life, I swear these niggas be lyin'
We see that shit early, we go down your stories
I don't wanna know like I'm Mario Winans
And so I be grindin'
I'm sick and tired of seeing my momma providin'
She should be ridin' in a car
That's respected like she just come through with them sirens
Eat with the lions
And I'm startin to see a lot of you animals dyin'
On thin ice where the young boy glidin
Smoking on a plane, on my way to a island, stuntin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
She know that I got it
I know what you like and I know what you want
Just let me provide, like Ne-Yo
I know I'm the one, it's just inside me
When I first saw you at the party
I fell in love with your body
And then I just get in your mind
And see that you workin with all of this knowledge
I fuck with you girl, ain't tryna judge what you doing
We stuck in our world like Boy Meets Girl
You could be my young Topanga
My girl be happy for me and she love me
But I think she mad that I'm famous
Money and pussy make the world go round
Spit that straight game and your girl go down
Thug life tatted across my chest
Versace shades they on my eyes
Hundred bands, I don't own no wallets

[Hook][Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, funny how these boys front but they hustle backwards
They send Rockie on for a lot of factors
You can keep your lil' tweets cause they don't even matter
You got a bad bitch? Well, all my homies gettin' at her
Show no love, show no mercy
I ball on these niggas: old school, James Worthy
Praises to the most high, I'm so fly
And you know I rep the Chi 'till a nigga die
But I'm in every other state every other week
Climbin' Rocky Mountains, shorty takes a while to reach that peak
Yeah, it's double M, bitch, I fuck with Meek (Maybach Music)
These niggas waitin' on the album praying that it leak
I'm droppin' heat, I'm on fire, nigga you a lie
If you disagree, get some money, fuck with me
They said a young boy slept on
But what I spent on I probably went and put your rent on
I get gone

[Hook: G-Eazy]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah, that's what I've been on

[Bridge 1: Rockie Fresh & G-Eazy]
They wanna talk about the lights
They don't even know the price man
That's that shit I been on
(Yeah, that girl you got is nice, I already had her twice
That's that shit I been on)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, okay, that shit's what I've been doin'
I'mma do what I'm meant to and get money, this shit's been brewin'
If I'm doin' it in store beware the rise I'm ensuin'
Ah, look what the wind blew in, it's your girl who I've been screwin'
Yes, higher standards, higher class
That L.A. confidential will always keep a fire stash
Rappers want me on their songs? I make them wire cash
That's your housewife? She let me on-top-the-dryer smash
Life, don't smoke with us if you've got fragile lungs
Reminiscing being broke when I ain't have the funds
Breaking bread with the homies, now you snack on crumbs
Black on black, I'm looking like a ninja in these Shadow 1's
Yeah, I'm breaking swishers for the broccoli sesh
Coming to a city near you - it's me and Rockie Fresh
Might spend the rest of my life on tour
The Bay's what I put on for
This remix was an encore
They want more

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Tory Lanez & G-Eazy]
Niggas try and gash now first class through the clouds
Nigga that's that shit I been on
Yeah, and that's how it's going down: every night, another town
That's that shit I been on

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, look
And I remain that nigga, spittin' gettin' lifted off a swisher
Awkward, I just hit your bitch up off a picture off of Insta
It's the, uh, youngest on it, honestly I'm markin' targets off the list
And plan on kissin' Kate Barlow with ya bitch
Look, a nigga don't fuck with no hoes that don't give the dome
I'm gettin' dough, sick nigga I be spittin' foam
Gettin grown on my yard game, buy hard Balmain
Jeans cost half a trap-star plus a hallway
More Jordans, Fendi, Dior, sportin' your whore on my corridor
And I'm pourin' her four Porsches
Pull up for Porsches
Cops, they try and court us
These bitches let me in their slots like quarters
Old money in my spot like hoarders
Get shot like ballers on that court, bitch I'm hot like spoilers
See these niggas, you cannot control us
One umbrella stock hot like Glocks and sofas, nigga
Canada!

[Hook]

[Bridge 1][Hook]
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
A nigga say he get it like me, I doubt it
All about that money man, I can’t leave home without it
And we talking ‘cause we live it, yeah we really be about it
Say we about it, we really be about it
A nigga say he get it like me, I doubt it
All about that money man, I can’t leave home without it
And we talking ‘cause we live it, yeah we really be about it

[Verse One: Rockie Fresh]
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
I’m committed to commission, I collect it, then I count it
And a lot of niggas down it but it’s what the bitches down with
Looking for that next up out the Chi, think you found it
And you can keep on searching but won’t find no nigga realer
Just bought me a new Audi, pulled it fresh up out the dealer
Now your ho be trying to roll ‘cause I’m fly and smoke and kill her
Plus my chain be black and yellow, not from Pittsburgh but I Steeler
And I'm macking like Casilla, I got Cardo on the beat bitch
Got the fans waving, every show will make you sea sick
Blood season niggas salty ‘cause my pockets deep bitch
Hating on me, all seven days on some weak shit
We get whatever you want, know Rockie got ya
I’m the truth, these niggas lions just like Mufasa
Show stopper, so proper in that Baping shit
I got it early while you niggas on the waiting list

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
We love risk so it’s only right we respect hustlers
We will like hate haters and we check lovers
Cali trees enjoy in threes, give me my best hovers
Man, I’m walking on these niggas, they my step brothers
Chick cuff us, hoes love us ‘cause we give them space
Never get too comfortable ‘cause anyone can get replaced
She with me, she smoke for free, y’all do them expensive dates
Sexing while I’m flexing, think your swag might need to hit the weights
See this pimping from afar, you gon’ get your squint on
Pull up in that old school, bitch, I think I’m Vince Vaughn
After she got through with me, she had to get her limp on
Before me, it went wrong, I got off, now it’s on
I’m bent on smashing and dashing, ashing and passing
Bringing the cash in but that’s all after the rapping
Making it happen, if I shoot it, then you can count it
Money surrounded ‘cause this young nigga about it, yeah

[Hook][Verse 1]
I gotta make it to the other side, where the grass is much greener
What I don't have is swag, this is just my demeanor
And I swear that dirty money's the thing that's keeping me cleaner
That'll get me out the jam into a jam-packed arena
Everything that I dreamed of, rocking out at these packed shows
Leaving with so many girls that I gotta pack hoes
Entering through the back door, they know to keep they trap closed
I swear if y'all could just spend a day in these zappos
And stand on these plateaus, the view is so beautiful
To make it to the top you can’t usually be unusual
I’m way too out the box, I could never work in them cubicles
That school shit, I had did it, that N was fly at the funeral
Stunted on my opponents, hella people got on it
Now my buzz so big every indie nigga want it
The win is who I belong with, I’m just tryna get my placement
Not a doctor but I swallow the patients, ‘cause I know that y’all been waiting

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Man, it’s important to be absorbent when advice is given
An old head talking? I suggest you listen
But ask for recommendations, you’ll be the one they mention
I swear you niggas could get paid if you pay attention
Think I need an intervention, drunk off these punchlines
Serial killing tracks bitch, I’m the captain of crunch time
I’m tangled in my grind but that kush is helping me unwind
They broken, I’m the cast, so surprised that I’m unsigned
But my time will come, I will never stop believing
I will never stop my drive, from the day I put the keys in
Never rush or nothing, I’m just waiting on my season
Since I got up in this bitch, I swear I never plan on leavin’
And at this point I’m seeing, whatever we want we get it
I can’t wait ‘till a couple mill is just a parking ticket
On this road to riches, with thick fine bitches
Living young, fly, and gifted, we been dying to get it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We knew that I would blow, ‘cause I had a flow like a fountain
Now we on, yeah we on, led to the top of a mountain
And they see these niggas balling, but the checks is never bouncing
They just broke us off a week ago, and gurl is still counting
So the money’s not the issue, the issue is what it brings along
Star stunting on niggas that ain’t on what we was on, which is wrong
They ain’t jokes because they broke
And if I ain’t gone help them fix it, I ain’t got no right to diss it
My pops paid me a visit, he was helping me build the man
Now his son is in construction too because I built the brand
Took the time, took the grind, now I’m starting to take a stand
It’s been more than an ocean, but yeah we still see the plane
Here I am, tryna get whatever they have in store, the only exception is leaving with a pair or more
Yeah, that’s some food for thought on your plate, I’m just hoping that this mill was worth the wait[Intro]
Let's get all the money
Let's get it all
Right now
You gotta be a genie out here

[Hook: Casey Veggies]
Floating thru the streets like Aladdin
Got young freaks on my mattress
If that girl with me she the baddest
If he go against me he the saddest

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
All these girls fucking for the status
I see the game for what it is you see it backwards
I run thru that girl first you get her after
Imma real nigga, girl I ain't no rapper
Or really I'm tryna say I ain't like these rappers
Just know that shit you putting out it come back at ya
Got a small college chick, we put that dough together
If she eating veggies, she gon live forever
I'm floating thru the streets like Aladdin
I don't see nobody I think I need glasses
Different whips like them slave masters
Nigga try to hang me I'mma bash em, I'mma bash em

[Hook: Casey Veggies 2x]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Aight, these niggas look at me like "How it happen?"
He started free but now the nigga out here taxing
I bought another Jesus piece to show my passion
You think I'm popping now wait till I drop the Jasmine
So many stacks on me it got my pants saggin'
I do the Audi let my momma pull the Jag in
And truth be told I ain't really with the braggin'
I just remember so it's like I'm re-enacting
They yappin, they talking for reaction
I'm laughing, while I'm bringing all this cash in
Right now, higher then I ever been
A couple blunts and good head a nigga medicine
Twenty stacks, hundred racks, how I bring it back
Quarter-back throw a sack, now she in the sack
And we do dinner and a movie if she into that
And if you see us you will know and you remember that

[Hook][Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I pop up on yo' block, pull up on yo street
Girl, first I got your number, then I got under them sheets
Then I hopped on top of these beats, I ain't been home in weeks
Yeah, I know you tryna eat, but, nigga, I'm tryna feast, so I gotta go
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
Wasn't feelin' lil mama, had to fall back
Hit my phone, ain't talk no dope, I don't call back
Write these verses so, player, we read verses in Isaiah
Baby ain't even gotta state it, she know that I'm a smooth operator
Baby talk too much and I don't like that
Gotta leave tomorrow and I ain't book my flight yet
Sometimes, no matter what you do, they forget about all that
But I know they gon' remember me, cause a boy all that
I'm ballin', she want it, I get it, I get it
I'm plugged in, got friends that, spend millions

[Hook x2: Casey Veggies]
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
They don't think we from the streets, but I'm bout all that
I came up from the bottom, I do all that

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
All of these bitches be jockin', all of these niggas keep hatin'
I get Jacksons, Grants, and Franklins so we call that changin' faces
Stuntin' off in the Bugatti, drive so fast you think I'm racing
My nigga, this weed so strong, I'm gone, you might think I laced it
Ballin', bitch, I thought you knew
If you niggas had my paper, you'd be ballin' too
Teach a nigga how to stunt, I should start a school
All I do is press a button just to start the coupe
Swimmin' in so many women, I lost count
Once they give me that pussy, homie, I dog 'em out
If you ain't talkin' bout money then what you talkin' about?
If they say money talks, then my dollars shout
Popsicles on my chain, ice cubes on my wrist
Snow cones on my fingers, yo' bitch on my dick
Street nigga, still have a mill up in my shoe box
Old school, still keep a stash in my tube socks
Kush, all up in my rollin' papers
Got me coughin' like a cancer patient
Countin' cash like a calculator
OG still gettin' dome like activator, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I fuck bitches, I get money, I do all that
Niggas want me to impress 'em, they can fall back
I'd be trippin' if I told you I was all rap
I got stocks, I got blocks, nigga, hold that
Wal-Mart prices on the roll backs
Cheap shit, nigga, we don't know that
Expensive, designer, we spendin', we spendin'
I'm ballin', got friends that's, Egyptian
And I'm out for that payback
Got a couple niggas that stay strapped, yeah
New school had a nigga trippin'
But my old bitch helped me get my soul back, yeah
I started off in a Sonata, then I went and got me a Range
Then I went and got me a Beamer, now a few of my homies do the same
Nigga we don't care about chains, I can shine in white T
That's pro'ly why yo' bitch like me
Low key she wanna be my wifey, I'm thinkin' that she might be
Show her shit you never show her
She wanna get high I insert with a quarter
We playin' games, you out of order
Thirsty nigga need water, you know you can't afford her, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign]
She got blunts, I got papers, we got all that
We gon' smoke, we gon' fuck, we did all that
Homies trippin' and we trippin', we with all that
Pint of act, double cups, we got all that
Lil bruh fought his case, just gave him all day
Baby Buddha in there too, he got all day
Time goes by, puffin' on shake
Just to keep him high, watch the time waste
L.A. niggas in Atlanta strip clubs
Smoking good, eating good, I just fell in love
Lil bitch told the homie she don't have sex
We already fucked, you ain't gotta flex

[Hook]Is it really meant to be
Is she the one that's meant for me
Should I act on what I feel
Cause she's the closest thing to real I've seen
I wonder what she's waiting for
I wonder what were waiting for
I don't want to push the limit
Cause I hear that less is more
But I want to tap into you
Take our love to something new
Cause I'm sick of staying in this spot
So now, so now, so now

I wanna make a move
I really wanna go
If you want me to stay
Baby just let me know
I can only go as far as you let me[x2]
I wanna make a move
I really wanna go
If you want me to stay

As far as you let me[x4]

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Chi-Town nigga, stepping on the scene

I'm known to make them get money anthems for the team
But they still got a message like an answering machine
Shawty I'll fulfill your dreams, These other dudes sleep

And call me up at night, I be getting hella D
Vibrating like my phone if you ever wanna beat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Shit, control em' like 2k, or whatever you play
Hoes get scratched trynna diss her like blue-ray
All of that drama, I make her have to chill on it
Tell her if she act right, i'll throw a couple bills on her
Spend they whole deal on it, she should let me feel on it
Ass so live I could probably roll my kill on it
And I take her higher, say them other dudes sweet
Actin' like they money strong, but really out here 2 weeks
Sayin' that they buying, but really out here too cheap
Fakin' like they caught, Martin Lawrence on blue streak
And niggas trynna mimic how we stuntin'
And I smash her every morning guess I'm really up and coming

[Hook]x2[Intro: Rick Ross] + (T-Pain)
She self made too, therefore she winning
New Money, MMG, Self Made 2

[Interlude: Rick Ross & T-Pain] + (Wale)
She got me caught up in the moment (You got some nice pineapples, for real)
She got me caught up in the moment (Wale though, double M, remix)
I only kiss her when she on it
White Ferrari and she got her doin' donuts, hol' up

[Verse 1: Wale]
She like Wa-le my stroke game be on point
Yeah, shawty losing her mind her composure most of her voice
And she say she hate the word moist, but she can't escape from that vibe
You can play fight with that cat, me, I kill that pussy 9 times
I slow it down, let me slow it down
Ever since I hit that, look at it, that shit I got you poking now
Numbers we ain't throwing down, not me, no way, no how
Cause you know them screenshot broads always gonna run they mouth
Okay, I’m far too drunk I’m not driving (what’s up?), you know open bars are on fire
A little green and white in my pocket, so this song is now "Bag of Mara"
Caught up in the wrong timing, yeah, Jacob made my medallion
Just post up, but don’t coach much, but I love the stadium talent

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Bright lights picture, all right colors
I'll let you count my money, don’t think that you own me
You're my bag of my money, you're my bag of honey
I beez in your trap, while you're yelling fuck me
I be on some other shit
Maybach O up in this bitch
Tell you about them other niggas
They be lying about they figures

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
My bitch amazing; show stopper
Work at the titty club; pussy popper
Top drop white on white 645
I burnt her up from 5 o’clock until 6:45
Mr. 60 minutes, Mrs. Chanel, and Fendi
I hit her in the Porsche and burnt her up a new Infiniti
Presidential Rollie, JFK, she Mrs. Kennedy
Rose gold his or hers, diamonds and furs
Want a little suede, one on one bag
Look like a duffel bag of money, she beyond that
And I’m beyond swag, young thug nigga
Drug dealer; MMG affiliated blood nigga
That 50k on that vaca
20 bands on that birkin bag, 12 hunnid on that dinner date
We eat lobsters from Florida, French-ful flowers
Put you on the next level shit, world is ours

[Verse 4: Rockie Fresh]
Got my Sox cap, top back, shorty you could come outside
We can ride, drive an ’88, you know how we drive
You just want somebody that’s consistent and that will provide
I’m just trying to live in your division when your legs divide
I could take you high, you say your man don’t appreciate you
He should learn to be more grateful for somebody that’s been faithful
Instead he trying to play you, you know trying to Stevie J you
I just wanna make you rain like we in the month of April
And we hella young, let’s have some fun and never be on dummy
Got a good sense of humor, but you can’t be acting funny
You will get ate for dinner, but I’m hungry for some money
Every time I go and get it, then I’ll let you count it for me

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Trina]
I-I-I’m looking like a money money money badge
That’s why these niggas want me bad
Cause I’m so fucking special, diamonds and precious metals
Giuseppe stilettos, I’m the queen of the ghetto
Trina, I stay winning, I keep these niggas spinning
I’m looking for a boss, let me be your lieutenant
Let me be your masseuse, fine head in the coupe
Ménage in the suite, boy, you know I’m the truth
I stay stunning, looking like a bad of hundreds
You know your momma running, I keep that money coming
He bring that money home, he let me count it for him
Now I’m married to the mob and I’m riding for him

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Uh, my-my bitch mad cause I’d rather get that money
I give her this dick she say that dick better than money
I say, "Can I get some head?" She say, "Let me get my scrunchie"
Serve her like a country, got that dope dick she a junkie
She say "Tunechi, this your pussy", I say "Tell me anything"
Then I suck her nipple ring, eat that pussy; Listerine
She coming I make sure my bitch bad; she'll take yours
And she do tricks on that dick like a skateboard

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Uh, Maybach Riders, gold chain buyers
Gold wings saline your bitch say I’m the fliest
I make five thou gold ya’ll, spent that in about an hour
And my bitch like Bob May, ball hard 'til I get the callous
Shout out I ain’t got no stylist, shout out to you niggas keep trying
Bag of money, bag of money, I eat the money like I eat the pussy
King gold chains, they follow me, presidential car presidential suite
She bad and all, model type, but I like me a big booty
One time for them 9 to 5’s, one time for them stripper dimes
One time for them college girls, one time for those who can’t decide
I love her more I take them all, she doing bad I break her off
I’m T-Raw, don’t need ya’ll, everything I do is so well done

[Hook]

[Verse 8: French Montana]
I push the drop and let her ride shotty
My bitch bad looking like a bag of mollies
Hit the crib make a porno, my diamonds flash like photos
500 on my auto and I bought it out; fuck car note
Shorty know exactly who the realest is
Murder that (ahh) leave no witnesses
Started from the streets, turned to businesses
Dirty bag of money, stack it to where that ceiling is
Got, shorty, grab it, take it, to that, money
Shorty, dancing, for them, hundreds, got me, paying, on exonics
Bitch I’m balling all green, trying to buy a ball team
No I suit her, roosting, know we going all in

[Verse 9: Black Cobain]
Rolling up some killer, riding through my city
Bumping Bag of Money got a bag of money with me
She conceited, she know that, she was down with a nigga before rap
If I had the strap, she would hold that, she don't even smoke, but she’ll roll that
For me she drinking Henny she don't like it though
She fuck with real niggas cause that’s all she know
Make her pop that pussy hole, make her bring that money back
You niggas couldn't fuck my bitch if you gave her a hundred stacks
She all about a purse, not a bag, though, she work
When I’m in the pussy I surf, when she bless a nigga, like church
I’m on this bag of money remix
I’ll be all up in her Vickie’s but she cannot keep a secret

[Hook]

[Interlude & Hook][Intro]
In the barrel of a gun
With the girl girl girls
With the golden son

[Verse 1]
Swagger, the newest nigga, I’m winnin
This is just The Genesis, homie it’s the beginning
I’m travelling round the world and I’m getting pain with my crew
It’s a lot of people wondering why I do what I do
When I think about my mother who put your boy through summer school
When I was failing classes, waiting kiss these teachers’ ass
And I think about my pops who worked that 5 to 5
On the nights I should’ve died just to keep the dream alive
Now I’m standing here with 20 gold chains, I never run
Try to harm either
You gon have to meet the barrel of a gun

[Bridge]
You only got one shot
You only got one shot
You only got one shot
Don’t fuck it up, yea

[Hook]
When you get your shot, you better take it nigga
When you get your shot, you better take it nigga
‘Cause I will take mine and I will not miss
I’mma take mine, homey watch this

[Verse 2]
A lot of these rappers be out here wailin
Out here talkin all violent, I prefer to move silent
I know I’m on fire, but ain’t nobody flyer
These niggas say they hustle when they life is like the wire
Well my shit a little different, I’m living like Breaking Bad
I got them white boys cooking up in the lab
And we’ll see our pears, we only see the legends
I rarely talk guns, my ind is more a weapon
I’m murdering these rappers, going hard in every session
And my money got it coming, faster than a bullet from…

[Bridge] + [Hook][Rockie Fresh]
I got ‘em yelling aw shit, Rockie got another tape
Time in another zone, mind in another state
These niggas hella hate, I’m just trying to elevate
Fresher than some 409’s, rep that 708
Chi-Town nigga who whip until my clique is full
These niggas analytical, they need to be original
Problem is everybody focused on the next man
When they should be focused on them checks man
Yeah but I ain’t tripping ‘cause I’m always on my hustle
That’s gon’ me keep in the bank and always keep me out of trouble
That’s gon’ make my money double and triple off the tour soon
Balling like I’m on the court while staying out the courtroom
You’ll never hear the guy will drop, people never have me locked
But I stand behind my bars while we drive them foreign cars
And we specialize in doing the unthinkable
Salute to all my brothers in the Treated Crew, Rockie[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, funny how these boys front but they hustle backwards
They send Rockie on for a lot of factors
You can keep your lil' tweets cause they don't even matter
You got a bad bitch? Well, all my homies gettin' at her
Show no love, show no mercy
I ball on these niggas: old school, James Worthy
Praises to the most high, I'm so fly
And you know I rep the Chi 'till a nigga die
But I'm in every other state every other week
Climbin' Rocky Mountains, shorty takes a while to reach that peak
Yeah, it's double M, bitch, I fuck with Meek (Maybach Music)
These niggas waitin' on the album praying that it leak
I'm droppin' heat, I'm on fire, nigga you a lie
If you disagree, get some money, fuck with me
They said a young boy slept on
But what I spent on I probably went and put your rent on
I get gone

[Hook: G-Eazy]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on
Yeah, that's what I've been on

[Bridge 1: Rockie Fresh & G-Eazy]
They wanna talk about the lights
They don't even know the price man
That's that shit I been on
(Yeah, that girl you got is nice, I already had her twice
That's that shit I been on)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, okay, that shit's what I've been doin'
I'mma do what I'm meant to and get money, this shit's been brewin'
If I'm doin' it in store beware the rise I'm ensuin'
Ah, look what the wind blew in, it's your girl who I've been screwin'
Yes, higher standards, higher class
That L.A. confidential will always keep a fire stash
Rappers want me on their songs? I make them wire cash
That's your housewife? She let me on-top-the-dryer smash
Life, don't smoke with us if you've got fragile lungs
Reminiscing being broke when I ain't have the funds
Breaking bread with the homies, now you snack on crumbs
Black on black, I'm looking like a ninja in these Shadow 1's
Yeah, I'm breaking swishers for the broccoli sesh
Coming to a city near you - it's me and Rockie Fresh
Might spend the rest of my life on tour
The Bay's what I put on for
This remix was an encore
They want more

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Tory Lanez & G-Eazy]
Niggas try and gash now first class through the clouds
Nigga that's that shit I been on
Yeah, and that's how it's going down: every night, another town
That's that shit I been on

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, look
And I remain that nigga, spittin' gettin' lifted off a swisher
Awkward, I just hit your bitch up off a picture off of Insta
It's the, uh, youngest on it, honestly I'm markin' targets off the list
And plan on kissin' Kate Barlow with ya bitch
Look, a nigga don't fuck with no hoes that don't give the dome
I'm gettin' dough, sick nigga I be spittin' foam
Gettin grown on my yard game, buy hard Balmain
Jeans cost half a trap-star plus a hallway
More Jordans, Fendi, Dior, sportin' your whore on my corridor
And I'm pourin' her four Porsches
Pull up for Porsches
Cops, they try and court us
These bitches let me in their slots like quarters
Old money in my spot like hoarders
Get shot like ballers on that court, bitch I'm hot like spoilers
See these niggas, you cannot control us
One umbrella stock hot like Glocks and sofas, nigga
Canada!

[Hook]

[Bridge 1][Produced by Tone P]

[Intro: Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I groom better
Like I'm under a goal post, I am too official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick, haha
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though, try to hit the Jummah
Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said "you winning, why BOA pray so much?"
I say "you tripping, such winnin make niggas prey on us"
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

[Interlude: Wale]
Folarin in this motherfucker

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, aw, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas, I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don’t be a statistic
Have yo main bitch sending me pictures
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah, nigga I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If you're a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole World, zip your coat up tight, I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young C.O.L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, oh, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot, Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a helluva start

Cole... World... nigga
Double M-G, Dreamville shit

[Hook: Wale][Hook x2]
I say that Audi be clean when I'm driving
If she got ass then I'mma high five it
Put them legs on top of yo body
I got them phones them phones I can't hide it

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
It's Rocks ho - Picasso
My Wardrobe looking like I cop dope
And my main girl throat it and do not choke
That Mazi throw the forks up but I'm not folks
Young nigga with funds, treat the hundreds like ones
Man I'm whipping whips and I grip the grain, wood grain on that pistol grip
Critics say that they hate the god, on vacation I take the squad
Man I needed that trip so my mind I can take it off
For all of this bullshit I deal with on the daily
Them hoes tryna be hoes, niggas tryna be shady
I wanna buy a boat and smoke a pack with my homies
Eat a couple lobsters, smack a couple phonies
Cause when we kick it it's a celebration
It's hella bitches thick several places
We smoking swishers like it's medication
I stay with Franklin but it's no relation

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Said it's a party in this bitch, the drinks stay on refill
Niggas had the game fucked up, watch us rebuild
Brick by brick, the view so sick
I'm staring out a window with this thick ass chick
Who got her legs parted like a space between cornrows
I be on the road getting cheese and more dough
You at home with it your delivery digiorno
If we ain't winning you're slow, when you see us you'll know
Everything is insane, chain to the whip game
Yo bitch about to fall victim to the pimp game
On the boat she selling, she on the hunt like Helen
I know what women want but to these niggas I ain't telling
And I ain't about that drama every time we gon' deflect
I be high stepping, got Balenciaga's on they neck
Bigger grind so I always went and got the bigger check
They ain't gotta like a nigga but I'm gon' get my respect

[Hook x2][Hook 1: Casey Veggies]
Celebrating life, we sip champagne
We don’t talk about it, we do the damn thing
She be rockin with it, she with the campaign
She don’t talk about it, she do the damn thing

[Hook 2: Rockie Fresh]
Celebrating life, we sip champagne
We don’t talk about it, we do the damn thing
She say she rockin with it, she with the campaign
Girl don’t talk about it, show me what you sayin

[Casey Veggies]
From out of town, I’m coming home, I’m get straight to the paper
Last night was in the studio next to Anita Baker
We came far, them memories faded, I’m seein hella faces
She pledging for it, this peas and carrots, alpha omega
Baby girl, she drop it low for these bands and shake it
I’m getting money, I’m dodging haters, they mad I’m tryna make it
This PNC the squad yeah, roll with us or get rolled on
Where I come from they get it done, all we know is it go hard
West side, my top down, I’m going to the store y'all
Niggas try to get in my way, we gon have to bogart
It’s a celebration of real niggas being them self
Said you’re good yourself but y'all do this shit well
Do it to the death, I don't do it for my health
I’ll be…

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]

[Rockie Fresh]
Damn, a nigga faded forever
Look at the squad, see all my niggas made it together
I’m going hard cause you know being broke is a never
I’m touching work and right now I ain’t got time to text you
My Rollie over the horn as I pull up at the light
And tonight I done bought a couple bitches a flight
See yall know where’s the money homie, fuck that end of em tight
And I live every fuckin day like it’s the end of my life
See I might holler at a bitch, see what her energy like
Some hoes be frontin and they be on you, remember me right
No no ho ho I’m so forgetful, I don’t remember faces
Unless they green faces, young Rockie getting paper yeah

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2][Hook: Hit-Boy]
Who the nigga gettin' all that dough?
That my whole circle
Take ya bitch, She won't call back home
That my whole circle
Hit the party, We blow that loud
That my whole circle
Them my nigga my bro my round
That's my whole circle

[Bridge: Casey Veggies]
Ain't no squares in my circle(x9)

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I'm a young fly LA nigga
And ain't no squares in my circle
She down to ride, She let me film
Might put her ass in a commercial
And rep the team, that's a good look
Got the recipe in the cookbook
She naked, taking pictures for the look book
And the boy bout to hit like a good hook, She going
Baby girl always see me out when we be tourin'
Only 19 but i'm pulling up in that Foreign
Square niggas tryna' block
She taking shots and I'm scoring
They pay a lot, So I blow it
She shake a lot, So I throw it

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Put this shit on Shaq bitch
We ain't backing down
My business pitch can get my Cy Young

London and Amsterdam
I am world-renowned
Money coming to me, Money coming to me

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Watch me cost a buck, chain cost me a truck
Double M be the clique my coupe more than your bus
Think it’s all facade, but nigga just double R
See me jumpin on stage, more chains than Mardi Gras
Bitches been going wild hate to sound cliche
Give me two bitches we could do this three ways
Four miss calls on my iPhone five
Bitch six feet tall got me fighting for my life
Telephone lines ringing, calling Angie Martinez

All gold jewels in this snow white mink

Every time you see me I’ll be on the front row

New Cuban link with the all gold piece
Benz outside I ain’t even gotta speak, uh

[Hook: Big Sean]
As I look around and I do it like my clique (Maybach Music)
You know this bad bitches they want the, they want the, they want

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Yeah I'm talking gunplay, yeah I walk it too

Point him out, I light a joint and take his face and out it
Yeah I spill my Corse on your Michael Kors, whore
Yeah so the fuck what? I could buy you more
Yeah in front of hood, yeah I’m from the floor
Hoes in the roof, hardly had a door
Kitchen on door, pitchin on purp

Nigga where your feast? See the white right here
It’s a Medellín thing; everything pure
Man the clique

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah yeah yeah
Now it's the double M dream team doing something special
Bout to kill the shit so get the casket and the shovel
And new Olympic sevens I need rings and the medal
When I’m not from Trillville but I tell 'em get up on my level
I’m always going higher, I’m still mo' fire
Do a lot of stuntin' but it’s only too inspire
Remember just a year ago these hoes ain't wanna speak
Now they all be tryin to freak, they think I know Wale and Meek
I got a bad white bitch I know they spend cake on
Just hope that she never fall off like Kreayshawn
Even if she do forever I’m shit
So much dope I’ma get we legit
I ain’t fucking with my clique

[Hook]

Maybach Music[Verse 1]
Music loud, driving fast, life is just to good to crash
Speeding racing from the past, took some moments made them last
Hustle just like Money Mitch, now I've found my niche
Authentic hustle, everything I ever did's legit
Fake shit in my rear-view, finally got a clear view
Like when you don't fall into the goopy things that peers do
We mashing, and we refuse to slow down
Push it to the limit while I'm repping for my hometown

[Hook x2]
You see me rolling through the city man
I got my pedal on the ground
And I'll be higher than the highest plane
I got no plans of coming down (Anytime I come around)

[Verse 2]
Crush the competition, sticking to the mission
Paper in my vision, I just took what I was given
All I know is progress, speeding up my process
And I doubt that there will ever be a day I am not fresh
Cause cleanliness is next to godliness
And this is his work, so it ain't no way I'll be stopping this
I'm popping, bitch, and I hope you're enjoying watching this
Speeding racing, make 'em have to call the cops for this

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
I'm so high, I ain't never coming down[Verse One: Action Bronson]
(This that beautiful shit)
She got the bathwater running, honey smelling like some almond milk
Lavender and cocoa nib, hop on a pogo stick
Don’t mind her, she’s only here for taking photos, shit
Unless you wanted to jump in all on the low, low
I love your pussy lips, the fatness and the shape of ‘em
And plus they got a little shake to them, many times forsaken ‘em
Improper use had led you to the doctor many times
In the past year, keep the flask near
Drink away the sorrows, reaching for tomorrow
Dip out of the country with this time that I have borrowed
Never to return again but you could write me with the feather
To my number one fan, I love you Heather

[Hook: Macie Stewart]
You’ve got me feeling so fine
And I can hardly find the time, yeah
Tomorrow’s so far down the line
So sit yourself down and unwind

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
This year, I took a hundred flights
Which mean my girl cried a hundred nights
Hundred groupie hoes I gave the pipe
But I still found time to get my paper right
Big money on it, tell ‘em go and count the pile
Man I swear to God this life is wild
You be creative and they take your style
Lot of bitches out here lame, they just in denial
We keep it cool but she hot as hell, we make it melt
She got me living with a feeling that I never felt
And every day we smoke the dopest dope that has been dealt
I had to leave because I’m getting booked just like a show
She told me I’m a learn that some people ain’t worth the help
And you show them the ropes, they go and hang they self
And I gotta listen to anything that Heather say
I gotta stay shining, don’t wanna see Heather gray
Aye

[Hook: Macie Stewart]
You’ve got me feeling so fine
And I can hardly find the time, yeah
Tomorrow’s so far down the line
So sit yourself down and unwind[Hook 1]
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

[Verse 1]
From the bottom to the top floor, and I'm trying to make it further
See I just met with money and I'm happy with that merger
Doing shit you never heard of, taking my city to a different place
Few niggas did this shit before but it's about that time change of face
I'm going up with my eyes low wack cuz I've been smoking
Told them I would do it, but they thought that I was joking
Now I'm on

[Bridge]
And I ain't listening to what you say
Nigga, you a hater, don't even talk to me

[Verse 2]
This road that I have chosen, I'm happy so I'm speeding down it
I know how to handle that money simply cause I be around it
And a nigga is so fucking fly, but somehow I'm still grounded
Bitches coming to my crib, and a young nigga pound it
Yea I do that, flow so motherfucking stupid
Put an arrow in your heart like cupid
Off of this young fly here music, and I'm moving up

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Ain't even got a motherfucking tracklist
But you're saying I'm the best at this rap shit
Take the beat of the motherfucking captive
Then I take the money and make the shit back-flip
Yeah, I lost my mind but found some hoes
Was it the game or designer clothes?
You ain't worth a nickel, son, don't jack my flows
Don't be mad at me cause I got chose
Took my situation, made it the best
All of that whack shit, I laid it to rest
New 3's, Bape tees, God damn a nigga fresh
And my money coming up but the tops are depressed
It's down

[Bridge]

[Hook 2]
Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one[Hook: Rebecca Jordan]
Why do we make it, so complicated
And question 'til we're sorry
Every day happy belated
Don't worry, don't worry

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Okay I'm rolling while I'm sipping, I ain't ever tripping
Chi-Town living, bad bitch getting
Trying to prove I'm different, than the ones that ain't shit
They at the plate, they swing late and they can't hit
Me I'm bringing three home, that feel like a grand slam
And I can still probably pull 'em in a Grand Am
Cookies and some apple juice, I feel like that man can
Change gon' come when I cook, like that man Sam
Clearing all that damn scam, making sure my people eat
One time for the birds, one time for the street
I'mma show you love, and that's any time that we should meet
Never on that beef shit, cause that shit be hella weak
First they hating than they speak, no they not about it
People dying over drama, I'm just trying to live without it
Like the homie Future say, it really ain't no way around it
When you on the up and up, there's always people trying to doubt it
First they love it then they hate it man

[Hook: Rebecca Jordan]

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Okay I'm rolling while I'm sipping, I ain't ever tripping
Chi-Town living, bad bitch getting
Can't trust new niggas, we ain't never flipping
Sticking with the ones that I was with since the beginning
And y'all ain't gotta worry about me
I'll be chilling low-pro while I'm twisting OG
?? yeah my flow below three
If I want it I'mma earn it, I know nothing comes free
Fresh clothes on me, the young homie styling
Caesar with the dressing, but the leathers come Italian
We ain't even tripping, spending thousands on the island
It ain't really nothing look at all that we've been piling
Faith in the situation, ?? know I've been waiting patiently
While I'm falling in love with the places life is taking me
Trying to make sure I can handle every issue
If I'm witchu then I'm witchu, I'm I'm not then it's forget you
I'm just trying to make it simple but

[Hook: Rebecca Jordan][Verse 1]
Man i’m that same dude that works hard
While you’re place running like base god
But all my rhymes good homie, all my rhymes good
Digits never lying, but you know a Tiger Would
I’m, hitting birdies, scope them out, so many fans can’t keep a count i
Lock the key, to my safe, cause all them girls want a peace of me
Peace & Great thats how i live, them other rappers can’t amount to shit
Shh, keep it down, lot of fake friends i don’t keep around
Like my women square, never get around
