[Hook]

Talking 'bout mi casa, scared to death when I pop up

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Started with a hooptie and I went and got a Beamer
Pull up in a boat, titanic La Marina
Shout out to young gunner, spend a hundred on my timer
Looking through the smoke and mirrors, smoking marijuana
Rarri and the Gatti and the Beamers and the Benzes
Homicide china, yeah my door off the hinges
Riding with some cubans that be fresh up out that border
Making back a whole thang, breaking down a quarter
Drophead, getting dome, riding through New Orleans
Hear them shots ringing then I hit that money caller
Counting up my blessings, counting money keep a dollar
Drophead white mink on when it's cold Out

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: N.O.R.E.]
Coke Boys get the coke money, plenty cash
Live niggas just smoke ash, Phantom seat stashed

My nigga if you ain't coppin' you ain't got no business around the fucking spot

[Verse 1 - Chinx]
No degrees but did my thing in culinary
Either that or could've hit them courts and hoop
Creep up on them with them hammers we gon' nail em
Keep my pistols smoking like some Campbell soup
D.A. tryna lock me up for child abuse cause I was whippin' babies
In the daycare, and pushed em off the stoop
Chopper with the scope, tell them niggas merry Christmas
But it won’t be Santa Claus niggas sending through your roof
Catch a nigga hanging round the trap, he need to buy something
I’mma do the chicken dance with Flocka when them pies come
Pull up to the dock and park the fee up on the boat
Pussy nigga, guarantee less than a key will get you smoked
When that money come in, you and some your niggas fall out
Hate it when you pull up to the venue with them cars out
All my diamonds blue, [?] jeweler got me on some LOC shit
And them killers with me down to shoot, ain’t with no ho shit

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
Yeah, fuck up out my dope house, where them niggas came from
Montega Jada, where you think I got the name from
Raised round the junkies, where you think I got my game from
Soon as the love stop, that’s when the pain come
We ain’t selling bundles either, we just moving big shit
Try to disappear with some work, get your wig split
You can try to find a vein or you can sniff shit
Get it on the arm then I need a little interest
Naw you can’t live with us, we don’t want no visitors
People call us drug dealers, I say we distributors
Haters gone hate cause we keep making em sick of us
Keep making it hot, they gone think about evicting us

[Hook]

They be talkin' bout my bitch, yea that’s a different story
Nigga talkin' bout the trivia, that’s a another story
And shawty gettin' high, you know we sittin' way up
Average nigga ain’t gon' get it, gotta get his weight up
Niggas shinin' like a diamond, all them niggas flawless
And if yo chick got a line then tell that chick to fall in

[Bridge - Chinx]
Get that money, motherfuck a hater
Tell your nigga bye, you’ll see him later
Pull that bullshit then we pull a raven
Shawty leavin' with me ain’t no ultimatum

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Chinx]
All we do is count this money, get to the bank
I be slidin' on them lames like a set of skates
Never pay attention to 'em, I just let 'em hate
Me and shawty be burning weed up by the fireplace
They be tryna find out any reason just to fade us
Make it look like we ain't never stressin' and we paid up
I ain't never trip but you the only one that's flawless
Got the thing wetter than the floods up in New Orleans

[Bridge 2]
Tell the truth, doin' it like we stressin'
We be stylin' on 'em, super flexin'
Never mind the price, no need to check it
You know you my baby, ain't no second guessin'

Or what kind of shit he been through (yay)
Watch niggas ball, shit I couldn’t score

Now a nigga fly by (by), fly jumping out the drive right (right)
Haters see me when I hop out (what?)
When a nigga did his state bid
Was the only time I copped out (copped out, yay)
(I’m askin' God questions, what we fighting for?)
(A nigga lost his name, what you crying for?)
Rock bottom, not going up
Fuck slowing up, I’m drinking (yay)

Know some niggas at the bottom and they still in it
Ask yourself, nigga really?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I’ve been dangerous
Rolled up blazed with the angel dust
Murder one homicide when they came to us
We came with the bail when they came with cuffs
Fame and trust – it don’t mix, like oil in the water
Feds on my door while I’m boiling the water
Need those chips, Michael in the fourth quarter
When you getting money fast life’s getting shorter
Nigga hit yo' head then nigga go and mop 'em
Nigga play Batman nigga gon rob 'em
Looking at my rap shit, nigga won’t argue
Niggas talk a rap beef, nigga no problem
Coming from my head, just my God on me
Pussy and the bread, keep 'em calling me
Money in the bag, nigga calling me
But you pussy ass crackas don’t follow me
Now I’m talkin bout 500 dirty on my day like
Them young niggas hit you on the daylight
Young nigga tote that nina
Niggas turn on you, they ain't playin' right
Hundred thousand with a cross in the middle
Playing both sides with a cross in the middle
R.I.P. with a cross in the middle
HAAAH! (Ask yourself nigga, really)

Since I got the rock I been hard in the paint

Post on the block and them pistols is loaded
Ducking them cops, shaking them rodents
We started from that floor up
You talking money then show some
When I rose up, my dough’s up like yay
When it’s war time then them niggas gon miss you
Been a long time, now the money ain’t an issue
Court side seat, nigga brought his own whistle
Pushing that rock, running the floor
Killing em, that was my aim from the door
Most of my niggas they ducking parole
We keep it quiet, you making it show
These niggas wired, I don’t want to talk
Them niggas lying, they ain’t got no dope
They be complying, they side with the law
Stand with iron, I ride with the four

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
My niggas gon' break that, head tops
Everybody catching headshots when we bend blocks
Fuck around and get your friend popped when we send shots
Do you really want to test hot, I’m a ten top
Imma hit you with a chest shot till your vest pop
Hit you with the best Glock in your tank top
Shots falling like a rain drop in the same spot
Everybody want to bang hot till the gang hot

Hop out, the youngin' blow his top out
We drop out when my nigga pull that Glock out
When the Tommy get [?], can't top out
Drop a dime on my nigga, I’ll block out
Put them bands on your head and your man’s gonna be dead
Cause none of my niggas can’t top out
I roll with them niggas that ride for me
Shoot at a nigga and die for me
Homie take over your property
And all of my niggas so proud of me
And all of my niggas still different, there’s levels to shit
And I know that I’m shitting
Plus there’s money they're getting
You fuck with their money, they load up that Smith and (Blaow!)

Head shot paramedics come and get ya
Gone after pills and a couple of liquor
Still on the block wid a couple niggas
Dread by the bank, nigga we ain't got it
Flights ain't the same, nigga different pilots
Whole lot of change, nigga different wallets
IG laughing at them niggas comments
Teach 'em how to shoot, nigga, triggernomics
Shawty need a ride, I'mma give her molly
If dick is her mind, she gon' get the knowledge
Smokin' lot of loud, but you niggas silent
I think I'm Diddy, I run my whole city, I front on these niggas
Pull out the Phantom, the Rarri, the Lotus
The Aston, Bugatti, then stunt on these niggas
Fuck all these niggas

You niggas on it, whippin' they yay to the moment
Bitches they on me, wasn't gon make it

I Ride wit that 40, this life it cost and I can't afford it
Told y'all we ballin', don't fuck wit them lines
Y'all know they recordin', Roll up with the top down
Pull up and we shut the whole block down
If ain't about a dollar nigga not now
Everything designer from the top down
Coke Boy fresh nigga, rocked out
If you could get cheaper nigga shop 'round
9 millimeter with the Glock rounds
Do it for my niggas still in lock down (Boy)
Talkin' bout the money in a whip game
Nother hundid fifty on the wrist game
Scoop a nigga hard on a late night
She will open wide like a Great White
With them bird flue was a safe line
Pussy niggas know they gonna take flight
When you gettin money, niggas wanna know
What the combination to yo safe locks

[Hook: Chinx Drugz][Intro]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong, but my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true

[Hook]
Promise always keep 100 strapped with 100 clips
Started from 100 dollars, tryna make 100 Ms
Lost 100 niggas, bought about 100 whips
Made about 100 visits, sent about 100 flicks
100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100 100

[Verse 1: Cheeze]
Your new mixtape, sour we break up on
Put that mac in his face, no make up on
Home invasions, your mouth we puttin tape upon
Blades through your forehead, no shape up on
Yeah, it's Cheeze, I'm the one that get my cakin' on
In the kitchen, pie flippin' with my apron on
I gotta have patience, but they taking long
They ain't got no cool, nigga breakin' on
100 bottles, 100 bitches
2 O's, 100 Swishers
Million dollar dream, blue dream wishes
Ice shining, tryna scheme with your misses

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Took took took the game by surprise, they ain't see us coming
See they tracks in the sand, got these suckers running
Fresh off this life from poverty, board that money train
Put 100 on your head, you can keep the change
I lost 100 niggas, gained zero friends
I'm six zeroes in, feel like I never came to win
Some call it ungrateful, I call it overdue
Double styrofoam cup with that purple juice
Leanin', big money schemin'
Dump tell stack I said what up, fuck 'em, I ain't lettin' up
Got the game by the testicals, gun range tested
SKs and the 50 Cals, quiet but my jewerly loud
My money went from Spud Webb to Manute Bol
I'm ballin' hot, these niggas luke cold
They don't want the money, that's why they run from it
If you a stand up nigga, then keep it 100

[Hook]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
My niggas put in work, shawty held me down
Hustlin paid the bills, karma came around
That fast money came, nigga, then I lost touch
When it sounds too good, nigga, I never trust it
From crabs in the bucket to them lobster tails
From the block to trynna get Madonna sales
They got keys from west, to hittin Key West
Thats a motherfucker, Delonte West
Gettin high off moll nigga, fuck niggas lame
Thats a hundred thou, trynna fix the pain
Niggas stole our style, trynna switch the game
Hoppin' out the shower, throw on a hundred chainYeah!!!
Right!!!
It's all I know

(Hook)
Talking bout the money, talking bout the money
Talking bout the hoes, talking bout the hoes
Talking bout the cars (the cars)
That street shit is all I know, it's all I know
It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, its all I know
Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0
It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, its all I know
Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0

(Verse 1)
Drew the perfect portrait now I'm hanging up the picture
Bought myself a fortress isolated from them niggas
Drinking out the faucet thats equated with the riches
Curve ya niggas but do anything for the bitches
Came from the bottom sewer
Ballin like Dumars back when he played for the piston
Hit the gun range practice aiming at a witness
Song singing need em at arraignment with the biscuit
Coke boy ex dope boy
If you ya brothers keeper nigga watch him die doughboy
Boyz in the hood still drinking juice
Thots in the hood still getting loose

(Hook)

(Verse 2)

Everything that happened in these streets god planned em
You know I'm close cuz you can feel the heat start fanning
Snatch the soul out your punk ass make you touch grass
Put a hole in em big enough you can park a van in
Came up swapped the sardines for the salmon
See it's funny how real brick layers turn to scammers
Still watching cameras trafficking the balance
Air your dirty laundry keep your eyes on your hammer

(Hook)[Hook:]

Niggas wanna see me fall, but I ain't trippin'
I ain't trippin', grain grippin', stay drippin'
I be dealin'. Fuck 'em all, but I ain't trippin'
Ride dippin', got your main piece all up on my line trippin'
All we do is smoke, all you do is talk
Fresh up out the kitchen, got it smellin' a vault
Got 'em yellin' like yeah, all this money over here..
Coke boys we on it

[Verse 1: Lil' Durk]

OTF and Coke Boys. Y'all niggas don't make no noise

They ain't ringin', I'm cashin' out
A lot of hoes, I could pass em out
Rose with Ace of Spade. Hundred dollar bottles, I could pass 'em out
Your bitch give me that Facetime. Ferragamo my waist line
Pop-pop bitch, I can't waste time. Rollie on my wrist I spare time
I get mine, I get mine. Fuck a hater nigga, I get mine
I get mine, I get mine. Fuck a hatin' bitch, I get mine
Fresh-fresh out the kitchen, these-these niggas bitches

Thang sittin' on them Ashanti's, 30 racks on my time piece
Don't act like you don't see that pistol sittin' right side me
More drank, more bitches. More drank, more bitches
Hoppin' out on 'em. Ho please no pictures

Fresh off the block to this rap

Most of my niggas they ducking parole
We keep it quiet, you making it show
These niggas wired, I don’t want to talk
Them niggas lying, they ain’t got no dope
They be complying, they side with the law
Stand with iron, I ride with the four

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bobby Shmurda]
My niggas gon' break that, head tops
Everybody catching headshots when we bend blocks
Fuck around and get your friend popped when we send shots
Do you really want to test hot, I’m a ten top
Imma hit you with a chest shot till your vest pop
Hit you with the best Glock in your tank top
Shots falling like a rain drop in the same spot
Everybody want to bang hot till the gang hot
Bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
None of my niggas ain’t scared to catch no bodies
Monte with me got about four bodies
Mitch is with me got about six bodies
Jaba with me got about two bodies
Me I got about 12 or ten bodies
Or ten bodies
Bodies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rowdy Rebel]
(Bow) Pull a car in that pussy then pop out
Hop out, the youngin' blow his top out
We drop out when my nigga pull that Glock out
When the Tommy get [?], can't top out
Drop a dime on my nigga, I’ll block out
Put them bands on your head and your man’s gonna be dead
Cause none of my niggas can’t top out
I roll with them niggas that ride for me
Shoot at a nigga and die for me
Homie take over your property
And all of my niggas so proud of me
And all of my niggas still different, there’s levels to shit
And I know that I’m shitting
Plus there’s money they're getting
You fuck with their money, they load up that Smith and (Blaow!)

Stackhouse up in that trap house
Ten toes down, my strap out
Back against the wall, nigga lash out
Nigga can’t think with his cap out
Them birds on, got hang time
My young boys throw gang signs
Don’t fuck with no new niggas
Get crossed like them state lines
Maserati swerving, out the lobby serving
Wash that money like detergent
Snatch that rex and drop the work in

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Dreamt about all of this money
Nigga done woke up and got it
Rinsing off all of these hundreds
Nigga came fresh out the projects

Done found out they eat cheese so it’s glue all in my mousetraps
Got this shit, man this shit laid out
We eat and run like it’s takeout
Only way you gone come up if we stay down

Dunking on these hoes, jumping from that dotted line
Move work up on the stove, end of every night, I counted mine

They know I’m still the greatest

I got a bitch and my mistress is still in patience
And she missing the sick dick and she sick of waiting
But i got sick of waiting
I got a zip of piff that I've been puffin lately
I feel like shit is gravey only if i make it out
And if this road lead to a dead end I'mma make a route
I got 'em all down south
They go from making money out of town
To get my own down south
Disrespect in here will get you punched in the lip
We got bricks not the back boy the front of the rim
So a lot of pricks bitches often coming with me
Spread money across the counter never question receipts
I ain’t mean to approach ya
I got my team to scope ya
They took a shop to tangle all to keep my focus
We burning..

[Hook: AKON]

Some niggas turn to haters
Some haters to fans
My idols turn to neighbors
Corner turn to stages
My life turn to pages

I’m talking Coke Boy money, it’s money you’ve never seen
Nigga the drug money, we get it by any means
I turned one brick to a three, we flip with the 16
Taking headshots, 187 the same

[Verse1:Chinx]
Oh shit, jughead just bought a 5, g-head
A king tut piece, bout the size of Little Maurice
Fore I step out the crib put the 40 on me
When you greet a nigga do it how you would an OG
Shots rained, bum dropped his 40 ounce OE

[Verse2:FrenchMontana]
Drop back, young boys lift you off your feet
We be ripping tours, drug dealers, that hit the Forbes
White wraith, white house nigga, world is yours
I got a thang with china silk, diamond rings
3 quarter mink, [?] on the link
Four five six bitch walking with the bank
Montana, rent paid [?]
Peep the driveway, you gone need a gas stop
They tried to finish me, came up in this industry
Catch me in that drop head, shawty getting dentistry
Hoes pimps and [?], nigga play the burner

Talk fly, nigga clip your wings
Put your bitch in the crossfades, chicken wings
We flip birds like we’re flying trapeze
Niggas on parole, frying that leaf

Niggas flying that east
Where you gone have to die for that piece
Bout 1.5 on them cars at least

Hopped out, got the new car smell
Coach him how to touchdown with the work
Nigga Bill Parcells
Snatch your chain, niggas buy it back
Watch for the wire tap
All the loose ends, we be tying that

[Verse6:FrenchMontana]
Buying that, 36 Os, 36 strategies of war
Stash houses, hackey sack then [?] wall
We ain’t see the law, Stevie Wonder how
One nation under god, never let the drama slide
Screaming Buh!

[Hook]Intro]
Closing up shop, and locking doors
Runnin up lost in someone's room
Silence so lighty you go dim
Bombs are going off inside your chest
If it feels like the end

[Bridge]
Coke boy, Montana, we up in here
What they talkin' about?
I'm Coke Boy, Montana, we up in here

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Custom made shoes but I dont trust a soul
They try and nail me to the cross but I'm across the globe
I'm talkin' twenty M's, or twenty in the pen
Winners never quite, quiters never win
Coming out the bottle, you don't know the half
I'm famous know my signature call the autograph
From the most hated, to the most loved
See these red diamonds, nigga thats cold blood
Hugs turn to waste, killers turn to dates
Niggas hate to love, haters love to hate
Osalamalekam, Inshallah
Please tell my story right (if I gotta die)

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
See them diamonds flashin' come and catch the photo
High off life but I'm sittin' solo
Bitches fall out, real niggas fall in
Sharks in them waters dare you stick your toes in
Tryin' find God cause they gave me Hell
Road paved in them hundreds, that's a paper trail
Chinchilla damu, but the coupe loccin'
Absorbed all this bullshit let the truth soak in
Self made never punched a clock
Before I hug a pig, I'mma hug the block
From the blocks where the young niggas hit they vein
To tourin' out the country and now we switchin' planes
They try and kill my mind and my body
Coke Boys, new illuminati

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
When it comes to stuntin' I'm like money man meech
Brought my city with me and we coming in the fleet
And now I'm gettin' richer they want me in these streets
I'm thinkin' fuck an album sell, I sold a hundred bricks this week
Thousand grams of crack, take it to the table
Bag it all up, take it to the label
And tell em distrubute it Im gettin' cake ridiculous
Right like a frog jumpin through the traffic ribbit
They tellin' me to turn down, they said I need ritalin
Ballin' like I'm Jordan or assists from Scottie Pippen'
In and out the flows, crossing over like I'm dribblin'
Runnin' laps round the raps, I'm tire like Michelin
Started out with Tip and them, but that wasn't it for him
Yellow gold cuban diamonds blue like Michigan

[Bridge][Hook: Lady]
Just another day livin' in the hood
Just another day around the way
I'm still on my coke boy wave
I duck the D's and I'm here to stay
[X2]

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]
New keys to that 7-room fortress
My real-estate broker sent the fax from his office
The game I'm givin' out's worth a fortune
Remember we ain't have a drop of clean water in the faucet
Now it's 7's in the front lawn
Game we gon' bogard
Eli to Packs tell my block runners go long
Gettin' straight to that money I don't prolong
All this frozen water on me nigga need a coat on
The haters talkin' bout me I don't hear a peep
With just a little bit of faith ima take a leap
Fresh fitted home game Yankee Stadium
Bullets like stylists they'll decorate your cranium

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chinx Drugz]
Clear the runway, spread my wings then I take off
Light a kush blunt, take a sip, shake the hate off
Couple bad bitches poolside
You never see them pictures through a fools eyes
I'm aiming for the top nigga bulls-eye
McLaren fishtailin' on Rodeo Drive
Boss shit put yo money on it
Gotta grease the wheels just to keep the money rollin'
Coke boys run New York, got my tracksuit on
I'm everything you was, tell his ass move on
With them lame niggas talk is rubbish
I move my fam to the suburb but its

Snitches in your building caught the murder on tape

[Hook: Konan]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Fuck you, I got a good lawyer
Gold chain, Golden boy, French De La Hoya
Cocaine, no brain when I pull the toy up
Rope chains, made millions off the dope game
Man shooters they shoot, they don’t talk
Killer don’t waste my time
If that watch don't cost about 50
Jeweller don’t waste my time
She said you gonna be my big daddy
Tell her don’t waste my time, don’t hit my line
Bitch I’m lying
Make a couple mill every deal I sign
Came from the bottom, now my niggas all shining
We gonna hide the body where nobody gon' find him
Sign Illuminati for a 'gatti and a island
When them Coke Boys run up on you, you go hiding

[Hook: Konan]

[Verse 3: Lil' Durk)
Don’t waste my time, bitch I ain’t got a dime
If you ain’t fuckin right now
Call number 9, he just got a number 9 if I call him, he slides
Tax for a brick when I know you gon sleep, nigga think I’m a grouch
Niggas snitching nowadays so I gotta mask up, no time for a line
Real savage shit
Niggas tweet bout the squad, I ain’t having it
I’m talkin empty bottles, mama sittin back with a kind of liquor
Police saying well kinda shit
Out here I’m a homie, no lacking shit
No acting shit, That mac will spit
10 rappers split
Saran wrap the bricks
Louie Jackal with the actin sip
Straight drop, no Activist
No more, my Tommygun chop
Age of 12, niggas taught me how to rob
When's your time? Thinking I’ma get it all
Petty hustle tryna turn up with a ball
In the hood, spit grips and try to ball
Niggas mad cos I just want it all
In the slammer two times when a nigga out here
Nigga never gave me a call

[Hook: Konan][Hook: Konan]
If she ain't fucking, she got to go
Tell her, 'don't waste my time'
Police want to stop me, search my clothes
Tell 'em, 'don't waste my time'
If it ain't money, I ain't involved
Tell 'em, 'don't waste my time'
Wasteman waffling down my phone
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (nah nah nah)

Tell 'em, don't waste my time (kaboom)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (oh yea)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (na)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (nah nah nah)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (kaboom)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (behave)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (da)
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (nah nah nah)

[Verse 1: Krept]
Pray to The Lord nigga
In this cold world
I'm a born sinner
We pour liquor
Girl come Hova, it's all Jigga
Chicks wanna holla
Can't be my baby mama
Cos I don't need that drama
Unless she Rihanna

[Verse 2: Chip]
When Chip features on a verse
Pay attention to every word
I'm sick and I'll spread these germs
Fucking turn up till there's nowhere to turn
Put the weed in me, I'm a grinder
Got my spliff but I can't find my lighter
Tell an A&R you don't believe in me
Well, I don't believe in you either (dead)
Bitches don't waste my time
Even when they on their reds
Man I call that playing for the Gunners
I'll be shooting in your mouth instead
Look, I hope my mum don't hear this verse
Why are you raving with your empty purse?
See I told Konan I was feeling the original
I had to put the remix in the dirt

[Verse 3: Konan]
Pretty girl on my left
Pretty girl on my right
South side of that river
Tell 'em, don't waste my time (kaboom)
Troubz rolled up and he's buzzing
Screaming out "If they ain't with us then fuck 'em"
Excuse my French, I ain't worried bout nothin'
What?
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin', haaan
Nigga, I ain't worried bout nothin', haaan

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Fuck you, I got a good lawyer
Gold chain, golden boy, French de la Hoya
Cocaine, no brain when I pull the toy up
Rope chains, made millions off the dope game
Man shooters they shoot, they don’t talk
Killa, don’t waste my time
If that watch don't cost about 50
Jeweller don’t waste my time
She said you gonna be my big daddy
Tell her don’t waste my time, don’t hit my line
Bitch I’m lying
Make a couple mill every deal I sign
Came from the bottom, now my niggas all shining
We gon' hide the body where nobody gon' find him
Sign Illuminati for 'gatti and a island
When them Coke Boys run up on you, you go hiding

[Hook: Konan]

[Verse 5: Wretch 32]
From 2-6, I been in here
Next year, I'll be a millionaire
Don't phone me for shit unless you phone me for dick
Then I ask for the pussy and I'll stick it there
Yeah, I got a foul mouth
A foul car and a foul house
A red card get you pow pow
Running out of words every second is a countdown
Rest in peace my nigga from the Fast and the Furious
Life's too short so I spend it with dividends
Buy a new car, I'm in the race with the Lewis'
Took over my area, I do what the Jewish did
Say I'm Illuminati but I'm more like illuminate
Laminated but you're fascinated, daily duppy rated
Tell her, don't waste my time
Swallow my kids don't waste my life (kaboom)

[Verse 6: Chinx Drugz]
If they order anything less than a brick
Nigga don’t waste my time
These hoes ain’t fucking me and all my niggas
Tell her, 'don’t waste my time'
Nigga they don't want 20 seconds on the clock
Tell 'em, don’t waste my time
Heard a couple niggas scheming on my watch
Fuck nigga wanna waste my time
Couple hundred missin out your pocket in the morning
Nigga need to check that bitch, she lying
Label try school me, I’m already on fire
Tell 'em, don’t waste my time
Left wit your bitch right in front of your face
Fuck with no rats, I don’t fuck with no jake
On that but shackled they said sent you upstate
Snitches in your building caught the murder on tape

[Verse 7: Fekky]
Can I get a moment of silence?
Yeah, grew up on the GB blocks
I was ducking them sirens, nah
You can't tell me about violence
Can't tell me about dope
Tell me about whips, I was driving the finest
Ask thots, I had a strap in the whip
Armed boydem behind us
I woke up the dead
I woke up the dead, yeah
Used to have a brick in my lab and a big .44 in the shed (shottas)
Dirty man to the feds
Couple man wanted me dead
I'm still here, fuck them niggas
You heard what I said
Don't waste my time
