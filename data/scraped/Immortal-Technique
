[Verse 1]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern was making a million
Being the illest hustler that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities in other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed

[Hook]
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

[Verse 2]
So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men up in the cife
His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw"
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming "Shut the fuck up and stop moving around"
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he had broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

[Sample]
I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back

[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth?
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there
And right then, he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen, cause the story that I'm telling is true
Cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom, too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black; color is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever[Intro]
Yeah... It's that real this time around
Immortal Technique... Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now motherfucker
Lock and load

[Verse 1]
This is the point of no return, I could never go back
Life without parole, up state shackled and trapped
Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B
Just like the Spanish exterminating Tainos
Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Mother fuckers made me out of self righteous hatred
And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and machete
The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad
The comet killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills, when you misusin' them nigga
The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's temple
Al-Aqsa the name is not coincidental
I know too much, the government is trying to murder me
No coming back like cutting your wrists open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act
So come and get me mother fucker cause I'm not coming back

[Hook]
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore

[Verse 2]
This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalene giving birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of microchips and titanium
The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians, criminal minded
Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it
Southpaw, murderous methodology nigga
Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me nigga
Cause once you past the point you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
So tell me mother fucker, how could you die for the throne
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
Computerized humanity living inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is living and real
Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal
Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie

[Hook]
This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
She was on her way to becoming a college graduate
Wouldn't even stop to talk to the average kid
The type of Latina I'd sit and contemplate marriage with
Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire
Disciplined, intellectual beauty's what I desire
Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
Everyone told me, kicking it to her was hopeless
At first I just thought, she didn't mess with broke kids
The thug niggas always talking about, how they smoke kids
But the rich-sniff-coke kids got no play
"I'm not even interested," is what her body language would say
Everyone around the way, gave up trying to get in it
It didn't matter how good your game was, she wasn't with it
On the block, bitches was jealous, but wouldn't admit it
Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it
Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald's and did-dick
Smoking weed with thoughts of envy, whenever they lit it
She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always trying to copy
But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure
I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn't a cure

[Hook: Jean Grae]
Don't you know that, time waits for no man
Not fate, it's all planned
I'm blessed just to know you
I've loved and I've lost just to hold you all night
Can't find, a reason why
God came, between you and I
If I had the chance again, I'd never let you go
Hold tight to your love, cause you never know

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad
I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad
That I wasn't just another nigga trying to get in it
So every now and then we'd stop and talk for a minute
I didn't have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
On her birthday, I gave her a poem with flowers
Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin's baby shower
We talked about, power to the people and such
We spent more time together but it was never enough
I never tried to sneak a touch, or even cop a feel
I was too interested, in keeping it real
Perfectly honest and complete, she would always call me "cariño"
And never Technique, bought me a new book to read every 2 or 3 weeks
Forever changing the expression of my thoughts when I speak
It was because of her, I even deaded all of my freaks
She convinced me, to stop hanging out on the streets
To stop robbing and stealing, from people like you
Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
Museo del Barrio and the Metropolitan too
Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
So I decided one day, to tell her my feelings was true
I couldn't live without her so I told her, facing my fears
But honey's only response, was a face full of tears
She could only sob hysterically, holding me tight
I tried to speak, but she wouldn't stop until I left sight
I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
Except I didn't burn, I turned cold after that night

[Hook: Jean Grae]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I went on with my life, college and my career
Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
Where the C.O.'s talk to you like they were the overseer
Then I got sent to the hole, when my exit was near
At night in my cell, I'd close my eyes and I'd see her
Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared
Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer
Came back, in tact and on track
But the fact of the matter, is I still felt cold
Even after my mother, hugged me, crying at home
My real niggas would catch me thinking, outta my zone
Fucking lots of different women, but I still felt alone
Relatively well-known around the New York underground
But I kept thinking of her and how we used to be down
The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair
Though gone physically, somehow it was still there
I had to do something, because the shit was too much to bear
So I went and visited the building where she used to live
The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
The way your life done changed
While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
Like her cousin who was on the corner slanging cocaine
Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up, like a mother ought to
But her facial expression changed, when I asked about her daughter

[Hook: Jean Grae]

[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]
She told me that there was a note for me, that was left behind
She had left it there waiting, for such a long time
I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
I saw a tear swelling up in her eye, and then she cursed
She told me where the letter was and I started thinking the worst
Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door
And sure enough there was an envelope with my name on the floor
"Nobody loves you more than me, cariño" is what the letter said

"By the time you get to read this, I'll probably be dead
But when you left in '97 a part of me went to Heaven
I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
But it hurt me, to see what true love really does
Cause even though we never made love, you were all that there was
It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
You made me doubt the way I thought, you made me want to believe
And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me
It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
Baby don't you see, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
Hope didn't exist for me since late in 1993
I died a virgin, I wish I could've given myself to you
I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
Promise that you'll meet me in paradise inevitably
No matter what, I'll keep your love forever with me"
What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
But I remember wishing that I was dead, instead of her
She was buried on August 3rd
The story ends without a sequel
And now you know why Technique, don't fucking fall in love with people
Hold the person that you love closely if they're next to you
The one you love, not the person that'll simply have sex with you
Appreciate them to the fullest extent, and then beyond
Cause you never really know what you got, until it's gone[Immortal Technique: Talking]
The new age is upon us
And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
For those who hide behind the false image of the Son of man
Shall stand before God
It has begun
The beginning of the end
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The voice of racism preachin' the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam
When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right wing, ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall, cause I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave
Indigenous holocaust and the home of the slaves
Corporate America, dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
You really think this country, never sponsored terrorism
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, you still wanna take me to prison
Just cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism

[Refrain]
It's like MK-ULTRA, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
They wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering, generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children

[Verse 2]
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up, like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention, European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
U.S. manufactured missles, and M-16's
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship, blocking out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms, bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word, when the people are starvin'
The average citizen, made to be, blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide, where the bodies are freezin'
And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
Cause you fucked the Middle East, and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA, buggin' my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm tryin' to give the truth, and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the President, and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth, when it looks at you hard

[Refrain]
It's like MK-ULTRA, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinking, causing your perspective to change
They wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government, want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering, generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality
Martial law is coming soon to the hood, to kill you
While you hanging your flag out your project window”

[Immortal Technique: Talking]
The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials
As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldn't speak for men
So shut the fuck up you mindless drone
And you know it's serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant, and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga
Turn off the news and read, nigga
Read... read... read[Verse 1]
I'm obnoxious, motherfucker can't you tell
Run through Little Havana yelling, "Viva Fidel"
Jerking off with the sheets when I stay at hotels
Drinking Bacardi at AA meetings, smoking a L
I'm broke as hell my attitude is no good
Like working for white people after watching Rosewood
So I'm a mercenary, I don't care how I get richer
Like American companies that did business with Hitler
Get the picture nigga, I'm "The Best of Both Worlds"
Without the hidden camera, and the 12 year old girl
Let's face it, you're basic, you aren't half the man that I am
I'll throw your gang sign up, and then I'll spit on my hand
Give me a hundred grand, give me your watch, give me your chain
That's your girl, bitch get over here, give me some brain
I'll bust off on her face, and right after the segment
She'll probably rub it in her pussy, trying to get herself pregnant
I said it I meant it, that's the way I deal with enemies
Like pro lifers that support the death penalty
And don't talk about war when niggas know that you puss
A fucking hypocrite draft-dodger like George Bush
Don't push me nigga, cause I'm close to the edge
And I'll jump off with a rope that's wrapped around your head
Send a dead fetus to my ex on Valentine's Day
The safety's off nigga, so get the fuck out my way

[Hook]
Obnoxious nigga, murderous lyrics
I know that you hear it
Now that I'm getting closer and closer I know that you feel it
You're eating off rap, and I hope you choke on your gimmick
Niggas said hip hop was dead but I'm invoking the spirit
We taking it back in the day to the golden age
When wack motherfuckers used to get thrown off stage
Immortal Technique, I made this the bump in your ride
Or burn it off the internet, and bump it outside
Nigga, we keeping it live, we keeping it live
We keeping it live, we keeping it live
Burn it off the fucking internet, and bump it outside

[Verse 2]
Look motherfucker, my words damage and slaughter
A raging alcoholic like the President's daughters
Disgusting flow like third world country tap water
But before I hit the border, someone give me a quarter
Cause I'mma prank call COP-SHOT just for kicks
Payback for every time that they called me a spic
And Puerto Rican chicks tell me that I fuck like I'm loco
And Dominican women call me the "Rompe Toto"
They call me "ocioso", I'd rather get fired than quit
I get unemployment, you work and we making the same shit
How dare you niggas criticize the way that I spit?
You coffee shop revolutionary son of a bitch
But you know what the fuck I think is just pathetic and gay
When niggas speculate what the fuck 'Pac would say
You don't know shit about a dead man's perspective
And talking shit'll get your neck bone disconnected
Disrespected, niggas don't show no love
Why you trying to be hardcore, you fucking homo-thug?
And don't be sensitive and angry at the shit that I wrote
Cause if you can take a fucking dick, you can take a joke
I'll choke your friends in front of you to prove that you've fallen off
And you won't do shit about it, like the Church during the Holocaust
Kalashnikov machine gun flow that I fire
Obnoxious until they shoot me on the day I retire

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Damn homie, in high school I beat the shit out of you and your man, homie
Your girl wanna blow me and don't even know me
She lonely and she think you a phony
I take a piss on a development deal from Sony, or Def Jam
Cause you like all of the rest, man
This ain't a verse, this shit talk at the end of the song
And you can suck a dick if you think I ended it wrong
Fuck you and I'm gone, ha ha ha ha
Peace to the Stronghold, EO dub
Word-A-Mouf, Forbidden Chapters
IAK niggas, Wax Poe, killing you slow
The Plague, I'll murder a show, you don't even know[Verse 1: Diabolic]
I two-step with Lucifer and ever since I started dancin’
I’ve walked a fine line between Einstein and Charles Manson
Starving in this famine with my stomach growling
Like someone shouting, a hundred thousand times louder than thunder pounding
Fuck around and I’ll punch you’re mouth in
I’m king of the mountain with my life in this project like it's public housing
Countin' on the fact I firebomb entire songs
And won’t stop until the worlds inside my palm like Viacom
Diabolic I’ll supply the higher wattage via fiber optic wire
Until you acquire some kinda knowledge
Cause life made me grow wiser than old-timers
Hot-headed like the ghost rider behind a slow driver
Sole survivor flowing lava’s second nature
So don’t test its best to save your breath like respirators
I’ll throw a punch at your ribs that gives your lungs asthma
And has you pouring out your guts faster than Dutch Masters
Drunk bastard past the point of no return
Like Denzel tricking Ethan Hawke into smoking sherm
Judgement overturned held in court like Mordecai
Immortalized when I make statues bleed and portraits cry
I’ll go to war for mine, Rebel Army guard the border
I’m in the trenches barking orders like I’m Sergeant Slaughter
Pray to Jesus H. for mercy and plead your case
Cause on the frontlines you’re dead the second that you see my face

[Hook x2: Immortal Technique and Diabolic]
This is the frontline
This is the dead-zone
Barely alive or in a box is how you head home
This is the frontline
This is the life that I chose
I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They said that the success of my music was theoretic
But my revenge is sweet enough to murder diabetics
Eugenics Procter and Gamble credit racial science
Couldn't produce a more aggressive intellectual giant
Nephilim, bury em' with the bullets left in them
My heart is blacker than the children of Thomas Jefferson
Blacker than back in the days of tar and featherin'
A cancerous endocrine the eagle that's American
The hatchet and the sticks the fascist emblem
You could call it conspiracy theory
I don't give a motherfuck
You could get your mother fucked
National security's a code-word for cover-up
Hold that down I look at character
Never let the color get to ya
I got white Revolutionaries like Muslims in Chechnya
Percussion thumping like the Russian Mafia over ya
But even they know what it's like when you fighting for Svoboda
So whether Slavic or Islamic vodka/gin tonic
Drunken fantasies are cool son but here's the grim logic
You niggas wanna play industry and starve to be rich
Until they fuck you for millions like Paul McCartney's bitch
My lions live inside a box like Jumanji
Sikh niggas that'll stab you up like Indira Gandhi
So never desecrate the space on which I meditate
My thoughts rip through tank-armored metalplates
And start to resonate to the spot where Moses caused the sea to separate
The place that the Prophet Muhammad started to levitate
The exact moment that Jesus rose dead awake
And Siddhartha became the Buddha that regenerates
Half a bar over but I bring it home colder than dead soldiers
Soul controller holder of knowledge so fuck Dianetics
I'm like the whole library in Kemet with Annunaki genetics

[Hook]

[Outro: Immortal Technique and Diabolic]
This is the Frontline the people first; one time
Thirty-two and a little somethin' ah ha ha
33-Degrees motherfucka go home and figure it out[Produced by Omen]

[Intro]
Immortal Technique
Revolutionary Volume 2
Yeah, broadcastin' live from Harlem, New York
Let the truth be known

[Verse 1]
You better watch what the fuck flies outta your mouth
Or I'mma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be...a more wicked MC
Cause AIDS-infected child molesters aren't sicker than me
I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich
Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, 'cuz God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
My words'll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
And you can't fathom the truth, so you don't hear me
You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory
That's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit
And your phone is tapped by the Federal Government
So I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me
Technique will rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, because I'm never hesitant
Sniper scopin' a commission controllin' the President

[Hook]
Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong
The truth will set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the Cause of Death written in code
The Word of God brought to life, that'll save ya soul
Save your soul motherfucker, save your soul

[Verse 2]
I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps. flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
Now here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind
They gave Al Qaeda 6 billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn't the closest
I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom
I can't believe you bought that excuse
Rockin a motherfucking flag don't make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The devil crept into heaven
God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September eleventh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And just so conservatives don't take it to heart
I don't think Bush did it, cause he isn't that smart
He's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin' and lockin'
Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq
Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell them your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis
In '98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the Government lies
Read it yourself instead of asking the Government why
Cause then the cause of death will cause the propaganda to die

[Outro]
He is scheduled for 60 Minutes next
He is going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television
People everywhere are starting to listen to him
It's embarrassing[Poison Pen talking]
Yo, this Poison Pen
The album, its called The Money Shot

[Immortal Technique talking]
Most of yall muthafuckaz
Yall ‘Don’t even know what your rights are
You think your rights the opposite of your left (ahaha)
We have these rights, guaranteed to us
(Poison Pen – You ain't taking my burner nigga)
And once they get revoked...
(you gotta cut my finger off nigga)
Bueno es hora de revolución muthafucka!

[Immortal Technique]
I keep a burner stashed
Loaded up with hollow tips
Cause’ politics can turn your city into the Gaza Strip
Military industry, justify sales like a drug dealer lyrically
Fucked up physically
But halving two sides doesn’t imply symmetry
Cause’ Philly to Filastin, our children are fricassee
Times up, like the Celestine prophecy
My paper is folded now, no more chances to copy me
Them ghetto philosophies will get yourself killed
If I don’t sell them the product “somebody else will”
America, like it or not, I represent you
You teach me and sell me the weapons to use against you
My stray hands used to sack cities for New York bitch
Now im Alaric, Gaiseric, four seventy six
Smart muthafuckaz from the hood learn history
Stupid niggas never learn shit and die religiously!

[Hook: Poison Pen and Immortal Technique]
Rebel Armz Locked and Loaded
The only law once the government is corroded
(2nd Amendment)
My life might be intense
But my rights will not be infringed
(2nd Amendment)
Is it propaganda for weapon companies
Or necessity in the country we see
(2nd Amendment)
Yeah, know this ___________
Not for whilin’ just for checks and balance
(2nd Amendment)

[Poison Pen]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down on my side
No frontin’ just incase I gotta smoke somethin’
Sa gloves just incase I gotta choke somethin’
Hawk out just incase I gotta poke somethin’
Dirty dirty just incase I gotta go huntin’
Open case in the city, I don’t know nothin’
Random macs (no) you wanna play my circle?
My pedigree is made to _____ you
But we’ll hurt you!

[Immortal Technique]
Reverse AIDS commercial
Death equals silence
Anarchist, El Violen, reactionary violent
Cursed music out of a red violin
Only republicans I fuck with live in Northern Ireland
Warrior chief liken the beast from the east
Drive-by in the drive-thru, we share beef with police
One for the Bronx, for Queens, for them Oakland streets
Fuckin’ empty the clip in em’ for my peoples in Greece
Nigga!

[Hook]

[Poison Pen]
Mr Obama, congratulations on that win
Don't take away my right to hold my llama
I’m a citizen, like that dude in that militia
No felonies, unlike that dude in that militia
Antebellum statues paved the way for me
It’s registered with the state dawg
Its day of the siege
Police won't protect me, the beast won't protect me
I stand back to back with the gats with Technique
We called "Rebel Armz" for a reason
I defend hoods with heaterz
Like Condoleeza’s pops
Pack off, Pop off, on them evil cops
Torch yours, I torch mine
That's when the bleeding stop
Tryna’ confiscate mine
So you can catch and drive my grey piece
I’m Haiti in the seventy nineties (Sak Pasé)
Control em’, border
The government sponsored slaughter
We supreme
Revolution, how this land was founded

[Hook]

[Immortal Technique talking]
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Poison Pen
Stronghold / Rebel Armz
Hahaha
You gotta know your rights pussy
So that, when they break the law on you
You know how to break the law on them
Hahaaha...[Intro: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, one two
Yeah, it's the God of the Serengeti
I'm the god of the seven deadly
Immortal Technique, Poison Pen what up?
G.O.D, Jus Allah
Tony Kenyatta, what up baby?

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Supreme Godhead, gutter like poverty
Righteous man is one of forty six parts prophecy
It’s epicyclical orbit like the hypotheses
It’s metaphysics that borders on the philosophy
Another song of yours is just another disaster
Another verse of mine is just another cadaver
You could call it a Genesis of another chapter
You could call it the venom that’s from the troubled rapper
The same rapper that was known for just smashing your face in
Who is God? What’s material manifestation?
I’m indestructible, my actions are that of a Mason
Yamasee Native American tribe of relations
The judge threw the book at me, I take it in blood
The rook move horizontally, basically drugs
A nation of intellectuals, a nation of thugs
Jesus is hate, a nation of Satan is love

[Hook: Poison Pen]
With a fist full of twenties, got my mind right
With a fifth full of henny, we Team Homicide
We swing side to side, so what’s happening’?
So what’s crackin’? So what’s stackin’?
If we falling out, then we brawling out
Vinnie chalk ‘em out, ain’t nothing to talk about
Team Homicide, swing side to side, so what’s happening’?
Yo, what’s happening? It’s all that shit...

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Me and my conglomerates shall survive Apocalypse
I charge a price for telling people what the process is
Living in a world where dictatorship is obvious
Natural resources running out for the populace
Murder doesn’t need a lobbyist or an ambassador
Ask the survivors of the Mỹ Lai massacre
‘Back to the Future’ without the flux capacitor
Kill you for the gold like Colonel Gaddafi characters
You bath salt sniffin’ zombies fuckin' a stranger
Navajo skin walkers, nigga, I’m a face changer
Surgically remove your heart, bury it at Wounded Knee
A microcosm of the graveyard that Earth is soon to be
A eulogy for those chasing cars and jewelry
I’m stocking food and water cause shit ain't what it used to be
I’m motivated like Buster Douglas when his mother died
Border Patrol, nigga, see you on the other side

[Hook][Verse 1: Planetary]
Battling Plan's a bad plan
I'm raw like cats from Afghanistan with gats in their hands
From Philly to Pakistan 'space packin the stands
You make all fake thugs start acting like Stans
You'll never make your move cuz you lackin the fans
I been illin' since I had a backpack full a cans
You see life pass by you in the blink of an eye
Thinkin you fly, we'll choke you in the sink till you die
You spit lava rap, so holla back if need be
You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay
It's gruesome, I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
Such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
Obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
I'm so confused, take the world away

[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
You in the land of stars when the block is enormous
Squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
Flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
Droppin candy rappers that get chopped up and snorted
Newborn kids they get chopped up, aborted
Planet warchild, when we pop up report it
Committin riot acts so we constantly torch it
Illest Puerto-Rock this whole process is morbid
Equipped with slaughter blocks, you get the picture-a portrait
If it ain't monetary, what's your reason for touring
All that shit you pop, to be honest it's boring
Been rockin the mic since before inter-corporate
You need to sit back and let your conscience absorb this
Before you ship that demo to them dudes in the office
Come test your skills for real in hell's fortress

[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth
Or on the sea, or on any tree
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise
Having the seal of the living god
He cried with a loud voice to the four angels
I'm so confused
To whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, I live life strangling death
I walk through the land where the fallen angel is kept
But I will never bow down to a Pagan habit
Like Roman gods that were faggots named after the planets
The connotations of Revelation taken for granted
Mark of the beast, government microchips implanted
I'll be branded a maniac for speaking the truth
And I'll be murdered as soon as I hit the street with the proof
Illuminati trying to raise the devil at any cost
They probably cloned Jesus with the blood off of the cross
And I know that it's the same mother fuckers I see
That genetically engineered HIV
Controlling the population according to mathematics
Generated by Masons and the military industry
Sponsoring terror, creatin the profit margin that'll last forever
The crusades and Vietnam sand-blasted together
And you believe in "whatever", even a Federal promise
But the spawn of Shaytan could never be honest
And poor people pay homage and pray to a god
That the Vatican themselves don't really believe in
Cuz they'd rather worship money and the physical demons
Without biblical reason I execute em for treason
I don't need an alibi, cuz my place in history is the book of Malachi
Motherfucker

[Outro]
Immortal Technique; Harlem, New York and North Philly
The Angels of Death are here you motherfucker
We'll turn your cities to salt, nigga
Y'all ain't shit, and none of your peoples are shit
None of your children are shit
You'll all be dead tomorrow, you fake motherfuckers
What!?[Intro]
What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?
I see you. I see you standing over the grave of another dead President

[Hook: Bazaar Royale]
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fighting over heaven, heaven, heaven
It's real

[Verse 1: stic.man]
America's nightmare; young, black, and just don't give a fuck
Run up in the courtroom and wet 'em up
Got nothin' to lose but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
It's war time, everything is fair, no fear
When they say the homie murdered the judge, I don't care
Fuck 'em, he deserved it, long as the homie get away
And don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it
We rootin' for the vellein of black
Pourin' out Absolut, salute, niggas is shootin' back
In self-defense we bang the pistol like
Larry Davis or Brian Nichols
Every pig, every public official, the boomerang
Is coming back to get you, you reap what you sow, did you?
The system you created created a monster
And now you scared cause it's coming back to haunt you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: M-1]
Since we gonna take the blame, I'mma rep my name to get my aim right
Let's have an overthrow and after party in the same night
Same height as Huey, same muscle build as Malcolm
With the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Don't take this as a warning, just another nigga rappin'
Fuck the way we organizing, fuck the training and the grapplin'
And fuck them Uncle Toms who call police because we smack them
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
Cause we bangin' on the system, G'd up, fuck the factions
And if you didn't know, the G was for George Jackson
And long live his warrior spirit packin' the Magnum
Watching over the soldiers, knowin' niggas be blackin'
When we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'
Till then, inside the blood of my eye, you see the dragon

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I'm like the birth of baby Mohammed, the movement I started
Can spar with the hardest, the martyr regarded as Spartacus-hearted
It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
When you're a target in an Afghan Teutoberg Forest
Close quarters combat over corrupted elections
Bilderberg is like cancer, it grows an infection
Nepotism is the gold and the conductor's connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military ain't there for the people's protection
They're just there to protect an investment
That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are infested with those tired of protestin'
Traumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons
9/11 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
That no matter what you think, occupation is not victory

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Somalia, Kashmir
Nigeria, Palestine
Iraq, bring it back

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Ayo, you're blind to the fact, cause you're a coward and a dreamer
A pussy like Nazis hiding in Argentina
Pop shit, I'll catch you quicker than a misdemeanor
And put you in a fucking box next to Selena
Cause I'm the meanest motherfucker you could ever imagine
Incarcerate the universe inside a single atom
But since the populous can't fathom space n' stars
I spit razor-blades that cover your face with scars
Killing you on the spot like you saw the face of God
Empty the clip in you and load 16 for your squad
Dying is easy, but living with Satan's gonna be hard
I spit revolutionary bars that'll touch ya'
Bolshevik status; murder you, like the King of Russia
And on your tombstone chisel "Fake motherfucker"
Cocksucker, I played you
Cause I'm the God, but I wouldn't send my son to save you
I gave you the pieces to reconstruct the world and the past
But all you could was ridicule the future and laugh
So Imma' split you in half, machine gun to your belly
And then I'll piss all over your little sister like R. Kelly
I got more connections than illegal selling microchips
To hunt you down after I destroy the mic when I spit
Immortal Technique bitch!
I'm a real lyricist
Other people just use Jay-Z as their ventriloquist
Now run and tell your boss, you mothafuckin' snitch

[Verse 2: D. Rymz]
Most cats can't remember me cause my brain shaking energy
Mentally hitting victims so hard they lose they memory
And generally, you'd rather go to hell than be my enemy
You're meant to be with a foot in the chest, there's the penalty
Divide then mutilate drum beats
Before I touch a MC in the cypher, I lubricate the tough piece
Spin against his Earth till' his reality's reversed
So when he spits his best verse, it comes out as his worse
So life begins in a hearse and ends it with birth
So everything that he hate, he loves until it hurts
My logic is sick
All you chumps gotta get sticked
Hot as the clip that was dipped up in the bottomless pit
With knowledge equipped
I thieve on the foolish
Reason I knew this
Jesus and Judas, Caesar and Brutus
David Goliath, I'm seizing Divine
You heathens are blind
Be warned, I storm like all four seasons combined
Carve your extremities like mob in the Genovese
Heat the part of the brain in charge of the memories
Dudes done forgot how we starved in the 70's
Sons continuing wars
Our fathers were enemies
In these dark spots the Don bomb like the Lebanese
The wicked trying to replace God with celebrities
You heard me
The wicked trying to replace God with celebrities

[Hook x2]
Too real
Too fake you trying to be
My powerful words something you ain't trying to see
A real lyricist, in depth, so honor me
I am what you not
I'm an anomaly[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
The system, can never stop what's been set into motion
Like volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean
My purpose is to burst to the surface
Immersed in the smoldering lava from verses
Surrounded by, murder mamis not bitches that's worthless
I cut chicken heads off, like hexes and curses, weapons I purchase
Make Homeland Security nervous; I run, pockets and purses
Like subway searchers robbin masonic temples disguised as churches
I'm busy so I'll leave that one for you to interpret
Three serpents of merchants from military industry murder
The beef is eatin up, like the mad cow in your burger
Fathom the cause of cattle cannibalism
Factory farms, are like a fuckin animal prison
The microcosm of, Adam Smith's capitalism
America's pagan religion given as the mark of the beast to the Christians
A destruction of, Babylon, that's my mission!

[Refrain: Immortal Technique]
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Motherfuckin right soldier, this is the apocalypse!
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Waitin for 2012's burning apocalypse

[Verse 2: Akir]
Sex, drugs, and murder, webcams and burgers
Check scams and lurkers, test scans to purpose
Sect crams to further, death plans and workers
Get canned you nervous as you step, plan that hurts us
It's demand to be purchased, we can care if you serve us
We programmed to be perfect, frequent handed the serpents
An amazement on purpose, see I'm amazin my earners
But now the tables is turnin, got my hand right on that curtain
Hit the stages and burn it, with these pages I earn this
Can't take it, I'm nervous while fake enemies perp'in
Foul energies worth and, crowds' ears'll be perkin'
Take it somethin disturbin and it's hurtin for certain
Yearnin to get my turn in, workin to get a word in
Been in the scene observin while I'm learnin how the system's worked and
Capitalistic merchants tryin to make a million urgent
Constructive revolution confusin how the world's burnin'

[Refrain x2: Akir]
Everywhere I get 'em go, the beast watchin us
Know we got the spot in control, they got binoculars
When we be, out on the road they try to follow us
You never gon' silence this, this is the apocalypse

[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
You have now acquired an old cyrus hybrid, work 'til my third iris
Chip inside my brain projects scriptures onto my eyelids
Celibacy, virtual sex, avoid the virus
Secretive shit that I did will put the city at high risk
The mentalist, the temple that houses the wisdom
It's like, Malcolm X calculus amalgamated algorithms
They say "Pharoahe, teach me about the system"
Nigga boot me in your computer I'll give you acute astigmatism
See through Windows, Word, Pharoahe's the Mac Intel
Bit off the Apple, plant seeds, spit crack Excel
Lyrical FireFox, the verbal Explorer
Who metaphors the industry to Sodom and Gomorrah for ya
They profit from water, they'll profit from oxygen
Pharoahe the prophet says that this is the apocalypse
We livin in these last days, use your optics what the topic is
The coppers got binoculars, they'll probably try to knock us cause

[Refrain: Pharoahe Monch, Immortal Technique]
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Satellites observin the fulfillment of the prophecy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no apologies
[IT] Cause none of you got an apocalypse insurance policy
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Fascism breakin out of the cocoon of democracy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no apologies
[IT] Iraq was just practice for the urban war philosophy

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Ha ha ha, AH-hahahahaha
It's burnin in here, call the Fyre Dept
Akir, aiyyo Pharoahe
They ain't never gon' find this shit man
Ha ha ha ha, like the weapons of mass destruction[Hook 1: DV Alias Khrist]
This game is cold, I told my broad I won't be coming home
I lost my job, I lost my mind, lost everything I own
The city got me fucked up.. yo these pigs got me fucked up..
Music on the radio is fucked up, I hop in the truck and only want to feel the pain

[Hook 2: Chino XL]
Chino XL, and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
What the fuck happened to rap? I need to put my lyrical clip in
It’s on homie, gun clapping is back
These pop acts make me wanna pop gats
This whole shit is fucked up coz radio just broadcast trash
Surround the wack, blast my semi-auto tracks
Launching deadly hollow caps and taking out the whack
And many follow that, swallow that...
I’ll burn you vocal like a bottle Jack
You thought you had the streets coz I was gone
Well we just got ‘em back! Homie you can check my team
It’s super ugly when you get us all together, Sick, Tech & Chi
This reign of terror won't end with me
I spawned a little psycho coz my baby momma kept that seed
Now I'mma take a little trip to these radio stations
Grab them punk ass DJs, wave guns in their faces
If they don’t play my shit then it’s “Welcome to Hell”
Coz all we want is Immortal Tech, Chino & the Psycho Realm!

[Hook 1]

[Hook 3: Chino XL]
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Chino XL and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!

[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Chino’s ill, slap off your cosmetics
I arm myself like a veteran putting on prosthetics
My barbaric genetics bring pain
The only Revolution that you’ve ever seen is Prince’s group in Purple Rain
Deranged monster is sponsored
You get shit on and pissed on like Tila Tequila at a Juggalos concert
Ain’t tryna be glamorous, hammers we snap like cameras
I’m fuckin’ intense like teenage camp councilors
Spit blood through your stereo, there we go, time for your burial
Fag niggas, after you rhyme say no hetero (hahaha)
My murderous sentences, no secrets where my weapons is
Locked in the closet next to pop rappers' sexual preferences
Amber alert, your girl's mouth ran away with my kids
If you’re sick then I should be diagnosed with three days to live
You slip I kidnap you and give you a mean death
Beat you with your Blackberry till there's barely a screen left
Jack and Tech my dawgs like Andrés in the Philippines
My mistress is villainy, rape and pillage ‘em lyrically
My symphony's sinfully biblically loved by killers
Who gives a fuck who’s the greatest rapper alive as-long as Chino’s the illest!

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Fuck a silent Revolution, soldier, I'm on the warpath
I’ll throw my commandments down on your platinum calf
You'll get your face slashed like a Rikers Island reminder
Behind ya snipers will find ya whether you run to China
Or try to crawl the fuck back in your mother's vagina, (bitch!)
And I don't need a fuckin' co-signer (hahaha)
To murder gassed up underground niggas like coal miners
Bring it back paying homage to the old timers
I was bred as a carnivore, bred as a cannibal
Flow sicker than pictures of people fuckin' animals
Like a car crash ripped in half neck to the crotch
Muthafuckas scared to stare but they secretly watch
Niggas wanna play Shaytan? Well let's get it on
I fire missiles like the fuckin' shit that hit the Pentagon
You not strong enough to do a song with me I'm the truth
Like Tina Turner motherfucker, you'll get raped in a booth!

[Hook 1]

[Hook 3](Verse 1)
JS-1, Technique, L.I.F.E. Long, Yo
I only role with two masta turntablists
Goose with ya record making wax and needles kiss
Not these amateurs only relying on playlists
My man JS-1'll make vinyls say ouch, from the cuts and scratch
Even Technique can vouch, why your DJ's just learning to speak with hands
Most these jockies ain't really moving no jams
Just sittin back gettin' under the table payola
Weak mixtapes with MC's writing tracks with crayola
My peeps be fader freakers spinning crate exclusives
Jugglin wax, got ears vibing off the new shit
While wannabe DJ's got me sleep during they mix
I feel like slicing an axe and detaching fingertips
Now all you gotta do is take note
And watch real turntable technicians show ya'll the ropes
Respect due to DJ's who represent every day all day
Let this shit here play

(Hook)
This for the DJ's who play the real Hip-Hop
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
Turntablers...Audio Technician
JS on the wheels of steel
Can, can break a beat, cut, scratch and transform
{JS-1*scratches*}
Ground original...I don't need MTV I can smash your clique like 1,2,3

(Verse 2)
Yo...
I conduct guerilla warfare throughout the PJ's
On the government controlled by wack DJ's
Playin' watered-down commercial cause a payola
Taking orders from the label on the 2-way motorolas
Spit solar rays on DJ's who think they raw
Right before I break your fingers off on a car door
And I'm give your girl a C-section with a chainsaw
And graffiti my name with the blood stains on the floor
Hardcore on a fake turntablist brotha, you wack niggas blend
Like yellow and purple colors, motherfucka nobody wanna hire a decoy
You couldn't spin in the club as a fuckin B-boy
Cause juvenile cats don't get the big picture, gimme dat Vestax
And go back to your Fisher Price mixa
I'm about to hit ya like da pentagon after I take off
Yo JS-1 cut this mothafuckas face off

{JS-1*scratches*}
Train train train and chuck chuck chuck
{*continues scratching*}
Cut cut cut, cut like a guillotine
{*continues scratching*}
Any questions?

(Hook)
This for the DJ's who play the real Hip-Hop
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
Turntablers...Audio Technician
JS on the wheels of steel
Can, can break a beat, cut, scratch and transform
{JS-1*scratches*}
Y'all original...I don't need MTV I can smash your clique like 1,2,3
(Fade)Look, let me make something abundantly clear for people
That are so bereft of activities
They feel like they gotta comment on every one of mine
First of all, being a vegetarian should never be associated
With being a revolutionary or being open minded, that's a dietary choice
If someone wants to proliferate the type of ignorance
We're supposed to be fighting by thinking that, you're just fucking yourself
I don't go around promoting beef and poultry shoving it in peoples faces
I don't castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches
And I would never diss someone for being a fucking broccoli head
Or living off radishes or eating grass with tofu
I like a lot of vegan cuisine but the illogicality
Of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea
Of what being healthy is, is just preposterous
I've seen some of you herbivores, and if you wanna argue health
Y'all need to eat some kind of supplement
Because some of y'all are so skinny that it's disgusting
Lookin like the only hip hop motherfuckas on Schindler's list
Being a malnutrition ass got nothing to do
With being revolutionary or being on point
I'll be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me
You know, I don't eat pork, not cause I'm a Muslim
I just don't really like it, but I really will fuck a bird up
And fish is good when that shit is fresh
It's like my nigga Vast Aire from Can' Ox said
If you don't like the smell of burning meat, then get the fuck off the planet
You know, I don't criticize people for eating moss
And don't open your fuckin mouth about my food man
I like beef and broccoli motherfucka, mind your God damn business
Matter of fact, you know what? I'm out
I feel like asome arroz con pollo, a banana daiquiri
And a motherfuckin bistec apanado[Intro]

This hip-hop verse is somewhat of a change, somewhat of a revolutionary exchange
See, in fact this is going to be directed to all the Uncle Toms of the 20th century, and the 21st century to come
See, cause they think propping up, but we prop up too
Here we go...

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]

Immortal Technique disperse perverse verses
The gospel of fallen angels heading below the Earth's surface
A sermon written by the CIA for Catholic churches
I make you look back on your life and think that it's worthless
Murderous curses leave the population nervous
When I burn it's beyond recognition
This song is a mission; bomb your position
How you gonna read the future, nigga?
When your palms are missing?
I'm stronger than corrupted religion
Stuck in the system of syllables I chopped up over intervals
I'm the sickest most ridiculous nigga
Sicker than sickle cell, sick of my cell
A white man's prison, a brown and black man's hell
I flip the topics from universal to microscopic
Burn out your optics and make you listen to me
Like conservative America's, motherfucking version of history
But now I'm reconnected with the culture you stole
Lyrical symmetry enter two gun shots in your soul
The cops shot Diallo right in-front of his home
And Giuliani don't got a conscience like Ariel Sharon
Rappers are clones manufactured by the industry
Dismantled, but now produced independently
The government wants to take away freedom of speech
And it becomes real when niggas don't prosper or teach[Intro: Mos Def]
Man you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day, man
It's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what I'm sayin
It's wild
Listen

[Hook x2: Mos Def]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I pledge no allegiance
Nigga, fuck the President's speeches
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Act will track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you
And say you was trying sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shit is run by fake Christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions
Then look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen
But they don't really tell you they mission
They funded Al-Qaeda and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11
That's just scratching the surface

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit
I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem
And Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fighting for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fighting for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fighting to keep the occupation out, my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit, or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you
And was raping your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
After Ronald Reagan's election
Mercenary contractors fighting a new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror
They controlling the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryna distract the fact that they engineering the crack
So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo holding a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids and I don't mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue
Stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggas that support you and like you
Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal

[Eminem]
I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead
It's never been said but I set precedents)

[Hook - Mos Def]

[Eminem]
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours"I want the world to know you won't beat us because we're the children of those who took the worst fall, of slavery and brutality that ever lived, that ever existed. Our parents survived the Middle Passage. Only the strong got here, and then we lost our name, our culture, our religion, and we're still here. So you may have a momentary victory Mr. Bush, but you don't know who we are."

[Immortal]
I pledge no allegiance, fuck the President's speeches
What the industry did to 'Pac they did to Jesus
Raping his vocals and then destroying the message
Tryna deport us if they can't destroy and arrest us
Government front religious, but their heart is empty
Like a televangelist preaching out of his Bentley
Calling abortion murder in a medical building
But don't give a fuck about bombing Iraqi children
Talking like units in the fucking libretto
Look at their mansions and look at your suburban ghetto
The gulag, the new hood where they send us to live
Cause they don't give a fuck about none of our kids
That's why Blacks and Latinos get the worst education
While devils run America like "Birth of a Nation"
Affirmative action ain't reverse discrimination
That shit is a pathetic excuse for reparations

[Hook: Immortal + KRS]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
It was you!
Bush knocked down the towers
It was you, nigga
(It was you) It was you motherfucker

[Immortal]
They say that terrorism revolves around the Qur'an
But that's stupid, I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cause if this country was invaded and crumbled
I'd turn Harlem into a Columbian jungle
And I wouldn't be fighting for a Christian nation
I'd be fighting for survival from extermination
I wouldn't fight for Fox News, them racist niggas
I'd be fighting for the hood, for the faceless niggas
For the immigrants America loves to despise
Even though it needs them to make the economy rise
They feed us genetically modified garbage
So I repetitively reload the cartridge
Boston, New York, down to Atlanta
Guerilla war in the swamps of Louisiana
Camera panoramas of hammers couldn't rock me
East coast to West coast you can't stop me
And fuck Schwarzenegger, his pops was a Nazi
And it runs in the family so run for the Grammy's
Run to the coon picnic and try to pick up a mammy
But half of y'all are faggots trying to pick up a tranny
Eddie Murphy ass motherfuckers going commercial
Even Interscope is getting pimped by Universal
Green Tutankhamen Lantern I curse you and murked you
But the Bin Laden slush fund remix just burked you

[Hook][Skit from 'Planet Of The Apes']
Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death

[Poison Pen]
Yeah! Immortal Technique! SP the Ghost! Poison Pen! Vinnie Paz!

We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle ??? out
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain’t nothing civilized about no uncle ??? nigga, you feel me? Don’t bring no uncle ??? out nigga, fuck outta here

[Immortal Technique]
All troops in formation? Let the siege commence!

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Back like I was locked up, putting in work
Burning through books like Nazi's in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother
I'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the god of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type
That'll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu, niggas that be bleaching their skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you
Barbarian funeral, nigga, you wanna know?
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow

[Hook: Poison Pen]
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder
Pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Cut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head
Immortal and Ghost coming, code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior, warlord, pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword and get shit sawed off
Your throat need an axe in it
And I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate
The Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines
How you wanna die? Make your own suggestion
Now talk to the lord and make your own confession

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
You pussies living in a movie theatre
Put the motherfucking spell on you like brujeria
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
You need to be godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me, like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking toaster for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with bags of dust like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in Dashiki and stab wounds
I'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors
That's a part of my neurological transmitters
We Islamic and brought the story of shem with us (Al hamdu Allah!)
While we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us

[Hook]

[Outro]
The walls have been breached! ANFALL!!!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
No one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins...[Produsert av Tommy Tee]

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Bambaataa told us knowledge was the fifth element
Truth behind the lies is what the music represents
So how the fuck you gonna have a peace settlement? (How?)
When people want a piece of your land to build settlements
There’s all different kinda terrorism you can perpetrate
Every dead body causes karma to circulate
There’s suicide bombin' buildings full of civilians
Or cutting off water to cities full of children
You can’t try to justify collective punishment, (Why?)
Our country never finds peace with bodies buried under it
I guess some Americans just don’t remember
There’s a slave graveyard under the World Trade Center
Stop the criticism of Iranian nuclear fission
Until mutual nuclear disarmaments’ the mission
This ain’t about religion, Muslim, Jew or Christian
It’s about people making money off of that division

[Verse 2: El Tipo Este]
Sin que medien armamentos
Digo siempre es buen momento
Pa iniciar entendimiento
Es demasiado el desencuentro, siento
Que el respeto debe ser boleto al parlamento
Es el respeto el primer paso
Sino lo que sigue es cuene
Es un complejo asunto cuando tiempo son cientos de años
El premio al mayor daño para los de menor tamaño
Me empeño a no estar de acuerdo con ninguna posicion que implique
A lo mas tu adversion de discriminacion, brother
Violencia intolerancia en cualquier forma de expresion
Mas alla de cualquier religion, vision de obsesion
Boicot, boycott, boikott
Hay que hacer no solamente hablar, boicot Israel

[Verse 3: Tumi]
I am recognizing that the voices in my head
Are urging me to be myself and never follow when I’m lead
So with that said, it’s as urgent, see as we come from some things
I am anti Zionist and many fundamentalist
The devil’s in the specifics, mix him with your favorite dish
You can beef with Israel and not be anti Semitic
Don’t buy beef from Israel, ‘cause you paying to kill them kids
So if you rockin’ this shit, go ‘head do the Gaza Strip
My heart race when I hear a politic from off their lips
We have lifted, missed Olympics, seen “Free Mandela” pickets
And this image has been repeated, a little street for village children
Even feeds from pissin' ‘cause of global criticism
Of this horrible system boycotted by the citizens

[Verse 4: Tonto Noiza]
Il n'y a qu'un pas d'hypocrisie à la diplomatie
Rester là assis devant la situation assis
C'est pas l'image que j'ai d'un homme droit
Car l’immunité qu'Israël s'octroie me choque moi
Regarde la pauvreté d'un peuple
Comment relativiser
C'est le pouvoir qu'il faut briser
J'viens viser sans stigmatiser
J'suis pas venu pour stigmatiser
Comme l'ONU, ni attiser la haine
Mais l'inégalité qu'la mauvaise fois entraîne a décuplé ma peine
C'est aux instances dirigeantes que je m'adresse car on agresse
Aux prix d'erreurs passées c'est tout un peuple que l'on oppresse
à tous les opposants de tous les camps que cette lutte emporte
L'addition est plus salée que la Mer Morte faut qu'on l'emporte

[Verse 5: Don Martin]
Granater regner over Gazas tak
Treffer sykehus, treffer barnehagebarn, treffer sovesal
Det er klart det er snakk om en Apartheid-stat
De bygger opp en mur mellom seg og de som ikke skal ha borgerskap
For hvis du kaller noe pro-palestinsk
Så plutselig gjelder ikke regler du kan tro at det gir
En helt makaber annen klang til ordet "Blodappelsin"
Om den er dyrket I stjålet jord og gror fra et lik
Ikke I mitt navn, ikke for mine penger
Det holder slettes ikke å sitte rundt og grine lenger
Så vi må ramme fundamentet, vise Israel
For de driter helt I resolusjoner likavel
Bare en liten del av et mye større bilde
Som når vi boikotta Shell da jeg var mye mindre
Ansvaret ligger hoes oss alle, så vi vil ha med
Alle med samvittighet, boikott Israel
Denne teksten kommer fra Rap Genius Norge![Verse 1 - Pumpkinhead]
I’m a beast of the underground
Hotter than lava rocks
You don’t know what time it is
Then go out and cop a watch
When drama pops, we fade niggas out like a barber shop
Y’all talk a lot, we stomp pimps out in the parking lot
Step on my block—that’s a mistake like when the condom pop
You got to stop before you get shot like Big and Pac
Two shots to your arm and your crouch
We bombin’ your spot, we got it on lock
Please believe I got the heat up the sleeve
So sick, I’m a living breathing disease, a hedonist sleaze
Who wants a piece of the cheese
When I creep through the trees like Vietnamese
Reach for the breeze before I lift your feet off the leaves
Now you eager to leave—get back in your seat
While your lady feelin’ on my meat like a catholic priest
Like L.L. in the back of the jeep
We swinging episodes, the Tech’ll blow, your neck explodes
Now you got extra holes aside from your ears, mouth, and your nose
A fully composed masterpiece—I was fully exposed
To the altered beast in my heart
I’m sick in the head
Don’t become the quick of the dead
I got a six-shot revolver lodged in my esophagus with one bullet
Eight-millions stories in this world untold
So in my notebook is where I put ‘em
You just a Jr. like Cuba Gooding

[Verse 2 – I-See-On]
I’s insane in the brain and I might just kill a man like Cypress Hill
Throw him off the cliff with his head shaved
My chest caged, smokin’ C.I. backwoods
Type to walk through black hoods—black hood, black gun
Magnum big enough to pistol whip you
I sit and beat you into submission until both of your eyes are missin’
Knock your teeth out, give you gashes over your face
While the beatdown still pending like an open case
Y’all’ll take me to court—that’s how y’all do things
When I beat you down, you’ll scream out “Su” like Wu-Tang
Choke you with a belt, pull your pants over head
Range Rover both of your legs.  Oops, it’s over, you dead
Say goodbye now.  Niggas gettin’ wiped out
And I ain’t gonna stop ‘til there’s blood all over the White House
Tell George Bush to call Bill Clinton
And have him call Monica Lewinski ‘cause the boy is spittin’
I’m sick with it.  They got me watchin’ my rear view
I’m looking for steel to stomp him with steel shoes
When I was born, they put me inside my grave first
I’m lookin’ for God in the Garden of Eden he made first
I found the serpent and choked his ass so fast it reversed the process of Earth—birth to the first Earth
I’m Pearl Harbor to the third power.  I’m like the Japanese
The way I’m clappin’ when I’m packin’ heat
I’m like the summer when you feel the heat
I’m like bullets from Pakistanis—that’s word to my baby mami
I spit sicker, malt liquor verse
I got it wrapped like turbans—watch how I swerve to the left
Bin Laden bullets burst in your chest
Big guns, big bombs, big bullets, AK and a vest, nigga

[Verse 3 - Block McCloud]
What?  What you thought?  I forgot how to spit?
Spit hot shit that stick like the top of my dick
Walk when I talk so my words are stalkin’
My thoughts, things, pluck your veins like guitar strings
Harborin’ a criminal’s thought like a priest in a pew
Listening to children whisperin’ in the dark
Scissor the heart—if you’re smart, you’ll swim with the sharks
Envision this block locked like where the prisoner watch
So in a battle, you doubt I’mma win—you goin’ out on a limb
Snake’ll have you jumpin’ out of your skin’
I’m sick like multiple sclerosis
Cult’ll kill your closet kin—sins can only be found through hypnosis
You got to crack the skull to pull out all the multiple personalities—it’s comp’rable to what I’ve done to you
I’ll come for you to sculpture you with scalpels.  What do you prefer to lose?
Your genitals or two-thirds of your purple ooze?
I murder crews with surgical tools and drill bits
So when they ask what I did to this shit, “He killed it.”

[Verse 4 – Immortal Technique]
If you ever try to floss on me up in the cypher
Your platinum will fall apart like it’s made of Formica
You think you’re nice but I’m nicer
Like Ras Kass, Punisher, and KRS in a gene splicer
Fuck a Bentley—I’ll run you down in a Chrysler
My shit is raw like cocaine stuffed in a diaper
I shared cells with lifers when I was stuck in prison
Smokin’ Buddha like I was burning someone else’s religion
I lift my leg to urinate on conservative Christians
‘Cause you never seen a dog hold his dick while he’s pissin’
Listen instead of bitchin’ at the shit that I’m rippin’
‘Cause intellectual, murderous, spittin’ this copywritten
You can’t compare what you’re kickin’ to what I verbally did
I’m the Lord of the Flies, nigga, ‘cause I’m murderin’ kids
Run up in your crib without a fuckin’ camera crew
And confiscate your plaques for doing things that amateurs do
Sabotage, break down the industry, damagin’ you
A runaway slave—that’s how my stamina grew
I come through walkin’ on water like the messiah
I make bitches lose they mind like Mariah
I set tracks on fire like Betty Shabazz
And when I fuck, I burn rubber like Dominican cabs
Iron-clad armor, spit like a sub-machine
And burn your block to ashes like nuclear submarines

Ayo, bitch, put your finger in your ear.  It’s squishy in there, right?  That’s ‘cause I just raped your fuckin’ brain

[Verse 5 – Mr. Metaphor]
I’ll spit a five-star motion picture—let’s skip the previews
We throwin’ razor blades, y’all put to teaspoons
Get to know me.  I’m your girl’s tenderoni
I’m the man in the whip with the place in the back, blinkin’ “Members Only”
And we ain’t takin’ applications
We the team that got the fastest break to five championships without a talent agent
I be on the real—I beat on your skill
I’ll kill your lawyer and I’ll pee on your deal
And I ain’t tryna be funny, I’m just tryna see money
Add to the game and keep the economy running
I’m going anywhere life takes me ‘cause there’s gotta be something
And by the time I’m out the game, see, there’ll be probably be nothing
I’m tryna move to the left and keep y’all in the middle
I got the butter handle—y’all always double dribble
Y’all been suckers way back since your mother’s nipple
I double-dare you to step if trouble hit you
Y’all got it backwards like pussy, so wise up
People look too hard and get their eyes stuck
I swing my dick in the air ‘cause I’m that fly fuck
Live, about to erupt, better slide up!
We keep it hard—y’all have step or stay or Dante
Y’all better get the fuck up like Pharaohe Monch say
And put your hands where my eyes can see
I’m MJ on the mic, so come fly with me
It’s Mr. Meta, do the math.  7 minus 3
That cat breakin’ out the church with the bride-to-be
One week later, she cooking me broccoli
Two weeks later, her cousin’s on top of me
Three weeks later, I’m up in her family
With the keys to the crib and the Cam-ery
I plan to see the world in the outer limits
Without no gimmicks, it’s Met now.  Out my business!This is Immortal Technique
Harlem, New York
All over the world
And this is The Martyr
If you are listening to this
It is your responsibility
To burn this for every single motherfucker you know[Verse 1]
They say the odds against me, are crooked and impossible
Like I was born with a hole in my heart is an obstacle
I was left to die by the doctors, in the Children's Hospital
But I never lose hope, success is psychological
The world is volatile and the street is my education
Shaping the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So I'm focused on my economic situation
I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggas drop science but they don't know the math
Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
It's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
But never raise the gun and cry out "Freedom at last"
The cold war is over but the world is still getting colder
Atlas walking through the projects with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then the general, would decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personality split
Like the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips
They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce
Like Yeshua ben Yusef flipping through Genesis
Ignorance is venomous, and it murders the soul
Spreading like a virus running rampant, but out of control

[Hook]
So if I should ever fall and get caught in a hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray painting on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else

[Verse 2]
Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle
Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffing cracks in a duffle
Upstate behind steel gates attacked in a scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils, hacked to your muscle
But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And its the lawyers, not the inmates scheming to fuck you
Trying to fight the system from inside, eventually corrupts you
But that's what you get when you put a corporation above you
And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die you find yourself cursing their ghost
But you make success, nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take, since prehistoric vertebrates
Crawled out of the lakes, and that's the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice
Because even though we survived through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
But I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
And semi-automatic barrages, that empty the cartridge
Post-traumatically scar kids that try to be brave
Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility; addicted to greed
Beating their girls purposefully losing a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive

[Hook]

I used to wonder (I used to wonder) about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way that they portrayed us to everyone else
That cursed us, then only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurting ourselves

I used to wonder (I used to wonder) about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way that they portrayed us to everyone else
That cursed us, then only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurting ourselves

I used to wonder {*echo*}[MC Caness]
I stay a mile high like Denver
So I say, I better spit a chorus with a style I'll remember
So when you're spittin' it starts gettin' wild in the center
Rippin' it gifted like a Christian child in December
And gettin' it lifted like when I'm eatin' out blunt lips
You gettin' it twisted by speakin' 'bout dumb shit
Your young ship, I run shit from drum kicks to tongue flips
With Parallel Thought, it's much deeper than a cunt gets

[Wordsworth]
Choruses connect in my verses, raise the curtain
The crowd in unison has us connecting in person
Views so you know the titles of my songs vibe and sing along
What they ask for when you buy it in the stores
Without a hook you would OD from my bar supply
You need a break before your brain and your heart subsides
Give you a chance to turn it off or listen to the rest of it
Show you that I'm beyond and for y'all it's best to quit

[Karniege]
This is a great song stupid
Eight bar brutal when I cook you a hook that'll shake y'all noodle
Like hockey writers, smackin' a poodle
Put your hands up, that'll make 'em get cookoo
Straight jacket racket, kids unusual
Karniege swing buildings, "Yo where Brookey go?"
To another time zone, C-3PO
Funky like B.O., BB just ease yo

[Double AB]
These A&R's appall us, like "Nice verse but we want a chorus
Then you'll be larger than a dinosaur is."
So fuck a Brontosaurus, cause the shit I drop off the top enormous
Yo my shit is hot, get your fire insurance
They ask Double AB for catchy hooks
But all I rap about is Gangsta Bitches, that's the joint Apache took
So when they ask for hooks, this is what AB will do
Hook you up to feeding tubes, that's what you'll be eating through

[Interlude]
I'll tell you what kid. You'll never fuckin' be good enough. You'll never be good enough to sing in this fuckin' town, I'll tell you that. You'll never make Chorus Line. You ain't no Wonder Woman

[Tame One]
Trife I live it and give it all
With chickens for lickin' my balls and shaft, if not they haulin' ass
On blast cause even with no check
I gets low neck from chicks in projects with no sweat
Cause the heat's off, no threat
Here, here's my cell, you can yell at who you go get, tell 'em "get at me"
Let's be diplomatic, I'm [?]
Like Jim Jones, I've been grown
Since the only thing for me to fall back on is my ass
I'mma sing songs for cash on flask long as it last
Dead ass

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Yo
Haters don't like us, we write this for 25 to lifers
In Rikkers and Harley Davidson riders and bikers
We Warriors, can you dig it like Cyrus? It's like a jungle sometimes
Lions and tigers want to ignite us and light us on fires
No cost, no platinum cards
Relaxing, back massage, ghetto ass rap stars
In the club flossin', I'm broke actin' large
Smooth secret garden, I'm the pale El DeBarge
Sho' yo' right

[C-Rayz Walz]
What you need to catch fish with
The Candyman's weapon of choice
Peter Pan's arch nemesis is this shit
Just don't let me connect one to your cheek
Cause if I do
You will tongue kiss your teeth for a week
Kareem Abu Jab y'all
I stay hittin'
Low dunks
But if the beats bangin', they'll listen
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
(Why?)
I am the hook

[Thirstin' Howl III)
The hook
With the line to follow
The real, the beaches define the model
Money, hoes, clothes still do them all
On the magazine cover of "Dude Was Poor"
Polo king
Oh yeah mayne
I'm the Goya bean
Still takin' all ya bling

[C-Rayz Walz]
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
I am the hook

[Klu Sheisty]
I am the hook, but that's just the half of me
I'm a walkin' weed spot you should ask for me
Got The Hook-Up like Master P, passin' trees
Guaranteed you'll be hooked from a blast of these
I'm a real dirty hook, stop actin' sweet
I hang dead cows up, don't ask for beef
I'm a real grimy hook to a nasty beat
I'm a real hot cook cause the rap's is heat

[C-Rayz]
Just don't let me direct one to your cheek
Cause if I connect
You'll tongue kiss your teeth for a week

[Sean Price]
Yo
Hook rap
Pirates, pot poets cook crack
You look wack
Hurricane game, sneakers on, fuck is wrong with ya?
Sean is a killer
Sean a gorilla
Ape in a tree
'Bout to scrape your date off some E
Back flippin', gats spittin'
Sell crack rappin' dude
Back smack a few rappers who rap with an attitude
Sixteen bars, bring in the hook
Sixteen scars, y'all niggas is shook
Who called police?

[Swave Sevah]
Ayo, fuck how many bars it take
I'mma keep spittin' rapid fire darts till the target break
I'm gon' be direct and get my point across in 8
Spit 16 out of this world if you lost in space
24 make you walk off with your chin in your chest
32 end your career, put your spirit to rest
This niggas a threat, just give me a track let it cook
I stop when I'm ready, I don't give a fuck about a hook

[Poison Pen]
Watch out for the hook, jeah
Eight bars, four bars, two bars
Most of y'all flakes is fubar
Niggas with no bars abuse 'em
Most of the rappers in Texas don't use 'em
Stupid
Right hook homie, bust up your shit
The wrong hook homie will bust up your wrist
Clutch up your fist
Don't fight with me
Get hit with so many hooks y'all should pay me ghost writing fees

[C-Rayz Walz]
What you need to catch fish with
The Candyman's weapon of choice
Peter Pan's arch nemesis is this shit
Just don't let me connect one to your cheek
Cause if I do
You'll tongue kiss your teeth for a week
Kareem Abu Jab y'all
I stay hittin'
Low dunks
But if the beats bangin', they'll listen
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
(Why)
I am the hook

[Thirstin Howl III]
Hook
Like prostitution
Pussy free everywhere is the top solution
New York slang, choose your gang
Still in all do ya thang
White bitches show me love before Jeezy knew what snow was
Hook
Longer than methadone clinic lines
Did it fine, didn't mind with pigeon primes

[C-Rayz Walz]
My style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
I am the hook

[Immortal Technique]
Fuck a chorus
Straight cancer like Phillip Morris
Burning like magnesium phosphorus
Top of the food chain, tyrannosaurus
It's saber tooth, bloody truth
Ripped from under my tongue in the booth
Psychotic youth
Fucked in the mind
Monkey wrenching their own plans, stuck in they grind
A sign of the times
A forthright flooded with neo-nazis
And haunted by the souls of murdered Iraqis
No chorus can stop me
Motherfuck 'em

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Hahaha. Fuck a chorus nigga. Stronghold. Immortal Technique. C-Rayz Walz. Uh. Like that. Hahahaha[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
I’m at the drug lab trying to figure out my next move
I’ve gotta make this raw street hop break through
This criminology rap that slash fake crews
Like insanity that make front page news
I’m the head trauma that makes your scarface bruise
MCs nowadays lose with bars they use
There’s a war between Heaven and Hell
Which do you choose
No matter what side homes, you gotta pay dues
My central intelligence was birthed in my residence
Downtown tenements were grim and no elements man
I live my life while the wicked try ending it
My brain’s more fucked up than joints with a stem in it
Your weak shit I’m deading it, all for the cause
I’ll be crucifying your lies live on a Jesus cross
We hold our own court when truth is the judge
I got hollow jurors that give out guilty verdicts in blood

[Refrain x2: Cynic]
These words that I live by
One day I might die by
Make my mom cry
Will this shit get worse for me
The CIA murder me
For talking in third degree in a state of emergency

[Verse 2: Cynic]
Still make the world panic
More than gang faggots lead masses
Go beyond banging, fuck religion
Meditate with the poised
I’m ramming horns with the Jewish
I’m talking ? moves than speak agnostic when I walk through Jerusalem
Cleanse you, come and swell out your Lakota-Sioux
We’ve been through the stars
Seen the birds named Jesus
His ink clues write truth aimed to wake the youth
Before they waste their talent end up locking a shoot
C’mon, I’m culminating when I’m in the meridian
Illumination, fuck being an idiot
A master mason when I’m building my pyramid
Medicine man blowing up the schools of Americans
I’ll let you go tell a friend
Determination to leave my fam
In war to cross dope we kill a minuteman
I’m living paranoid
I think it’s the end
July tenth the Earth wept when I took my first breath

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Chace Infinte]
We dealing with a system designed
To confuse niggas minds
And it’s worse when the people divide
Fighting titans, ruling the Earth’s tyrants
Evil alliance trying to blind us and changing the ancient god sciences
Instead of taking knowledge and applying it
The devils reversed the knowledge and gave us the spell of leviathan
God became dark, meaning a dark star
Represented by Anubis am I losing y’all
Hope y’all ready for war
I be busting
To the trumpets blow to signify the end for us all
With a tent, a canteen and a chrome .44
Not dealing with man’s rituals but with God’s laws
And I know I’m on the list for the things that I spit
The government act as if the artists are terrorists
They terribly pissed because the kids listen to this
And get influenced by the music so they can’t tell em shit
This is rebel music
Nigga raise your fist
The words that I speak
A nigga live and die by this
I’m just a poet with an ancient soul
A master teacher that knows how to break down and speak in codes

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]
Far from pitiful my young mind harboured a criminal
Like the spirit of a nigga you murdered that lives with you
It's complicated
I'm obligated
Were confiscated to conquer hatred
And replace it in the people I'm faced with
Prison Planet fanatics complain to the Matrix
While we facing life in prison in the prism inside the Matrix
We like Texas instruments, programmed to be basic
Cause the mother land was victim to a cultural rapist
So it murdered for political freedoms
The evidence
Look in the Bible
Wasn't Moses a terrorist
And he was one of the greatest
Prophets that ever lived
That showed freedom is not something enemies ever get
So what if I could make the Mississippi run red
And the angel of death left every first born American dead
Would God's messenger be like the Unabomber
Or Americas karma that'll rip through your body armor[Intro]
Like anybody, I would like to live — a long life; longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at, it always follows you where you are
And it's hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But it's harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically running from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South: I respect their vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of America's vision
They want us dancing, cooning and hollering
Only respect us for playing sports and modeling
More than racism: it's stay in your place-ism
More people are trapped in practical blackface-ism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
It's between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house

[Hook: Chuck D]
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowing the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization

Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Trying to survive cultural assassination

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Crip niggas, Blood niggas, eses, Asians
Why the fuck we warring with each other's population?
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation, why the separation?
Why we got Jamaicans hating on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations?
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other, straight hating
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom, be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness of what I'm saying
You gotta recognize another G ain't the enemy
When the police ride, they kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G, then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets, we should really end war

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
Our hearts were torn apart just like y'all was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Everytime we called your office you ignored us
Now you holding hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us, ask if we're jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best: Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence, you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only pure when they're applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Heard you need putting fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qu'rans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you? Civil war
