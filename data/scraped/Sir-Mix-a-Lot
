[Intro - white girls]
Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt
It is so big. She looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, y'know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like
Out there, I mean - gross. Look!
She's just so ... black!

[Verse 1]
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them dancing
The hell with romancing
She's wet, wet
Got it going like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(LA face with the Oakland booty)

[Hook]
Baby got back!

[Verse 2]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwing a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm acting like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talking about Playboy
Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Begging for a piece of that bubble
So I'm looking at rock videos
Watching these bimbos walking like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it going on
A lot of simps won't like this song
Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes {Yeah!}
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Hook]

Yeah, baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection... 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"

[Verse 3]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playing workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that "hard" role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' about stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back![Verse 1]
Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

[Hook]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 2]
Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, "Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's"
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset
She's with the Mix-a-Lot posse on the Broadway setArtist: Sir Mix-a-Lot
Album: Seminar
Song: My Hooptie

My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin'
Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin'
Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin' tabs expired
Girlies tryin' to dis 'n say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket, cause my Benz is in the shop

My hooptie - my hooptie

Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep

Cars barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared, so I got on
Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong
Posse moved north, headin for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
I pot-hole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother cause I'm plowin' over suckers

In a hooptie

It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned
(Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a u-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brother start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets
I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-C-O
Military, competition. You know
I ain't really fazed, cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough, cause I got much fame
"How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot"
"Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock"
Ooooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing
Runnin' that game with the home made slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped

By a hooptie

Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot
"Whatcha want me to do Mix?"
Push freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hard core brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nuthin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said "Damn, they all look like Tyson"
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go
This bucket ain't rollin' in snow

It's my hooptieOperator's voice:

(Message sent)Now I'm your big maul dropper, mud duck stopper
Fila on the bottom and Adidas on the topper
Transform scratching, big beat matching
I can tell you're getting jealous by the look I'm catching
I hate dumb skeezers, MC beater
Dropped 5 grand on my Bird watt meter
Smooth like ice, don't get nice
Just turn up the box for the Mix-A-Lot slice (huh huh)

Y'all ready to get busy? (huh huh!)
Now, buttermilk biscuits here we go
Sift the flour roll the dough
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move your butt to the funky beat (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
(Lord have mercy Mix-A-Lot's got me rapping about biscuits now)

Freak from L.A. to the Carolinas
Dip them suckers in Aunt Jemima
Don't make a difference what food you make
Use buttermilk biscuits to clean your plate
You eat 'em in the morn', you eat 'em at night
Kentucky Fried Chicken makes the suckers just right
I am eat 'em with jelly at my favorite deli
Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)

One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, looking real swass
All the girls smile cause I'm the big boss
Said I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
"Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!"
So what you waiting on boy?  Get up shake a leg
Gimme ten of them suckers with grits and eggs
Glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a super fast cutter (huh huh)

Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker 'til the dough expand
Put them suckers off in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a dab of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
Kind of get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (huh huh)Ho, Ho, Ho
(I know I ain't hear somebody say

[Verse 1]
Got 'em up, yeah my Taliano, not many brothers is rollin in Diablos
Hittin the hard rock, to finish my work spot
I'm lookin for females to cop (yeah)
You thinkin past me, I'm rollin up a five point O like pimps on ho, G
And I'm sittin in third, I'm never on swerve, to the right I merge
Now I'm patrollin and I'm lookin for a skirt, this thing I'm holin
I still got game ain't a damn thing change
I spot ten V's in the left lane
Eye contact is on, I'm rollin down windows pointin at thongs
And she's poppin them buttons and yankin that blouse
Girl let it all out!
And that's what she did, baby ain't no kid
36 D's a make a man skid
I'm puttin in work on the freeway pass
Cause she put 'em on the glass (yeah)

[Break] - w/ ad libs
Put 'em on the glass ..
Put 'em on the glass, girl
Put 'em on the glass

[Verse 2]
Yes he's kinky, weenie and jinky
Got fresh rock on his pinkie
He gets paid to stay laid
My copycats fade, evade to unpaid who's stay played
Girls when I'm on the freeway
Cats jumpin in, givin me leeway
And then drop them things on the dash
This Porsche is quick so don't try to run fast
At speed I got a need to see you breathe
And proceed with the kinky tease
Indecent exposure can't hold ya, it's makin you bolder
Cause baby is a Mix-A-Lot soldier
But lusting is on balls
Everybody's beggin to get into your draws
What's makin you hit brown?
+Baby Got Back+ or (shake it up and down)
You can follow me home cause this bone is on full blown
Straight growin all night long
I like my females nasty
Never try to drive straight past me
Just get in the left lane and show me your insane
And fill up the window with fangs
Puttin niggas on skids, jump out and straight crash
Cause she put 'em on the glass

[Break] - w/ ad libs - (*scratched*)

[Verse 3]
How many times will you play this
Before you ban this, I heard Mix so I can't stand this
But I got a family, lovin this scandalous rap
Guess who I got layin on the canvas
D-R R-I-C-H-A-R-D
Hard from the three way party
Baby them things is workin
Fillin up the passenger window with Jergens
You hit the gas I hit my drool
Baby can I get with you?
Rush the blood 'til the glass gets dressed
Obsessed with the ways you express yourself
Some say I only rap about wealth
But baby can I talk about your health?
Lungs, lungs, motherfuckin lungs
Get a brother oh so strung
I'm lovin this window draftin
The whole right lane is draftin
Offend me, offend me, you can freak me if your friendly
B double O B S, straight sittin in the window
I'd rather kiss them than indo
And if you see me on the freeway, baby don't pass
Slow down and put 'em on the glass

[Break] - w/ ad libs
Put 'em on the glass
Put 'em on the glass, girl
Put 'em on the glass
Now shake them titties ..
Shake 'em ..
Put 'em on the glass ..
Put 'em on the glassI'm rollin' in a Nine-Oh van
California, that's my plan
Got memories Mixalot left in limbo
First stop Sacremento
Here we go, hit a club called Bentleys
Want a skirt to git wit' me, hit me
There's a girl with a back like a Cadillac
I walked up and got pushed back
Her boyfriend tell her I'm a play-a
Dropped salt on a dope rhyme say-a
My reputation offends this man
Next day hit Williamland Park
Creepin' like a shark
Spot a bad freak and I swoop like a hawk
"What up?", "Howya like to roll wit' a champ?"
"Please! All ya'll rappers is tramps"
My reputation is stoppin' my mission
Every freak in Sac is dissin'
Back on the four lane freeway
Next stop, the two-one-three, L.A
The two-one-three is rough
But the Mixalot game is tough
Spot a young girl and I start that gamin'
Baby girl asks what set am I claimin'
"Just cuz I rap, I gotta be in gang?"
It ain't a black thang, it's a rap thang
Censorship is sweepin' the nation
Messin' up a rap stars reputation

A rappers reputation, that's what I got

So I'm finished with the two-one-three
I knock, baby, but it's time to leave
Two days on the hard rock, boys is cruisin'
Interstate Ten, straight to Houston
They tell me 'bout the girls in the fifth ward
You know the boys must score
So we hit a fly club called Guchies
Lookin' for the skirts with the largest booties
Girlies in the club wasn't takin' no shorts
Showin' no remorse
For a brother like Mix, lookin' for the smooth
Didn't need a Houston skirt to get with me
But the nights still young
And the hunk ain't done
So we stepped to the van
Attitude's out of it
The next club, The Main Event
We never think about a dress code
Just step up in the club and let the game roll
But as soon as my boy Maharaji pulls up
Some punk starts runnin' up
He said you don't wanna be with a rap star
They play you for your money and your car
Well my boy got crushed but the girl stepped off
With a rap stars rep, the girls are lost
"Hey yo, what's up, this is Mix I had to make a run
Right quick, but leave your name and number 'n I'll
Getcha right back, peace."

So the posse left Houston Texas
All the girls keep callin' us sexist
Houston media is givin' us rappers no pity
So we all hit Kansas City
In K.C. we go The Gates and Suns
Gotta get grub 'fore we run
Met a little freak named Stacy
I said I'm not just here for the Barbecue baby
She gave me that look, like Pebbles
I'm acked with bass not treble
So I say, Oogley-goo oogley-doo-goo-doo
"What'd you say?" I ain't tellin' you
You see the Mix game is laced with riddles
It ain't moaney, it's Mix in the middle
In walked my ex named Wendy
She got a fresh Dooney Bag
Cause she's tired of Fendi
Oooh, could a brother be busted
Because Wendy trusted, Me?
An' ah told a lit'l lie 'n
Said I was a loyal guy
Wendy got mad and she wants to dis me
In Kansas City
Wendy starts to groovin'
Hands on her hips and her hair starts movin'
She said the Mixalot game is phony
Just cause I said I'm runnin' girls like ponies
But talkin' that stuff is my occupation
That's how I got this reputation

A rappers reputation, got a rappers reputation
Bring it on down. A rappers reputation, bring it back
A rappers reputation, that's what I got. A rappers
Reputation, peace[Intro - white girls]
Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt
It is so big. She looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, y'know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like
Out there, I mean - gross. Look!
She's just so ... black!

[Verse 1]
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them dancing
The hell with romancing
She's wet, wet
Got it going like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(LA face with the Oakland booty)

[Hook]
Baby got back!

[Verse 2]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwing a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm acting like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talking about Playboy
Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Begging for a piece of that bubble
So I'm looking at rock videos
Watching these bimbos walking like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it going on
A lot of simps won't like this song
Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! {Yeah!} Ladies! {Yeah}
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes {Yeah!}
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Hook]

Yeah, baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection... 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"

[Verse 3]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playing workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that "hard" role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' about stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back!Operator's voice:

We like a great big Johnson - 4X

[Verse 1]
Big momma please don't give me drama 'bout my love hummer
If you ain't pleased, then tell me what I need
If you lie, I'll play the naive guy
 Tell me ten strong, you got a closer look
I know I ain't ten long, but that's okay
You call me Big Daddy anyway
And make me feel good 'bout my medium wood
She got her eyes closed, rockin me well
Tryin hard to get a nut, while she callin me Denzel
But oh well, get it Halle Berry, get it Halle Berry, get it
Two can play the games in a fantasy thing
And only five percent of men got nine and up
But eighty-five percent say they can't fit a cup, now what up?
Somebody gotta be lyin, cause I am
Claimin bout twelve on the hit-me scale
But the truth is the six to eight range, you hang
Just like the average Joe Plain, fool

Now every entertainer claims hung but not wanted
Mister Being-less-than-a-female's-best
But have you seen a John Holmes movie?
Got the double digit wide with a pack of porno groupies!
Well my girl did, she stayed glued to dude
He swingin fourteen inches and the remote she clenches
But she's my Misses but she's his tonight
And did I tell you John Holmes was white?
Uh oh, we can't let the urban legends die
Cause I be Mandingo and he be the gringo
It ain't supposed to go like this, it was goin well
Eight was swell, but fourteen brings hell
But I can't compete with this feat, so must I eat
The ultimate burger, I clicked on a cursor
Triple W dot Ginseng dot com
Tryna drop bombs, lay it down and hit in like John

You can blame it on the Internet, its too much access
To big studs lookin for quick love and hugs
They used to only have magazines with a three inch punk in a centerfold
His pee-pee's cold
But oh no my ego shrunk, when they got hunks
Big J Peg, beef strapped to his leg
No strings attached to the ride
Plus they only touch with they feminine side, so why try
But I bought tools from the tools store
I heard the revolutions per minute, can make up for dippin in it
Ain't no shame in my game, you could make to claim
You say your layin the pipe, but pay attention to your wife
Lover man ..
Come home from work and John Holmes be sittin up in your thing about fourteen inches deep
And you standin in the doorway lookin at three and a half (*laughing*)

Sir Mix-A-Lot: Damn girl, you meant that shit[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Here's a gory kind a story about a obese freak
With a 40-inch waist and a 10-inch beak
Overweight and out of shape with a triple chin
Her brassiere strikes fear in the hearts of men

The girl's a Bremelo
The girl's a Bremelo

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Me and Terry hopped the ferry we were lookin swass
When a dip hit the ship we were almost tossed
It was a big Bremelo standin on my toe
An enormous jelly belly tryin to say hello
I was really kinda frightened as she looked my way
I tried to run because her buns made the ferry sway
To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat
All the way to Bremerton were the fat is at

The girl's a Bremelo
Let's go

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
I'm not fakin' or mistaken bout the big ole duck
She had hairy underarms and a whopping gut
Her hair was short and wavy, drove my pitbull crazy
A Bremerton beast chasin fellas in the Navy
After movie she's the feature, the Bremerton creature
You wear a lifejacket if you ever try to freak her
Look at her physique she ain't my kinda freak
The floor creaks when the beast starts reachin her peak

[Break - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
The girl's a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo
Change the beat!
(*beat changes, then changes back to the original*)

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
You can't ignore the way she snores, cause she blows down doors
Baby's got the kind a face only a mother adores
A big basketball head with a 10-inch beak
Big lips, no hips with the smell of a beast
I couldn't put her in my Caddy or my tranny would break
I heard of dirt because of poverty, but she took my cake
When it comes to Kool-Aid the girl would drink it in pints
You go to school for twenty years and your still in the ninth?

You're just a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
You pink triple-chin unattractive duck
Your boyfriend beats freaks up to make a buck
Hangin round 3rd and Pike, on a ten-speed bike
You can say that I'm a liar, but you know I'm right
You talk behind my back, because I dropped you flat
And you never take a shower cause your too damn fat
So your man was smart when he broke your heart
Because if Mix-A-Lot a cut ya, you a fell apart
Wearin polyester slacks, with elastic in the back
You could flatten Schwarzenegger in a wrestling match
You got lips like a character in some cartoon
With a pink posterior, you big baboon

Your just a (*sound of a elephant yelling*)
(*sound of elephant yelling*)

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Now Bremerton's a city right outside of mine
Most girls there are ducks, but a few are fine
But the ones that I speak about
Used their face for catchin trout
Vacuum cleaners for a mouth
You know what I'm talkin about
Mud ducks, hockey pucks, drivers of Mack trucks
Lame brains, diesel trains, pick 'em up you have to strain
Big butt, crew cut, extraordinary gut
Big momma, kinda buff, facial hairs a kinda rough

[Outro - Sir Mix-A-Lot - talking]
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
Girl's a Bremelo
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
(*pig grunting noises are mixed in with word "duck"*)
The girl's a Bremelo
"duck" - repeated until fade[Tell em bout me baby]

Sweet Brown Shuga, that's what I call this female
Bad from the hair to the muthafuckin toenails
I ain't sprung, I'm just pumpin them facts
Baby is a female mack, yeah (hmmm)
???I said heel when the locs are peeled???
Takin yo money if your game ain't real
Known to keep the ass on proper (proper)
Never gettin tickets from the horny ass coppers
There she go, walkin through the mall
4" pumps, got her six feet tall
Switchin, I ain't thinkin bout stickin
Lookin like she never seen a kitchen
Just broke up with her boyfriend (boyfriend)
Lookin for a fool with the gripper ends (gripper ends)
Met one, boom, there he is
A rich young brother in showbiz, yeah
Big man, CEO, six-double-o are the letters on his Benzo
Big mack daddy, bad to the bone
But three months later it's on
He done took her to the beach, rubbed her feet
And brought baby girl a new jeep
Now she's gone, you can't buy love without game
The Shuga gotcha, lame!

Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell em bout me baby]

She's comin straight outta Encino
Hittin football players for the C-notes (yep)
Pickin em, gettin em, rarely ever kissin em
Takin for the bank and then quittin em
Went to the Raiders game in spite of this
Black quarterback with a big fat contract
Now she's on the visitors' sideline
The mackin is on when the coach calls "Time"
Quick work, gotta do a slip so
Do it while the Raiders is kickin they field goal
Put the number on the bottom of a cup
["The kick is up, (appalause) it's good!"]
Later that night, relaxin
The quarterback's thinkin he's waxin
But naw, the typical line:
[Girl] "I just don't think it's the right time" ["wha?"]
Ask yourself, who's the mack?
Baby starts buyin money sacks
Cause when the fool got to the next city
Western Union Street got busy
Four Gs a week and now baby got a condo sittin in Redondo
So the quarterback calls cause he wanna get naked
[Boop bup beep] Disconnected!
I'll tell ya, son, just because you can bench-press
Don't put ya past this test
You got pimped like a straight up sap
Paid money cause you're sprung on the cat
Huh! Bout 35 Gs and now you're through
Never got near the boots
See ya, but I never woulda been ya
Sweet Brown Shuga done went up in ya!

[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga!
[Tell-tell em bout me baby]

Baby starts goin to the weight room, that's trouble
Addin more curve to the bubble
The rump is pumped, ready for battle
Caught the next plane to Seattle
Welcome to the 206
She's lookin for the brother named Mix
Jumped in a rental car, rolled to the hood
Brown Shuga's up to no good
Got my digits, gave me a call
Have no fear, Mix-a-Lot don't fall
*phone rings on the other line* "Yeah who dis?"
[Girl] "38-24-38, Mix"
Clipped on my pager, grabbed my cellular
Eeny meeny miny mo and picked the number 8 car
Now I'm rollin in my NSX
Thinkin I'mma get some ]COO-CHIE[
Met her at the Minimart, she was in the Escort
I'm kinda thinkin bout contact sports
When we get back to the Mix house
I'm knockin that kitty cat OUUUUT!

[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga
[Tell em bout me baby] Sweet Brown Shuga
[Tell em bout me baby] That's what I call this female!
[Tell em bout me baby]
[Tell em bout me baby]Now I'm your big maul dropper, mud duck stopper
Fila on the bottom and Adidas on the topper
Transform scratching, big beat matching
I can tell you're getting jealous by the look I'm catching
I hate dumb skeezers, MC beater
Dropped 5 grand on my Bird watt meter
Smooth like ice, don't get nice
Just turn up the box for the Mix-A-Lot slice (huh huh)

Y'all ready to get busy? (huh huh!)
Now, buttermilk biscuits here we go
Sift the flour roll the dough
Clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move your butt to the funky beat (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)
(Lord have mercy Mix-A-Lot's got me rapping about biscuits now)

Freak from L.A. to the Carolinas
Dip them suckers in Aunt Jemima
Don't make a difference what food you make
Use buttermilk biscuits to clean your plate
You eat 'em in the morn', you eat 'em at night
Kentucky Fried Chicken makes the suckers just right
I am eat 'em with jelly at my favorite deli
Wrapped and sealed by a freak named Shelley (huh huh)

Buttermilk biscuits (x 3)

One day I kissed my freak, hit the street
Looking for something to eat
In a 18-wheeler, looking real swass
All the girls smile cause I'm the big boss
Said I gotta eat now, can't eat later
Made a lot of noise to attract my waiter
The boy walked up, and what did he say?
"Say, buttermilk biscuits free today!"
So what you waiting on boy?  Get up shake a leg
Gimme ten of them suckers with grits and eggs
Glass of Koolaid and a whole stick of butter
Them biscuits make me a super fast cutter (huh huh)

Now grab that can and wrap it in your hand
Bang that sucker 'til the dough expand
Put them suckers off in your oven
Grab your girlie and get a little lovin'
Add a dab of honey if you want to get funny
Microwave the suckers if you want your honey runny
Kind of get naughty at the Mix-A-Lot party
And rub them suckers all over your body (huh huh)They call me Mister Lamborghini

Controversy made them ban me, understand me
Girls, bringin many problems to my world
Tryin to make Mix pay for them pearls
One had a baby and it's a girl *baby giggling*
I swore I had protection, got an erection
Must resist temptation
Girls flock, ride my jock
Cause a big fat Porsche went around the block (mmm)
Met a young girl named Angel
She had a big long weave I'd love to mangle
So I'm puttin in work, lovin tight skirts
So you know a mack poppa gotta flirt (woo!)
Room triple deuced me and baby got loose
Look at baby wiggle that big caboose
Got a little tiny waist, everything's in place
I'm pacin, facin the situation
It's on, put it on tape, troop
Got a little sex now I'm sittin on a lawsuit
Nine months later, little baby pops out
Blonde hair, blue eyes, with her feets in her mouth
Well that can't be me (nope)
Cause I'm a nappy haired black man, dressed like a O.G
Angel's gold diggin, this girl's driven
Tryin to catch Mix on slippin

For the bank I've made

The next story, met a young skirt, said her name was Laurie
Smoked much dank, but her life was boring
Got with Mix, now she adores me
Nasty nigga named Mix (yep)
On a tour bus with the porno flicks (mm)
Anxious cause I wanna knock boots
And I don't sleep with the girls in my group
So Mack Daddy is strollin and patrollin
Big fat bank I'm holdin
Bus pulls up to the mini mart
And that's where Laurie works and my game starts
Laurie knows nothin bout rap though
And that peeled my superstar cap, so
I'll just go back to the basics
And even that game is stiff, baby, face it
So now Laurie and me is headed to the ?monkey dope?
Straight gettin to the ?monkey poke?
Dip dip dip, one two three
*she moans* Cause I'm a vet'ran, see
I kissed her cheek while Laurie was asleep
Let one more groupie use me (mm)
One year later she's tryin to creep
ON MY MONEY
But I ain't the one to get played the sap (uh-uh)
When I hit the sack, big Richard is capped
Your man's a punk for leavin kids with you
The baby's cute, but don't call me Da Da!

I'm sittin, in Long Beach Cali, eatin Popeyes' chicken
Thinkin bout the next snake charmer I'm hittin
Met a fly skirt, nickname was Kitten
And I start spittin
WhassUP with the brother in the passenger seat?
Homeboy bailed cause his game was weak
And he was callin her bitch, I was callin her baby
He got the finger, I got the lady
Me and Kitten left the place quickened (yep)
Busta, you and cousin Kitten need a stickin
TO THE 'TEL, TO THE 'TEL, TO THE 'TEL WE RUSH
(gasp) The jimmy-hat bust
I start sweatin, conscience bettin
That I'mma have to deal with bed wettin
But I'mma handle this thing like a man
Settle down and bring the kid up, that's the plan
Three weeks later I get this call though
Kitten sounds happy on the telephone
She said "Go on and live your life, bro
Cause EPT said no," so don't call me Da Da!

[D-Da Da Da]

Don't call me Da Da!Men have died and shot folks for this game
All to get a rusty bucket of nails at the end of a platinum rainbow
No, game

[Hook]
Some have died and some just lied with it (game)
Some have cried and others tried to get it (game)
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old (this game won't ever get old)

I got no kids because of it (because the game)
And I got no wife because of it (because the game)
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old

[Verse 1]
East Lessler Way, Apartment D, see thee bad memories
Used to be the, one with no TV
Take back my soul, stole by one of these foes like Mack Moes
Puttin holes in my old clothes, even stole my pose
Got my sky, fly, who that guy?
Slip 'em my third eye, falsified
Don't lie, break with a girl, you cry
If you wants game, slip me some change
But you must refrain, from saltin my name
Now your girl's at my door, I told ya bro
Salt me, I take what's yours, that's the rules though
The big leagues, how can game go outta style
Boy you foul, slicin game with a mean ass scowl
Young stud ..

[Hook]
Some have died and some just lied with it (for the game)
Some have cried and others tried to get it (for the game)
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't ever get old

I got no kids because of it (kids because of it)
And I got no wife because of it (wife because of it)
But I got this life because of it (life because of it)
Told ya, game don't never get old

[Verse 2]
Seattle to Diego, big black El Dorados, my saddle
So straddle papa and babble until dada raddles
Let game resume, I assume using my room to boom boom
If not leave soon, let me retune
Big saloon, says "oh, oh, I'm so low"
My old enzo flows, hey two Diablos to go
But whoa, oh, but wait, oh
You can't be serious partner
You used to be scared of girls, now you smell like my imposter
I seen your chicky poster, fake pose, gun in holster
Your girl gets to me closer, tryna post up on the clothes-ac
You toast her, boast her, get you closer, gettin hitched up
Bitched up, whipped up, lost your strikes when you switched up
Husband ..

[Hook] - w/ ad libs
I got no kids because of it
And I got no wife because of it
But I got this life because of it
Told ya, game don't never get old

Some have died and some just lied with it
Some have cried and others tried to get it
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it
Told ya, game don't never get old

[Verse 3]
So who's next to go pop face lock on my mack spot
Heads drop when my cuts flop, don't stop please Mix, don't stop
I saw his game it ain't the same, so don't cry baby
Just sit by Mixxy, but dimed us cam D
So I stack my backpack (for the raps), going to Cali (comin back)
Tricks up my sleeve (look at that), sisters with me (who the mack)
I rolls with real bosses, cuts my losses in my office
Hot tosses, gettin steamy in these marinatin sauces
Now these young kids is in my gravy, hella lazy
But they paid see, doin things to raise me
They game's a little hazy, but it's cool
Pat, pack, rack your stack
He's back, put check your hat
And your style at the door black

[Break]
I got no kids because of it
And I got no wife because of it
But I got this life because of it

[Sir Mix-A-Lot - talking]
Yeah don't grab the game bull by the horns
Cause these horns hit balls, you know what I'm sayin?
Tears roll down your cheek and freeze
Before they reach concrete
Game's up, feelings gone
You graduate to stone

Some have died and some just lied with it
Some have cried and others tried to get it
Men have lied and lost their pride to get it

Gold around his neck (8 ball rollin)
Gold around his neck (24-7)
Gold around his neck (8 ball rollin)
Gold around his neck (14k heaven)

Clockin' lots of dollars, cruisin' in his benz
Clockin' lots of dollars, got no place to go
Clockin' lots of dollars, rollin' with your posse
Clockin' lots of dollars, we all got gold

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Listen up brothers it's the rhyme I can't repeat
I'm sportin' more gold than a rock n roll freak
Mix is my name, bustin' rhymes is my game
Don't disrespect me cause I kill then I take your chain
Life is pretty tough yet goes kinda rough
Stealin' and you're dealin' but you just can't get enough
Now you're crying cause my rope is 20 millimeters fat
You're stealin' gold emblems down at Fredrick Cadillac
Walkin' round San Fran, rippin' up the set
Homeboys on the corner ask us where we rock next
I'm not in town to smoke dope
If you broke you smoke dope
We're back in San Francisco and we're looking for the gold rope
Saw the rock man and we tailed his benz
He drove Powell Street to where the trolley cars end
He sipped his soda pop, came to a complete stop
Looked over to the left it was a... gold shop!


[Bridge]
Yo baby check out this big gold nugget ring!

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Walked into the shop and I had to stare
This freak was in the corner with the long blonde hair
I knocked her out the way cause she was standin' in my vision
I saw this gold rope and Maharashi started fishin'
Walked up to the counter and we hit the bell
We all had money for the big gold sale
From back behind the counter came the big gold mines
Last name, kinda funny, but his first name was Jahan
"Put your money down that's nothing to me
Got the real rock man buying my jewelry
So they got lots of money from american games"
The AMG kick on my 516 Mercedes
So I reached into my pocket and I pulled thick bank
I would have bought the store but my bank just sank
I know I got points cause my gold shines bright
Gonna sport it to the solar system Saturday night
Maharashi's up next for the big gold deal
Flipped dead presidents and cold got ill
Smile on his face with a grand in his hand
Bought a turkish gold rope with the 30 inch span
Kid Sensation was the next at bat
Bought a big nugget watch, face up a Cadillac
He saw this gold rope and said "How much for that to go?"
Told him 700 dollars everybody said "woooaaahhhh"
Security came over as the kid count bank
Gave him fourteen fifties and his face stayed blank
I grabbed the sack of gold and Jahan, we told em bye
We'd like to stay and kick it but we can't we gotta fly

[Break]
Break!

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
We left the gold shop kinda broke but happy
Promoter put us up in an '86 caddy
Crossed the Golden Gate and headed for the Napa Valley
No liter in the car because we threw it in the alley
Everybody's trippin' off the Mix-a-lot crew
Pose fresh dipped all filas are through
Caddy pushin 80 like a big black rocket
We're looking for a posse with no money in their pockets
We made a right turn theres the pose on the left
Before we get busy just remember we're def
Maharashi took the bank roll, Larry took the car
Kid Sensation had a plan thinking he was the star
Step aside kid I control this jam
You are my partner and here's my scam
I'll take the homeboys you take the skeezer
The boys got gold but they ain't got filas
Larry made a move with the black briefcase
5000 dollars worth of fila in your face
They ain't got money but they had a lot of dope
I said I don't want drugs just give me your rope
To sell a suitcase of filas boy it ain't no thing
Just give me that gold that includes all rings
Maharashi snatched the gold out the homegirls nose
Man we would have took her bra if the sucka was gold

Song:   Gortex

Posse in effect, scramble up, new rhyme
Big Goretex, crushed down, two time
Rumble in the street, neighborhood shakedown
Emerald City posse, gonna take this town
Suckers gettin' mad, swift kick, broke rib
Serve it in a dish, name it up, rib-tip
Metal in the front, big stomp, crush neck
Punks on tip, call the boots, GoreTex

Laugh if you want, but you might get crushed
Walk through the dangerous Hilltop brush
Bullet-proof, steel-toed, down to kick butt
Roughin' up character who drop weak cuts
One twenty five was the price tag on 'em
Cool brothers buy 'em, even though they don't want 'em
Style is a must, but the style is rough
China Beach boots couldn't crush more stuff
Strap 'em down, lace 'em up, get in the bucket
Reach for the tongue, pull it out, then tuck it
Ten pound boots could destruct all comers
My whole posse wears them Fort Lewis runners

Death to a white pair of nikes           - sound effect
Kickin' over big motor bikes             - sound effect
Steppin' over puddles in the hood        - sound effect
Girls laugh, but you know they look good - sound effect
Waffle-like prints in the snow           - sound effect
Pulverize punks when we throw            - sound effect
Salute to the group in the booths        - sound effect
Bow, and we kick you in the snoot        - GoreTex

Hollow-point nine, to the boots, ricochet
Leavin' mud prints when I romp in the rain
Draw black scars on the new gym floor
Pimps like to wear 'em when they kick them whores
This is it baby, big shiny black boots
Runnin' over punks like Iranian troops
Trample, crush, hittin' like a dump truck
Jump in my face and a size twelve get stuck
In your butt, cause you wanted to box
One-two punch and the GoreTex drops
On your toe, your brother got caught
By GoreTex boots from the GoreTex shop

Git it!

Posse in effect, scramble up, new rhyme
Big Goretex, crushed down, two time
Rumble in the street, neighborhood shakedown

Suckers gettin' mad, swift kick, broke rib
Serve it in a dish, name it up, rib-tip
Metal in the front, big stomp, crush neck
Punks on tip, call the boots, GoreTexI'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier

All you wannabe gangstas, drivin' Volkswagons
Chillin' at the high schools, broke but braggin'
Under educated, your style is dated
You talk behind my back and your rope's gold-plated
But I'm back to take revenge, my beef will never end
I'll tear your midsection, 'til your body start to bend
Like a pistol, I'm a smokin'
I'm crushin', not jokin'
Whippin' sissies for a past time, and no I'm never chokin'
I blow away suckers with the flicker of my index
Not brass monkey, it's a natural reflex
Go getter tactics, makin' suckers holla
A vicious motherfucker with a rope around my collar
I carry lots a cash, I whip a sucker's ass
I drive a big Caddy, and I pull the trigger fast
Down at Arnold's on the Ave, I fight 'til the death
I let you sock me in my chest, and then I break your damn neck
I got the cold beats rippin', your needle's not skippin'
So many damn weapons that the military's trippin'
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
But you rock heads wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier

Now let's get one thing straight, my weapons are great
You 22 automatic suckers are late
Got a quarter Moon clip, and a Smith and Wesson
I'm about to give you roody-poos a cold gun lesson
I'm the wizard of mayhem, master of destruction
Got a 44 mag, with the blunt instructions
Page 1 says open, page 2 says fill
Page 3 says cock, page 4 says kill
A mini 14, full combat dress
A thirty round clip, and I ain't takin' no mess
Cause I'm a rough agressor, a camouflage dresser
My M16 has a flash suppressor
My Sterling mark six , it's funny but it hits
It looks sideways but the sucker will kick
I pack of dangerous beretta, kinda small but its good
Some of you wannabes wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier
I'm a hip hop soldier

Now I'm about to get go, so I better clean up
I'm not avigatin' crime, but you gotta get tough
I don't believe in gun control, the theory is proven
Give a criminal a gun, and your public is losin'
For you gotta fight back, cause the pigs ain't black
No protection in your section, now it's time to act
A 22 won't due, you need rapid fire
I’m an ammo collector not a dumb gun buyer
Big battle rifles, can make a suckers day
You mess around with mixalot, you might get blown away
Wearin' 5 gold rings, never intimidated
In Seattle they are jealous, cause a brother has made it
But they don't mess with me, cause they might get Iced
I'm not a gang rapper, I don't like to get knifed
The devil made me do it, and I wannabe good
Don't you roody-poos wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...

I'm runnin' hollow point bullets, in my 38
So if you plan to get ill, you better stay in your place
Cause I'm not a game player, I'm just a rhyme sayer
My vigilante group includes my mayor
I pack two uzis cause they stop all crime
You might get yours, but don't let me get mine
I never beat woman, romance is better
If a freak wants to leave, boy you might as well let her
West coast rappers we all bust hard
When we chillin' on the set, we never need a bodyguard
People in Seattle hate me, cause I'm not like a hood
Some of you wannabes wish that you could

Be a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldier ...
I'm a hip hop soldierI'm peelin off domes with a baseball bat
Forty-four Magnum, choice of gat
Mercury tip fillin up my clip
I can shoot him in the dome or I can get him in the hip
But boom, look at all the niggas runnin out the room
Just another soldier, causin doom
No I don't bang but I like to wound... my enemy
Who is the enemy, I'm glad you asked
Any motherfucker standin in my path
Got a Bentley Turbo, now you wanna jack
But remember, Mack Daddy is strapped
And when you're platinum, niggas start dissin
Record companies think you're missin
But I'm back *clap clap (gunfire)*
I'm back *clap clap (gunfire)*
I'm back and I got a bigger gat *click BOOM*
Now the positive rhymes is onnnn
And I'm positively hittin that dome
You might want mine but you can't get mine
Rather put a hot nine right up in your behind
I'm not the nigga that you wanna recoup
And I don't wear a Giorgio suit
But I'm down for my business so please don't step
You heard about my lawfirm's rep, I check my bank

Chorus: DJ Punisher and Sir Mix-a-Lot

"Cash money, cash-cash.. money" "Boom! Here I am, rich"
Checkin my bank
"Cash money, cash-cash.. money" "Boom! Here I am, rich"
AhhhI checks my bank
"Cash money, cash-cash.. money" "Boom! Here I am, rich"
Straight checkin my bank
"Cash money, cash-cash-cash-cash.... cash money"

In the magazine I look like a dope man
Cause I'm paid, and I'm suckin up to no man
And in the rap game I gets no respect
Cause I'm checkin more bank than the Heat check
Yeah I'm a pimp and my ho is the system
Uncle Sam might think I just dissed him
But nah I'm just pumpin straight facts
You either be a mack, or you get macked
Some of the jealous wanna roll on the boss
But this HK's keepin em tossed
Cause I duck them deuce deuce treys at point blank range
*automatic gunfire* Attitudes get changed
I'm about making these dividends
And every motherfucker ain't my friend
And I check my back when I count my snaps
And niggas that snatch get slapped
Girls wanna roll, that's cool
But I'm not to be played that fool
Some niggas think a brother with money is slippin
But I've be down, so quit trippin
My goal, to increase the size of this bank
I hold, and bring up the brothers whose down
To roll, and keep all the shit under my control
That's how I'm livin, I check my bank

Chorus: DJ Punisher

"Cash money, cash-cash.. money"
"Clockin more dollars than Chase Manhattan"
*repeat 2X*

I check my bank *DJ Punisher starts scratch*
C'mon Punish! "Cash money"

A word to the cops, I can't be stopped
A word to my enemies, I don't drop props
A word to the Klan, I don't pick crops
You can run up with your whip but you'll just run up and get popped
A word to the Tipper, rap won't fall
A word to the bourgeoise, fuck all y'all
A word to Apartheid you bouts to fall
You can kill a couple brothers but you'll never get us all
Straight laced game's what I'm poppin at the new jacks
Mack Daddy niggas like to snatch fat sacks
I used to be nice with my rhymes, and now I drop dimes
*Beastie Boys scratch "What's the time?"*
It's time to get paid in the nine-two G
Recession never stopped a nigga like me
I'm breakin no laws but I'm livin on edge
Puttin CEO's to bed
Business, straight yankin in dead presidents
It's like sellin dope, but the money ain't bent
The game is stiff, but I'mma get mine
My set is a dollar sign, I check my bank

Yup, checkin my bank, fool, ha ha
Yup, I check my bank, sheeit
Straight checkin my bank
C'mon Punish! *DJ Punisher starts scratchin*
Punish em! Punish em!
Show these DJ's what time it is Punish
Peace out y'all, and I'm checkin my bank

Song: I Got Game

(Girls voice) "Man I wish I could find me a brother with some game"

To the rescue!

Here's a little somethin' for you whacked out suckers
Rollin' twenty-third, sellin' dope to cluckers
Your bank is thick, but you got no game
Spittin' at freaks runnin' superfly slang
I'm comin' up the ave' hard as hell
In a droptop 'Vette with a greenwood tail
Girls are jockin', lookin' for a knockin'
Smart investments, keep me clockin'
You know a 'Vette only got two seats
Just enough room for a player and a freak
Rollin' in the park, 'n I seen this cutey
L.A. face, with the Oakland booty
She's on tip, but I'm playin' that role
Talkin' to the home boys, showin' my gold
Skeez on bell, Levi's swell
I'm spittin' that game, and I'm spittin' it well
Rolled up, pulled up on the girly
"Girl you wanna ride in my 'Vette?"
"Why surely!"
That's right baby, blowin' me a kiss
Thinkin' Mixalot gonna make you rich
Highside, highside, vapors that's right
Can't get play cause my games so tight
Now she's wit' it, skirts in effect
Layin' on the back-a my 'vette
I got game, I got game, You know I got game, I got game

POP THAT GAME

Bye-bye baby, Mix gotta roll
Switch to the Benz and I gotta get mo'
Hit the strip, seen this skinny
Butt shook like a 426 Hemi
Not just butt, baby hadda motor
Stacked to the max, hair to the shoulders
She's older but I can mold 'er
Dropped that game and it hit like boulders
Now she's sprung, sittin' in my Benz
Rollin' up the tint so you can't see in
Playin' this tape of old Luther stuff
"You wanna get with me, this ain't wild enough"
That's a cue, sorry Luther
Brother you can sing, but I just can't use ya
Thought she was cool, but the girl likes beat
Freak freak freak freak, baby wanna freak
Def 'n dope, "You slangin'" Nope
Callin' me a dealer cause I sport fat rope
Kept poppin' that game, knowin' I can get it
"Take me to the lake Mix, so we can get wit' it"
Oh no, time for the ramble, bring a jimmy hat
Cause I hate to gamble
Huffed 'n puffed 'n I just got in
Messin' up the backa my Benz
I got game girl - I got game

Two down, two to go
Can't live my night right if I don't knock four
I'm in a big 500SEL
Interior hot, with a perfume smell
Took it on home, hit the shower
'Bout to get busy in one more hour
Ducks look, but they never will find me
Hopped in my number two Benz 190
Here a skirt, there a skirt
Everywhere a skirt, skirt
Gotta have game, if you wanna get work
"Ah, you ain't nothin'"
Some suckers wanna crush me
Smooth, wit' a move, baby girl. Rush me
Here it is, from the wizard of hip-hop
A lesson in game, make the girls get hot
Picked up a girl named Mattie
Caught static from the sucker in a seven-two caddy
Mattie was hot, but her name was "not"
I ain't worried 'bout that, I ain't tyin' no knot
Took her to the hotel, game went strong
She thought I spent bank, but I really spent coupons
But it's cool, cause my rhyme went smooth
Savin' my money, cause my mouth is a tool
Rolled up close, when I hit the spit
I ain't worried 'bout my breath, cause I brush my teeth
Popped that game, freak got weak
Hit that jackpot, swept them feet
Mattie got busy with the bedroom eyes
Layin' on the big king-sized
I got game - I got game, girl - I got game - I got game

Yeah that's right home cut, I got G A M E, snatchin' up girlies
An' rollin' up suckers, know whatta I mean

Through with Mattie that makes three
"I'm gonna miss you babe, you gonna miss me?"
Got loose cause the girl hadda big caboose
Hadda break down cause the girl had juice
"I'm gonna miss you baby"
Smooth ain't it? Girls so sprung that she almost fainted
Headin' for the crib, tired brother
Thinking I was through when I spotted me another
Baby looks good so you know what the means
Drive around the block with the gangsta lean
Open that sun roof, crank that beat
Bumpin' up the avenue, impressin' them freaks
What's up baby, rump so big? The girl's on tip like funk on pigs
Runnin that game, cause I wanna get work
Sit don't rip rap home girl shirt
Here she comes, hopped in my car
Somethin' 'bout my Benzo's star and bars
Spit, spit, runnin' that game
I'm feelin' confident about another thick dame
All of a sudden, my game got crushed
Some sucker pulled up and his ride was plush
Rolled up smooth, the girls was waitin'
5 point Oh, 24K Daytons
Oh-oh, think quick cause my girls jumpin' on home boys tip
Better change my game, try another lure
Cause home boys lookin' like Al B. Sure
But it's cool, cause I whipped out bank
Big dead presidents made her think
Back in effect, situation in hand
I'm the brother that the others can't stand
An' I got game, I got game, you know I got game(*background is Black Sabbath's "Iron Man," performed by the group Metal Church*)

(*chanting*)

[Verse 1]
You could strike a match in my hand
Too black to tan, heavy-metal rhythm from a one man band
Bust my knuckles in a junkyard scuffle
Whippin' adversaries with a brass belt buckle
Born in the ghetto, hard like metal
Got a '87 'vette with a fat gas petal
Live a hard life, shave with a knife
Love to get freaky on the gloomiest nights

[Hook]
I got childhood scars in the streets of my life
Girls laughed, now they beggin' to be Mix-A-Lot's wife
The new breed is here, vigilante's of rap
Got eyes like fire, with my boys at my back
Now I'm back for revenge, all the rumors must end
Freaky breathin' is out, bold music is in
I lot of dummies gettin' money, just by clappin' their hands
Not the style or desire of a true Iron Man

(You know what I wanna hear)

[Verse 2]
A southside broola don't drink coolers
Big money maker, not a dumb drug user
It's real not drama, hate pet llamas
Met Clint Eastwood, slapped his momma
Billboard thriller, Avenue chiller
Hard rock lover, and soft rock killer
Girls in the house, watch your blouse
I'm the man your momma was warnin' you about
The bad boy of rap, givin' no slack
Talk behind my back, and you might get slapped
You might get paid, but your metal ain't real
Your rock's like mush, this rock's like steel

[Hook]

(uh, everybody now, *chanting*)

[Verse 3]
A big ego crushin', MC's fussin'
More lines in my face than a sunburned Russian
Hardly ever speakin', girl's be tweakin'
Buggin' off the drums, cause the snare be peakin'
World's most hated, too bad to be rated
Makin' you mad and I'm elated
Beats sickapater, your bad I'm greater
Tougher than Schwarzenegger in "Terminator"
Guitar cord ripper, Perrier sipper
Transform scratchin' and not a needle skipper
Flesh like steel, MC's kneel
Mickey D's Shrimp Salad not part a my meal
Heavy drum hitter, can't stand kidders
Hate boss metal and I'm not a bullshitter
Girlies wanna kiss, suckers throw a fist
A lot of rappers try to rap, but it ain't like this

[Sir Mix-A-Lot talking]
Ha haha ha, the true Iron Man of rap droppin' this big metal hammer
(*voice yelling over Sir Mix-A-Lot*)
Now that's true metal, posse up, yeahHo, Ho, Ho
(I know I ain't hear somebody say
Nuthin about hoes up in here, sshhh, ooh lord)

What's up Dallas, what's up (x2)
Dallas jump on it, jump on it, jump on it

Mack Daddy
Ain't you tired of that gameless mark smackin' you in your face baby?
Mack Daddy
You better roll with the big mack, the man with the game
Mack Daddy
Gotta big snake, all you gotta do is make it dance, you know what I'm sayin'
Mack Daddy

[Verse 1]
I'm rollin' to another neighborhood
Me 'n my boyz, up to no good
Chasin' miniskirts 'n the ride is packed
Rollin' to a mall called SeaTac
Cruisin' 'n the cops don't like that
'Round the mall once 'n don't come back
Four-door Rolls with the black exterior
Turbo Bentley, white interior
A Rolls Royce fulla big black men
In the suburbs, messin' with citizens
Walkin' in the mall, looka how I spit
Sloppy dressed brothers make the females blitz
Big long starters, black low tops
Mack daddy hat got me lookin' like Pops
But that's cool, cuz, I'm mackin' anyway
'N your females my prey
'N I'm callin' out skirts like Chuck D
Sista we missed ya, get wit' me
Comin', runnin, your boyfriends gunnin'
The big boss is so cunnin'
Some of my home boys hate me
They get a microphone, then try to take me
But you ain't slip, sayin' what's up Mix?
Boy I'm hip to your tricks

[Hook]
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yeah ain't no reason to bet ya
Cause I'm the Mack Daddy
Steadily mackin'
Mack Daddy

[Verse 2:]
Kickin' in a buffed up Lamborghini
If your females proper she gots to see me
Cause I'm the king of the roll outs
Mack Daddy is back still runnin' my mouth
I see a freak on the SeaTac strip
My Lamborghini's brakes get grip
So I pull up on to The Spot
I start frontin', cause I wanna get jocked
Topped off the gas, whipped out my cash
'N one girls starts to laugh
But I'm still smooth
'N my game is on, so I make my move
Say, you in the white pants
I'm a step close to ya, but I won't dance
'N what you laughin' at
All the girls start pointin' at my hat
'N I'm a giggle wit' 'em, cause I just wanna get wit' 'em
I don't hit 'em, I just wanna stick 'em
So I pull baby girl to the side
She said she likes my car
I said take a ride
So we flipped up the doors on the Contach
But gettin' in a Lamborghini is hard
So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end
I thought she might need help gettin' in
So I clos' the do'
'N now you kno'
Mack Daddy is about to sco'
The girl said, baby you can have me
So I stopped at the tail
Cause I'm the Mack Daddy

[Hook]
Mack Daddy
All you all gameless marks know
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yew

[Verse 3:]
I don't smoke no weed, but I like to G
I don't mean O.G., I mean sex baby
Cause a brother like me don't date
I sling records 'n tapes
The Rhyme Cartel with the Def American
Gettin' brothers sprung like Farrakhan
'N I'm stuffin' my ladies pumps
In the backa my Benz I humps
I'm nasty 'n proud
To hell with cool, I'm G'in' 'em loud
Other people at the hotel gets no rest
Cause Mix-a-lots bumpin' them headrests
She got booty for days
Other brothers is pullin' up, but she ain't phased
Cause I laid my game like a concrete slab
She's the kinda skirt a mack gotta have
Rollin', showin' her off
'N some fool tried to call me soft
He's in a one nine seven two skin head caddy
A old superfly mack daddy
So my girl stepped out 'n he tried to mack
But she ain't havin' that
You see your game is weak, G
My girl, I ain't slappin', I'm mackin'
'N rappin'

[Hook]
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Come over here and get some of this snake
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack DaddyRun for the hills cause the mack is back
I'm hookin' up girls by fact
If you're stacked
You can rub a big mack
I gotta gas
So don't worry about scraps
(no, no)
Five foot eleven with a seven foot game
Gotta big mouth piece and I show no shame
Monster kinky have no morals
Monster loves to get oral (ummmm!)
Got ten cars and the girls like that
I was born and bred to be a mack
"What's your sign?" is played
You gotta put a style in your game now a days
In the sixties girls was all hot
LSD had 'em given up thigh
The baby boom was on I drop
No more Woodstock but now you got Mix-A-Lot
So put me in your CD changer
Watch your girl cause Mix's a re-arranger
Ooo, he's sexist
Doo, he's sexist
Keepin Rush Limbaugh restless
Well I'm da' mack and that's monster
Straight chase girls through the tail cause I wants to
You can call it wack
But you respect this black
When it comes to game I'm a monster mack

-Chorus:
Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Big Mack, Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
I'm a monster mack
Lookin for sex
Bih bih bih big big mack

Strike the pose
But she ain't nasty as me
Cause Mix-A-Lot is stuck on freaky
Can't stop tappin that tweety
Give it to the needy
Nope, cause I'm too damn greedy
Here I go walking through the mall
Don't play ball
But I got game for 'em all
Focus on a victim, Focus on a victim
Mr. Richard is hot so lets sick em
And like a tomahawk jumpin'' on a skillet
Girl you got to gimp my puhh
The pick up king is back buddy
Tryin' to give lessons to these thick ass ballers and understudies
I'm not tryin' to call you no bitch girl
Don't give a damn if your poor or rich girl
And we can play a pool
And I'm pokin' that 8-ball cool
And the bootys
I still like the bootys
She got a little waist doin' squats just to keep me on my duty
Giant size games what I droppin'
Straight freaks with these thick ol' gluts is what I'm knockin'
Now the right wing wanna test me
If likin' sex is a crime then you arrest me
But don't tell me who to sing to Jack
Cause a third of your life is in the sack
I'm a monster mack

-Chorus-

Drivin' my car by the bus stop
Till I spot a young cutie straight suckin' down a soda pop
Baby girl's winkin'
Mix-A-Lot's thinkin'
Hope this girl's feet ain't stankin'
Cause I don't like stank in my automobile, oight
So when you get inside, don't soil
The carpet is clean so wipe your feet outside
Step on in and let's ride
Here we go
Swing by Franglors
Get a little Soul Food
Now you got a brother in the mood
Damn gotta get her home with the quickness
For this warriors a witness
No need to put my girls on tilt
Cause straight up game will get your milk
The nasty dog is back
With straight pimp game black
Ain't no shame
I'm a monster mack

-Chorus-Artist: Sir Mix-a-Lot
Album: Seminar
Song: My Hooptie

My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin'
Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin'
Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin' tabs expired
Girlies tryin' to dis 'n say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket, cause my Benz is in the shop

My hooptie - my hooptie

Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep

Cars barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared, so I got on
Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong
Posse moved north, headin for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
I pot-hole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother cause I'm plowin' over suckers

In a hooptie

It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned
(Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a u-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brother start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets
I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-C-O
Military, competition. You know
I ain't really fazed, cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough, cause I got much fame
"How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot"
"Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock"
Ooooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing
Runnin' that game with the home made slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped

By a hooptie

Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot
"Whatcha want me to do Mix?"
Push freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hard core brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nuthin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said "Damn, they all look like Tyson"
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go
This bucket ain't rollin' in snow

It's my hooptie
