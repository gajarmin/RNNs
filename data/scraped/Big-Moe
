Stayin down with the cattle
I shake, then I rattle
I might just come through
It's all about that grain
Might be all what on ya lesson
Teachin I might be stressin
I gots to come through to
Young G's I be stressin
17, Promethazine, creases in my jean
Pimpin', 6 screens
I'm comin through wreckin mic
Toting the weed I'm showin dope fiends
I ain't got time for pointing no red dot
I'm just bustin'
I ain't got time for no caps
I ain't sipping no Robitussin
We sipping that barre
TV/VCR, we renting that car no destination
We come thru on incarceration
I'm fresh off playing Playstation
In the what hoo-doo
I ain't sellin' no Zulu
I might just pop trunk now these
Hoes they doin' Voodoo
They wanna try to stick me
The foes want for 60
I'm might just come back
With Poyo instead of 50
Key-C is gonna shine
That boy Shaun reclined
I hit the Long Drive now it's time I do mine
It's time I just chill and lay back and sip a 8
I'm sittin' sideway
TV on tha scrape plate
They don't hate when they see
We coming, we don't fuss
We don't even cuss
We swanga's on the bus: Damn!(Chorus 2x)
It's the Barre Baby (huh?)
The Barre Baby (who?)
The Barre Baby (what?)
The Barre Baby

[Verse 1]
Now for all y'all who ain't heard of me
Mr. M.O.E. the Barre baby
I'm a south side living legend
A third ward, bone hard street veteran
It all started in 93'
High school I was a fool I was only 18
With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar
Rollin a foreign through the streets of third ward
It was hard momma saw me with a case of codeine
And promethazine now I'm the codeine fiend
And my team was the coldest everyday we rolled thick
Niggas and hoes on dick because were screwed up click

Time to get paid , time to get laid
Time to ball and parlay
Time to smoke hay
Time for sace' shades
Make the trunk wave
Time to get sprayed
This is for my niggas in the cage, living in a rage
See mo-yo done turned the page

She was all up in my grill (my grill)
So I showed her my big daddy steel (big daddy steel)
I'm just a dog, don't blame me (a dog don't blame me yeah)

[Big Moe]
Rolling on a Sunday, with the top down
Hit that M-L-K, popped up show some round
Headed to a bitch, that I knew from way back
She use to be skinny, but now that ass ain't flat
She said Moe-Yo, I didn't know that you rap
I remember you singing, way back at the Jack
Yates in a Delta 88, scraping plates
All up and down 2-88 (8-8)
I said, girl you remember that shit
Me, Herms Tooley, keep it with the hitting licks
Use to have boys sick, we use to skip school
Acting a damn fool, at Gravestone and TSU
It use to be you, Kiesha, Bridget and Tanesha
And your whole damn crew
Tell me what it do, are we clubbing tonight
Maxo sound Throwed, yeah we thugging tonight, iight

[Hook]

[Big Moe]
I jumped in the Gator, leaving the South Park
On the way to the crib, it was almost dark
You know a big dude, gotta hop up in the shower
You already know, it took about a hour
I jumped out fresh, and dropped out clean
Hit the fo' for green, hit the stash for the lean
Grabbed my bling bling, Screwed Up around my neck
Grabbed a tech, for them boys who failed to respect
And the ones with the plex, you will get your days darkened
So move around, and watch me hit the lot without even parking

[Hook]

Oooh-ooh-ooooh-oh-ooooooh

[Big Moe]
Pulled up on the lot, just finished off a sweet
Dropped a hot twenty, valeted the SUV
Long line at the club, it's going down they made us back
But the big boss playa, gon pa-pass all that
That's when I noticed, you and your crew
Screaming Big Moe, can we come in with you
Hell yeah you want a G, V.I.P
They got the whole section, roped off just for me
That's when your friends, started eyeballing me
Like she was fascinated, with the Barre Baby
One thang led to the next, it's a bit of some sex
I know I met you first, didn't mean to disrespect
But me and baby girl, had a chemistry
And I know you heard, of my history
Big Moe dog, ain't lazy with the law
I'm a lover dude, I can serve both of y'all

[Hook]

Oooh-ooh-ooooh-oh-hey-heeeey-yeah

With a chain full of rocks and princess cuts in my watch

Or I might be flippin tippin on four vogues

A lot people now mad cuz I'm hot
But they gone be even madder when that jag leave the lot

Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side

[Big Moe]
Everybody clap yo' hands, and sing along wit me
It's Big Moe, da barre baby, representin these Southside streets
Now if you ain't heard of me then you don't know wassup
You can find me on them Screw CD's talkin about 'Purple Stuff'

[Hook]
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll)

[Big Moe]
Now see it started back in seventy-fo', Teri gave life to Moe
See momma was a hustler, daddy was a buster, y'all know how that go
I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'mma state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs;
Man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you wanna know what's in my cup..

[Hook] - 1/2

[D-Gotti]
Now.. now.. now..
That 'Purple Stuff', that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar (?)
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'mma go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, (?) clipper
Catch a playa leanin impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now.. now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the fo' wit a Crush Pineapple
Gotti gon' last long but I ain't sippin wit dat bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a playa had about enough..

[Hook]

[Repeat Intro, mingle with Hook and ad libs]

I love that Purple Stuff, yeah..(*Big Moe & Mike singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
One puff two puffs, I'm hooked like handcuffs
A thrush and a head rush, says that I've had enough
I'm sprung hear it comes, down a pathway through my lungs
A cloud of cluddered smoke, blends with my oxygen
The one human being, can't give me this satisfaction
Your centrifugal force, causes a chain reaction
The strategy you use, is addictive to many
One of you is not enough, I need five or twenty
I smoke plenty, menage tois with cigars
Wrapping weed like cigars, puts my mind on bars
Cut it down the middle, split it like the Red Sea
Show love filled with buds, fresh off the ganja tree
I'm on optimoes, force feeding you these flows
The aroma of marijuana, hits like Tyson blows
Boat loads of do-do, I'm in Akapoko
Tooty and fool coo-coo, but I'm going loco I'm blowed

[Hook: Breeze]
Just roll up a blunt, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, 24/7 3-65
Roll up a blunt yeah, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, just to keep you satisfied

[Big Pokey]
Dump me in and close the do', let's take some pressure off ya brain
We three deep up on this thang, me and you and Mary Jane
From a bud to a grain, propane to a flame
Inhaling this octane, getting wet from all this rain
Everything is everything, I'm a certified choker
Light green smoker, put the heat to the ocra
Drop the three in the Fruitopia, we on cruise control
Or take 'em straight to the dome, cause it sooths the soul
I'm a puff-puff passer, doja square crasher
Getting my high to the sky, like a rocket out of NASA
Like players with asthma, bronchitis and ecetra
As for me I'm a tree, till you see red in my retna
Gone off Long and-a, this fire I'm loving
Massive puffing, chiefing smoking like a broke oven
Plus this sack I'm juggling, got us high as a kite
Cigarella's full of flight, what a hell of a night it's going down

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's splendid, the weed is heavenly scented
Puff-puff pass, is highly recommended
Till massage the brain, relieve migranes
And keep Sensei calm, when he's off the chain
You must maintain, and try to keep your composure
Whether hydro or cess, or some potent doja
Let me expose ya, to the pride of the front
Empty out the cigars, and just roll up a blunt roll it

[Hook]

(*singing*)[Z-Ro]
Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West
And plenty drank for your kin and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't tryin to go to war
The common denominator in the situation is bar
Like a star You can shine with me
Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
C'mon and try to ease your mind with me
Stady be celebratin, for payin our dues
So much drank in my cup cause the sodawater won't even move
I's a playa - and associate with the plexin
Bone hard Ridgemont, Mo City, Texas
A veteran don't get me wrong cause Im quick to blast
Rather pour you a glass instead of beatin on your ass!!
Take a chill pill pill
Blow some kill, pop the steal
Since we won't be seen
Sippin syrup from police
From the thirty-third coast it ain't no roachin
Just fill your cup up to the brim and have a toast to this

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In the dirty-third, the city of syrup, bangin screw)

Still come up with substance to make them hit the floor

Bumpers scrape against the road
Flosh low, concert, looking like a lumber yard
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the Visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some stacks
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw
Click click clack clack, get your wimp ass threw

Your minor setback leads to major combat
Improper contact leads to mortal combat
Hole in your starter hat and your skull gets cracked
Now I walked all on you like you're a doormat
Two hataz I break half squash yall chit chat
If your patna is real he'll never turn his back

First Verse [Juvenile]:

I'm in the jungle, of niggas that's lookin' for static,
Two niggas stuck and jackin' just to support his habit
Them people rollin', so I gotta do what I can
I gotta pound of that sand I picked up from the man
The luxuries I gotta have it, black savage
He's in the streets holdin' up traffic
With the plastic, Desert Eagle .45 automatic,
My glass is, filled with J.D. and coca-cola classic
And niggas that playa-hate I got somethin' for yo asses
I'mma act a donkey, boy you best not run up on me
You niggas phony, that's why I did that to your homie
For instance, when the Mac-9 will erase your existence
So distance, yourself from me cuz my conscience be clickin'
Niggas be paranoid when they see I be dippin'
Sayin', man let me go, he bout to stomp on that trigger
Somebodies wig get split in the middle of the street
I got your brains to show you bitches, stop playin' with me
And ain't no thing I got my Ruger and I ain't' scared to die
Cross that line and I'mma shoot'cha and tell your Mommy bye-bye
Hungry for money, like vampires hungry for blood
Better get to runnin', solja reeboks is in the mud

Chorus [Bulletproof]:

Phase, a blast of foolishness went through his head
With a strap hollerin' "Nigga what you said?"
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Juvenile you did that?
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Juvenile you did that?
Man, Juvenile you did that...

Second Verse [Big Moe]:

Don't get caught up fools, in the wrong way
Cuz them niggas out that Lio stay totin' them A.K.'s
The baddest trigga happy niggas I ever saw
Calliope niggas play the muthafuckin' game raw
So don't get'cha self in a jam
Cuz these niggas I hang with really don't give a damn
With the quickness, nigga they put them K's to use
Niggas like Wango, Wine, Spig, and my boy Deuce
So any nigga want some drama get strapped,
So I can put your bitch ass in my Rest In Peace rap
Cuz dead, yeah, is what'cha gonna be
If you fuck with this nigga from that C-P 3,
So don't be fuckin' with me
Cuz you'll be lookin' down the barrel of a nine double M, homie
And with a nigga like me, holdin' the gat,
I'mma pull the fuckin' trigger and bust ya head to the fat
Then watch your brain run down the city drain
And after that, leave the spot cuz Frank Mignon's comin' to get the remains
So all you gangsta ass niggas tilt your hat
And plus that bullshit y'all niggas out here are tryin' to do?
I fuckin' been there and done that

Chorus [Bulletproof]:

Phase, a blast of foolishness went through his head
With a strap hollerin' "Nigga what you said?"
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Big Moe you did that?
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say Big Moe you did that?

Third Verse [B.G.]:

Don't make me pull my pistol nigga, cuz fa-shiggidy I'mma use it
This life you strugglin' through you gone lose it
I come through actin' foolish, with semi-automatics
Shit get hectic, blast, or get blasted
I'mma a Baby Gangsta bout drama, bout buckin'
Full of that dustin', you bust, I'm bustin'
You shoot, I shoot
You miss, I hit
Hot Boy representin' that gangsta shit
Stop playin' with the young soldier, believe
You jeopardizin' what's on your shoulder, you shoot at me
Take it to the streets, you ain't bout that action
Packin' two twenty-three's, sweepers knock you off your feet
St. Thomas still got them bags for twenty-five
Before I go on the pride, I'm full of that Worldwide
Goin' for crime I'll spank them, can't swim with the sharks
Through this water, muthafucka I'll spank'em
Get'cha mind right, nigga, fuckin' with me
Think twice I tote iron I'mma a true B.G.,
Fuckin' right, I split hats, and I tote Mac's
I be fuckin' with silver packs, now what you know about that?
Got the all black fit, ready to put in work
But niggas actin' like jerks, I put dicks in the dirt
I run with Juvenile, cuz he's a gangsta ass nigga
Niggas huntin' like they bout it, but I'll spank that ass nigga
So who wants some beef? Let me show you I don't play
Told ya I'm that type that'll hit'cha block everyday
If you're real, you'll bust back
But if you fake, I got'cha warning in all-black
It's no escape, I did that

Chorus [Bulletproof]:

Phase, a blast of foolishness went through his head
With a strap hollerin' "Nigga what you said?"
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say B.G. you did that?
That iron again is mine right? Snatchin' for a kidnap
People out that project say B.G. you did that?
Man, Juvenile you did that...[Hook]

Coming down with the 5th in the back
And I'm feelin so true
Got much love for my nigga named Screw

He broke em all down and we all got high
And niggas don't be tripping, don't

Wrecking whole H-town, coming through and we down

All that shit, all that shit is good
And everything I have gotta be wood
All over, even in a Range Rover

You know I'm talkin about it's that damn Kici

We swanga's on the bus: Damn![Hook]
I was at the club one night (one night)
That's when I saw some hype (saw some hype)
She looked kinda throwed to me (she looked kinda throwed yeah)
She was all up in my grill (my grill)
So I showed her my big daddy steel (big daddy steel)
I'm just a dog, don't blame me (a dog don't blame me yeah)

[Big Moe]
Rolling on a Sunday, with the top down
Hit that M-L-K, popped up show some round
Headed to a bitch, that I knew from way back
She use to be skinny, but now that ass ain't flat
She said Moe-Yo, I didn't know that you rap
I remember you singing, way back at the Jack
Yates in a Delta 88, scraping plates
All up and down 2-88 (8-8)
I said, girl you remember that shit
Me, Herms Tooley, keep it with the hitting licks
Use to have boys sick, we use to skip school
Acting a damn fool, at Gravestone and TSU
It use to be you, Kiesha, Bridget and Tanesha
And your whole damn crew
Tell me what it do, are we clubbing tonight
Maxo sound Throwed, yeah we thugging tonight, iight

[Hook]

[Big Moe]
I jumped in the Gator, leaving the South Park
On the way to the crib, it was almost dark
You know a big dude, gotta hop up in the shower
You already know, it took about a hour
I jumped out fresh, and dropped out clean
Hit the fo' for green, hit the stash for the lean
Grabbed my bling bling, Screwed Up around my neck
Grabbed a tech, for them boys who failed to respect
And the ones with the plex, you will get your days darkened
So move around, and watch me hit the lot without even parking

[Hook]

Oooh-ooh-ooooh-oh-ooooooh

[Big Moe]
Pulled up on the lot, just finished off a sweet
Dropped a hot twenty, valeted the SUV
Long line at the club, it's going down they made us back
But the big boss playa, gon pa-pass all that
That's when I noticed, you and your crew
Screaming Big Moe, can we come in with you
Hell yeah you want a G, V.I.P
They got the whole section, roped off just for me
That's when your friends, started eyeballing me
Like she was fascinated, with the Barre Baby
One thang led to the next, it's a bit of some sex
I know I met you first, didn't mean to disrespect
But me and baby girl, had a chemistry
And I know you heard, of my history
Big Moe dog, ain't lazy with the law
I'm a lover dude, I can serve both of y'all

[Hook]

Oooh-ooh-ooooh-oh-hey-heeeey-yeah

(*vocalizing*)(*talking*)
You know I'm talkin bout, everybody here
Trying to get outta something, you know I'm saying
But we ain't perfect though, so judge me
Like you judge yourself, you know I'm saying leave me alone

[Hook: Big Moe & Mike Wislon - 2x]
Trying to leave drank alone (leave drank alone)
I'm trying to leave drank alone (trying to leave drank alone)

[Big Moe]
It's the Big Moe the Barre Baby, and I want to
Say thank you, to all my fans and friends
For helping me through, what I been through
Lately thangs been crazy, but it's all good
I'mma stay on my knees, and pray for every
Ghetto and, every hood
Nobody's perfect, not by a long shot
The problems I got, I know we all got
I never give up, when times get hard
Keep my head up, and keep my faith in God yeah

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Big Moe ain't no role model, I'm only human
It's a shame, how the world be judging us
For thangs that, we be doing
Now I know, that I'm getting older
And it seems, the world is so much colder
And success, put stress on my shoulder
Now I'm pouring less, in my soda
Man I miss, them days of being young
Big sipping big pimping, having fun
But nobody sip more, than the Moe
When you see me flip, Moe-Yo gotta go yeah

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Now I'm realizing, I'm about to lose
Till I woke up to bad news so sad
I had to lose my patna Screw
Big Moe just ain't sanging, what I ain't gon do
What I'mma sang about, all the things
That I know, my niggas go through
From the right, I'm just living my life
Trying to play these cards, I'm dealt with a right
We all struggle, and going through thangs
But I know, it's just growing pains
What they say, Big Moe ain't gon sip
Getting week five for dip, but I do know this
I'm slowing down, take it one day at a time

Staying on my grind, trying to get mine
Trying to leave it alone yeah, trying to leave it alone
Trying to leave it alone yeah, trying to leave it alone yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm try-i-ing, trying to leave this drank alone

[Hook](Big Moe)
Oooooh, yeeeeeah
Take it from a thug, take it from a thug

[Hook: Big Moe - 2x]
Thug niggas, never sweat these hoes
Cause playas, always get chose
So you don't gotta trick, your do'
If you real you gon hit playa, take it from a pro

[Mr. 3-2]
Now playas, still don't sweat these hoes
Spitting conversation, while I ride deuce-4's
You know's how I do, I get paid off a trick
Changed my name from Mr. 3-2, to Pimp Chris
I ain't ya suga daddy, like Willie Fu-Fu
2003, girls got on they choosing shoes
Keep my pockets paid, my Harley got sprayed
They breaking they toes, to keep daddy living laid
Playa made, from the bottom to the top
Making boys drop out, 'fore them panties drop
I hopped in this pimping, cause girls love a playa
Do anything I say, and come back with that thay-ar
With no problem, or harassment at all
That's why when I'm in the mall, we all gon ball
Gucci for them, and a mink for me
Baby playas get chose, it ain't hard to see

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' O]
I don't grab they arms, I don't pinch they ass
These hoes know, when they see a young nigga with cash
Cleaner than a motherfucker, like I just took a bath
So when these hoes walk by, how the fuck can they pass
A nigga like me up, she know that it's real
Plus I'm from Big Ballin' Texas, she know that I'm trill
And she heard that I can fuck, she wanna know how it feel
I'ma take her to me bedroom, and show her my skills
Cause I'm a playa that get chose, it's my call of duty
And I wage war with cot, and I brawl with booty
And this message goes out to, all my cuties
That I done beat the pussy up, and put all them movies
Had the time of your life, girl your nigga's a G
And you always gon call me, cause your nigga's a flea
And everytime you go to sleep, boo you dreaming bout me
Cause deep down I'm everything, you want your nigga to be
A gangsta a gentleman, plus I talk with class
But I'll still bend you over, and walts that ass
Pull your perm acting out, once I'm talking trash
Like baby who pussy this, pop-pop that ass

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's, still lovely
I'm on drank, I done chilled off the Bubbly
Niggas mad, cause they hoes wanna fuck me
But these boys, these boys they bet not touch me if you ugly
Boys wondering why, they hoes be fiending
Cause they done licked on my nuts, and swallowed my semen
Hoes be dreaming, of having sex with me
And these jealous ass niggas, got plex with me
See girls get full of that, extasy
And they all wanna fuck me, O and 3
Since I'm the H-A-W-K, I'm doing things my way
I fucked her and her, and your fiance
Your girl was bootylicious, just like Beyonce
And your niggas wanna be like me, someday
No how no way, can he do this
And how many hoes, out there suck dick

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Take it from a pro, baby
3-2 and Lil' O, baby
H.A.W.K. and Big Moe, baby
Take it from a pro - 2x[Intro: Big Moe]
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side

[Big Moe]
Everybody clap yo' hands, and sing along wit me
It's Big Moe, da barre baby, representin these Southside streets
Now if you ain't heard of me then you don't know wassup
You can find me on them Screw CD's talkin about 'Purple Stuff'

[Hook]
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll)

[Big Moe]
Now see it started back in seventy-fo', Teri gave life to Moe
See momma was a hustler, daddy was a buster, y'all know how that go
I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'mma state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs;
Man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you wanna know what's in my cup..

[Hook] - 1/2

[D-Gotti]
Now.. now.. now..
That 'Purple Stuff', that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar (?)
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'mma go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, (?) clipper
Catch a playa leanin impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now.. now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the fo' wit a Crush Pineapple
Gotti gon' last long but I ain't sippin wit dat bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a playa had about enough..

[Hook]

[Repeat Intro, mingle with Hook and ad libs]

I love that Purple Stuff, yeah..(*Big Moe & Mike singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
One puff two puffs, I'm hooked like handcuffs
A thrush and a head rush, says that I've had enough
I'm sprung hear it comes, down a pathway through my lungs
A cloud of cluddered smoke, blends with my oxygen
The one human being, can't give me this satisfaction
Your centrifugal force, causes a chain reaction
The strategy you use, is addictive to many
One of you is not enough, I need five or twenty
I smoke plenty, menage tois with cigars
Wrapping weed like cigars, puts my mind on bars
Cut it down the middle, split it like the Red Sea
Show love filled with buds, fresh off the ganja tree
I'm on optimoes, force feeding you these flows
The aroma of marijuana, hits like Tyson blows
Boat loads of do-do, I'm in Akapoko
Tooty and fool coo-coo, but I'm going loco I'm blowed

[Hook: Breeze]
Just roll up a blunt, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, 24/7 3-65
Roll up a blunt yeah, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, just to keep you satisfied

[Big Pokey]
Dump me in and close the do', let's take some pressure off ya brain
We three deep up on this thang, me and you and Mary Jane
From a bud to a grain, propane to a flame
Inhaling this octane, getting wet from all this rain
Everything is everything, I'm a certified choker
Light green smoker, put the heat to the ocra
Drop the three in the Fruitopia, we on cruise control
Or take 'em straight to the dome, cause it sooths the soul
I'm a puff-puff passer, doja square crasher
Getting my high to the sky, like a rocket out of NASA
Like players with asthma, bronchitis and ecetra
As for me I'm a tree, till you see red in my retna
Gone off Long and-a, this fire I'm loving
Massive puffing, chiefing smoking like a broke oven
Plus this sack I'm juggling, got us high as a kite
Cigarella's full of flight, what a hell of a night it's going down

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's splendid, the weed is heavenly scented
Puff-puff pass, is highly recommended
Till massage the brain, relieve migranes
And keep Sensei calm, when he's off the chain
You must maintain, and try to keep your composure
Whether hydro or cess, or some potent doja
Let me expose ya, to the pride of the front
Empty out the cigars, and just roll up a blunt roll it

[Hook]

(*singing*)[Big Moe:]
I sip codeine
It makes a southside playa lean (makes me leeeaaaan)

(Hawk)
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of alleigence to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C
And that's all for Mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

(Chorus)
Screwed Up Click, my click of G's
Ahh you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with my click, it's the S.U.C
And they call me, the Barre Baby

(Big Moe)
See when we floss our candy rides
Screens keep falling from the sky
Players ball and we stay true
And if you want to test my click
I pop problems what you get
S.U.C. and we god damn fools
We got that purple sticky dank
Chased with purple sticky drank
And forever we gone bang screw
Oh it's the Screw in us, we gone represent with pride
It's the Screw in us till we die

(Chorus)
Screwed Up Click, my click of G's
Ahh you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Po, rolling with the Pokey
Can''t forget about, the Lil' Keke

(Lil' Keke)
Devistating and motivating it's the S.U.C
Showing and blowing up since the year 93'
Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thinG's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of G's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreckshop, come on

(Chorus)
Screwed Up Click, gone keep it true
R.I.P. to, that DJ Screw
We gone mourn you till we join you
And I want to say to you, without you fool

[Verse 1: E.S.G.]
Now would the freestyle kings stand up?
Hol up I'm kinda sluggish all this lean in my cup
But I'm washed up
Redrum
Sittin in 22's
Princess cut
Lightin up my Japanese tattoos
I paid dues
Tell them fools
Tell them feds I'm back
Ghetto bred pit bull
I ain't scared to scratch
I'm out the gate
Po eight
Cause I don't give a damn
HPD be lookin at me like my name was Gary Graham
Watch my trunk slam
And my crack fool
Nigga ride wit a fo fo
Bout to decide to shit you
Viewed the loop
Sound the news
All these niggas been hatin on us
Big blue lights
Lookin tight
Twinkle the ice
Hes ready to bust
Switched it up
Ounce up
Diamond grill
Big rim too real
Two tone green
Four fifteen
Six inch screens and Bentley grill
Sandra hill
Sammy Sosa
Im out livin la vida loca
E.S.G., Z-Ro, Big Moe
You know we takin over

[Hook: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Repeat 2x

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
Big M O E
Pint sippers can't fuck wit me
Fired out sippin drank blowin tree
Did a couple of pints and I'm still not sleep
Three deep screamin S U C
Hatas betta not plex wit me
I bet you can't get next to me
On my toes orange juice and ecstasy
They try to make me lose my mind
Fuck around and make me use my nine
That's why I gotta take a cruise up town
Playa hatas jockin me just because I'm starched down
Ballin out of control
And my AC blow cold
Big Moe all up in yo face
Never need a skee taste
Knockin off codeine by the caaaaase

[Hook: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Repeat 2x

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Guerilla Maab one deep
And I Represent it forever
Them other two bitch made niggas got cut their tires got severed
I'm all alone
Bring it on
Cause I get wet till I'm drippin
Fuckin wit Z-Ro
You be dealin wit Rugers while they rippin
I'm still the Mo City don
Rap game phenomenon
Forever raw
But niggas changin like chameleons
Sugar coated for bitches to make em dance and stuff
Ol durag wearin ass nigga wit yo pants leg up
Lookin weaker than water
I startle any contender
Ridgemont 4 representer
Blue over grey foreign corner bender
Ya betta return to sender
Cause we ain't havin that
S U C been wreckin since niggas was doin the cabbage patch
E.S.G. M O E droppin the verse A to the Z
Demolish your muthafuckin AK leave it cocked up on three
Nothing but murder we roll wit plenty fetti up in our hands
So you can keep watchin me yaaaaaa

[Hook: Big Moe and Z-Ro]
Repeat 2x

[Z-Ro]
The odor
The odor
The odor[Big Moe]
It's the Moe-torola, too big for the Yoda
I ain't riding in a Honda, cause I might tip it over
Man it's big daddy, gon need a big Caddy
Hogging four lanes, so them boys can't pass me
Or that big Benz, or that big truck
So when I get in, I'm popped up on big buck
Big wood big boom, in the hood with Big Toon
They bopping in the mall, cause we shop at Big & Tall
Big boys gon ball, spring and the fall
The winter and the summer, in a stretched out Hummer
Bad guy with the lummer, bass beating like a drummer
Big dreams big schemes, big nigga and I'm doing big things

[Noke D]
Big house big car, big money big star
Big nigga showing up, big spender at the bar
Big fat muddy cup, big ass on the buck
Big tire whole truck, big rims buttoned up
Big grill for the hoes, man you already know
Big boys put it down, big boys get chose
I like big brown eyes, and big round thighs
A lil' round navel, and a big ring inside
Got ol' nuts, big glory my story
Big clutch playa, like big Robert Horry
Big piece big chain, big name big fame
Big this big that, big every damn thang

[Hook]
Going low, and known to tip slow
It's Big Moe, I'm stepping through the do'
Slow and low, it's moving tip pole
It's Big Moe, I'm stepping through the do'

[Big Toon]
Big black Expedition, big deuce-deuce inches
Two big Glock bitches, 'case boys big sixes
Big Toon I ain't tripping, I'm all about the riches
Gotta have big figgas, so I stay in the kitchen
I stay cooking O's, weighing 28 grams
Big dude damn fool, man that's who I am
Big boss playa, pretty ho layer
It's Big Toon, Noke D and the Big Mayor
Slap a bitch in the mouth, talking down on the South
We so hot, a deep freezer couldn't cool us off
Big guns around here, will get your brains pushed out
Come around playing games, will get your name crossed out bitch

[Hook]

[D-Gotti]
I ain't bigger than the average, but I'm larger than life
Like a throwing Pit, can't control his bark and his bite
Sight me in some'ing big, on some big ol' rims
Big on these bad bitches, but I like ghetto slim
As I slim, through my big black book
Trying to let these hoes know I'm trying to get at em, with this big black hook
Shook the block, with the big ol' 18's in the trunk
And resting 'cross the back seat, is a big ol' pump
Boys don't want none, the bigger they are the harder they haul
It's different with spinning rims, the bigger they are the harder the car
And when I haul in the club, I get big love from the streets
See I'm a independent big hard, chasing big dreams come on

(Chorus - Big Moe)
It's Big M - O - E
It's that playa big ass Moe
Still jammin my music slow
Been a long time on my grind
But you know the barre baby stayin down
And we got the whole world screwed up
The hood love me like drank in the cup
Still a dog, still reppin my home
Candy red still rollin on chrome
I gotta fresh PT on ice, pour up with me(up with me)
If you represent ya city, let me see you throw ya sets up high with me(high with me)

[Verse 1 - Big Moe]
Ain't shit changed, still sippin on a fo'
Gone for a minute but I'm here to let 'em know
The barre baby still on his grind
Platinum teeth so you know I'm gon'shine
H - Town we put it down
I'm a stand up while ya boy lay down
Rep the Screwed Up Click, got the rocks up on my wrist
Dirt up in my pass, scratch them haters off my list(It's Big M - O - E)
I'm throwed in the game
Big piece and chain and I'm holdin wood grain
Candy paint drippin you can call it purple rain
Keep my head on it when I'm in the turnin lane
Boys don't test I'm on point with the aim
Like my dogg Big Pokey I'm a pitt off the chain
Got on twenty - three's so you know I J - Walk
Let the trunk bump, R.I.P to Big Hawk

(Chorus - Big Moe)
It's Big M - O - E
It's that playa big ass Moe
Still jammin my music slow
Been a long time on my grind
But you know the barre baby stayin down
And we got the whole world screwed up
The hood love me like drank in the cup
Still a dog, still reppin my home
Candy red still rollin on chrome
I gotta fresh PT on ice, pour up with me(up with me)
If you represent ya city, let me see you throw ya sets up high with me(high with me)

[Verse 2 - Tyte Eyez]
Huh....Na, Na
Moe got the purple drank, I got the purple dank
Go on and pour me up a cup and I'm a make it stank
This candy paint gon'make 'em faint when we hit the scene
My nigga Eddie got me ready and I'm sittin mean
On that fat chrome, I keep a gat holmes
Cause ain't no tellins when these cats wanna get they jack on
And matter of fact holmes, I'm in the turnin lane
Like P - A - T one hand on the Glock, one hand on the grain
Bout to make the cielin rain while we hit the Trey
Moe done fell asleep I woke him up on M - L - K
Them hoes out today it's time to wake 'em up
He looked up and hit his cup and said....

(Chorus - Big Moe)
It's Big M - O - E
It's that playa big ass Moe
Still jammin my music slow
Been a long time on my grind
But you know the barre baby stayin down
And we got the whole world screwed up
The hood love me like drank in the cup
Still a dog, still reppin my home
Candy red still rollin on chrome
I gotta fresh PT on ice, pour up with me(up with me)
If you represent ya city, let me see you throw ya sets up high with me(high with me)

[Verse 3 - Dirty Dollar]
I hit that Motorola for the syrup and the soda
He said Dollar hold up me and Eyez crawlin down bout to roll up
Show up and pour mo'then a punk fo'up
With our heads in the clouds blazin this purple dro up
Makin these boys throw up - broads wanna get to know us
They just can't help but to stop, when the top relax and fold up
Know what, playas call it motivation
Haters gon'keep hatin, eighty fo's gon'keep skatin...down south
Know what I'm talkin about, reppin the House everytime I open my mouth
Reppin it right, them boys known for reppin it wrong
The H ain't been the same since the real been gone
Now it's on once again got our backs to the wind
Tippin for real ain't no need to pretend
Down till the end true to the corners we bend
It's a brand new day, and the Shop's right back again

(Chorus - Big Moe)
It's Big M - O - E
It's that playa big ass Moe
Still jammin my music slow
Been a long time on my grind
But you know the barre baby stayin down
And we got the whole world screwed up
The hood love me like drank in the cup
Still a dog, still reppin my home
Candy red still rollin on chrome
I gotta fresh PT on ice, pour up with me(up with me)
If you represent ya city, let me see you throw ya sets up high with me(high with me)
