[Intro: Andy Mineo & Marv Albert (Wordsplayed)]
What time, is it?
Gametime
Marv Albert: 1.3 seconds left in regulation and right now you're not thinkin' jump shot, all you need is a layup
Mineo: That's right Marv, nothin' fancy
Marv Albert: No cosmetics
Mineo: They've got a chance to win it here tonight at Dyckman courts. He throws it in, he's wide open
(Don't miss, don't miss)
Marv Albert: Ooh, he missed it at the horn

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Wavin' my American flag
Even though it got "Made in China" on the tag
Used to have the GT with the mags now my face in the mags
I ain't gotta brag, Momma said, “Let other people do that”
White man still can't jump
If I catch a fast break then I'm slappin' the glass
Ask my man Sequae, "Should I marry my girl"? He said, "Wait up, hold up
She fly, love God, and she got a good mind
Oh boy, that's a layup!"
Gotta take it when it come
Please don't miss it
What you bouta do with the rock?
When it’s game time for the wedding save me a ticket"

[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo]
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
What time is it?
Game time
Young boy, don't quit
One thing that you don't miss
That's a layup

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
That's easy boy
That's a lay up
That's a free-bee boy (fundamentals)
That's a lay up
Don't blow it
That's a lay up
That's easy buckets (Eazy-E)
That's a lay up

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Told Alex I don't want no more trap beats
Man, why you had to send this?
You know I couldn't resist
This is a finger roll, look at the flicka da wrist
That's an assist, no I insist
Throw me the alley, I'll oop it
Spanish girl up in my hood
Look me in the face said, "Don't be estupid", I got it
Look, shawty I'm the professor, get the lab coat
I speak two languages, Spanglish and infact-os
Coach told me no lollygaggin'
Still dunk with my pants saggin'
One sixteen, yeah, it's tatted
Cause I been ridin', no bandwagon
Look, I done came down
Nate told me that's H-Town
But I'm Boeheim, when it's game time
That's a lay up, but I never lay it down
You ain't even pray for the dinner
How you got the prayin' hands on the 'gram for the picture?
Shots on Twitter they ain't nothing but net
And we already won, we the pros, got next

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Wordsplayed]
Goin' down, NY
City don't sleep, let me close one eye
City don't weep, grown boys don't cry
Four wings with the pork fried, oh my
I'm schemin' up, teamin' up, lay it up
Screamin' out buckets, buckets
They don't even know me but swear that I did it for duckets, my Lord
We brought Sosa back to the minors
Lord help me, the money look major
She only love things that are finer
And she lookin' fine, boy, I tell you
That's two doors with the ceiling gone
That's five-four with the silicone
I guess Mr. Right still choosin' wrong
Colored folks still can't swim
But Mike Phelps couldn't walk the water
Pastor said that we need Jesus
Big state was his alma mater
Shouts to Alex, that's my brother
Shoutin' Dyckman over Rucker
Look at grace, I think I love her

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Outro: Andy Mineo & Marv Albert (Wordsplayed)]
Marv Albert: Aw, you shoulda taken the stairs young fella
Andy: You can't win 'em all Marv
Marv Albert: I can't believe he blew it
Andy: Unbelievable
Marv Albert: That's a ball game here in New York[Produced by 808xElite and Alex Medina]

[Intro: Andy Mineo]
Swerve, banzini
Uhh, fugetaboutit

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Paisano's wylin', paisano's wylin'
Red wine on everything, red wine on everything
Red wine on everything
Last call, it won't cost you anything
I stay wylin', I stay wylin'
I stay wylin', paisano's wylin'

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
(Banzini)
Say I won't rock Fubu, sucka
I don't do what you do, sucka
Waka Flocka Waka Waka
Westside like I'm 2Pac-a
(Westsiiiide!)
Hdddddd like I'm Chewbacca
(Star Wars, boy!)
Hdddddd like I'm Chewbacca

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I might just throw a Buddha 'round my necklace
They think paisano's wylin', that boy reckless
Cause everybody rockin Jesus pieces
I'm just doin what y'all doin, wearing stuff I don't believe in
Yuuup
You don't need skill for new rap
Check the first verse
You know I proved that
Takin' them selfies, girl why would you do that?
You know it's whack, and I do not approve that
I said red wine, I don't mean where the booze at
I'm talkin' an offer you just can't refuse that
On a swag boat, I'm the captain
You can walk the plank for the yapping
Boooooooi!

[Hook]

[Interlude: Martymar]
Hey yo, rappers carry my mother's groceries, dog
Out of respeeeeect!

[Verse 3: Marty]
Thirty chains around my neck, Mr. T and velour sweats
I got em like what's next?
I'm gonna kill the beat like an acapella
Social Club be them good fellas
Only good cause He met us
I'm a big mess and couldn't be better
Ahh, whatever, whatever, I'm wylin'!
Wylin', wylin', wylin'
It's the 116 and the Misfits, and we wylin'
Hey, yo, put my mom on the guest list
I'm so awkward, it's impressive
Girl's like, "Who the heck's this?"
You're kinda weird, but I respect it
I'm just young, and Italian, and reckless, and we wylin'!

[Hook]

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
Listen, under normal circumstances
If someone's running their piehole, just give 'em a good smack to the face
But I don't handle things the way I used to
I am a Christian boy now, you understand, capisce?
Listen, you keep on running your piehole
And I'm gonna take you over to my grandmother's house for a nice Sunday dinner
She'll have the [?] the fresh mozzarella, the marinara
We'll have a real good time
When you can't eat anymore we'll have her open up the fridge
And take out the canolis and the pustard shots
And keep feeding you and feeding you and feeding you, heh?
Then I'm gonna drive you home
Throw you in the bathroom, lock the door
And burn every piece of toilet paper you own, you schmutz!
God bless you and your family[Verse 1: KB]
Yeah, K to the second letter
How you want to do it homie?
I'm all up in it, down to the bone I feel it
Coming and breaking it down with that wiggity wiggity style
Man we really be living it out on mission
Flow God, no lie, oh yeah
We bust rhymes, one ride, no stops
Take 'em to show dog, see the most high, so high
Leave 'em so shocked frozen face like botox
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no stars up in this tour
See, the stars that my dogs love to applaud
Are the faithful saints that endure
You could never stop em'
You got a better chance winning the Tour de France
With no legs against Lance
Or seeing Mr. Edward Scissorhands
On Instagram taking a selfie
Your hell freeze before I'm ashamed off in my LP

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
All them really wanna come see
This beat 1-3-1-3
Get ape when I speak
Imma say my piece
Throw the peace sign with some boatload of truth if you can’t see
Yeah buddy, rollin' so deep it ain't funny
My beliefs on the back of that money
And I promise I ain't frontin'
I’m just tryna jump up on the track and let 'em know I run it
Yeah buddy, uptown be the place I put on for
Faith got me living risky like I’m going for it on 4th & 11
I ain't talking bout' them Concords, do you want more?
Blake in the paint imma' bang for the cause
Unashamed be the lifestyle more then them tours
Oh Lord he coming back like an encore
If ya' don't know now ya' know boy

[Pre-Hook]
They ain't even know we was out here
They gonna find out what we ‘bout here
Cause everyday we turn up (all day!)
Yeah lights out cause the sun up (i know you see)

[Hook]
And now they know, Now they know
Say now they know, Now they know
Now they know, Now they know
Now they knooooww
Now they know, Now they know (x3)
Now they knooooww yeahhh

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I’m done with hiding
We won’t be denied no more
Now they know
Always on my job
Y'all better check my resume
Numb to all the nonsense
Let’s just call that novocaine
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so RMG
Light of the world when you look at me
Perfecting my King like he made me, never caged me like
Like Cujo, I'm off the le-le-leash
We gon' find the proof it don’t matter who you asking
Ra ra ra ra like a dungeon dragon
Doom doom doom hear the bass beat blastin'
All up in your face, unashamed for the masses

[Verse 4: Tedashii]
Woo! I heard they needed to know my whole crew spittin' truth
Yeah you needed it though
Hold up
Can't keep it closed, that's cruel, it be cold, like the heat was low
Hold up
Yeah this is it, your time baby get up and show ‘em you with us
What burn at the core, like when you doin' sit ups
Unashamed, that's the message that we give 'em
I live it (woo!) til the day that I’m finished
Copy what he did and I’m still authentic, winning (woo!)
H-town my city, put it in the air let me know that you with it
Like mayne, hold up, unashamed with my gang I told ya
My aim, no bane, no soap bruh
In pain, my game, his hope cuz

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
U-N-A-S-H-A-M-E-D we be goin' in
Recognize a real squad when you see mine
Don’t it seem odd that we live our lives to please God
Press pause on a raw explicit (now you tripping)
Unashamed of the truth but unafraid to live it
Still afraid of the leaven though I see my dough rise
One of those guys actin' like nobody know God like I do
Speak my piece, keep my peace
So I ain't gotta keep my piece, capisce?
Click thick like a chain, try to take a link up out it
We ain't unashamed just because we rap about it, nah
We unashamed ‘cause we live it
I'm throwing up the real so they probably catching feelings
Give it away, give it away now, now nah that ain't it
I don't feel them till I hear them holla 116

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook][Hook: Lecrae & Andy Mineo]
Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different?)
Say I won't (why y'all scared to be different, huh?)
Say I won't (we them outsiders, that's just how we live it)
Say I won't (and I bet I will you can)
Say I won't
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
I might do it just to show you
We be like la, la, la, la

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
From the same city as the B-I-G
Wanna serve these bars, gotta see ID
Now I'm on their radar, where B-Dot be
Was a slave for the cars, then we got free
Used to only wanna pull up in a black sport
Just a white man excelling in a black sport
Now I'm really doing pull-ups
Got a honeymoon for the summer tryna get a six-pack for it
Say I won't catch 'Crae slippin' in the studio at like 3 AM
Autograph that forehead with a Sharpie pen and then Instagram
Might swag out a fanny pack
I might bring Velour back
Nobody wanna change the game, man y'all just want more trap?
Okay, say I won't rap over bagpipes
Say I won't talk about that price
To know Christ and live life like every night my last night
'Bout to switch up the program
I rock name-brand, I rock no brand
My whole life GoPro cam, got rap like I had no fans, nope
They say I know I say "veto"
Danny DaVito, and Al Pacino, those are my people
Also I'm rockin' the speedo
This that casino, you bet your revenue
Thinking you'll stop me, no never not letting you
You must be high on that medical thinking I won't
But I know better, know that I bet I do, yup! (kill 'em, ooh)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Say I won't sell my shoes and take my kids to Chuck E. Cheese with the money
Say I won't bring my own bottle of Pellegrino to the movies with me
Say I won't
Look, I'm from an era of fast living and mass terror
Boys covered in cover girls like mascara
I don't need to keep a gun and a mask ever
I still make 'em put their hands up, ask Derek
My road manager damage all of you amateurs
Sneaking up on a tour bus with a demo to hand to us
When I was younger, I just wanted a chain
Now a  chain of events has afforded a change
See, I been a rebel since back in the day, I don't follow the people
I follow the leader through valleys and shadows of death and I fearin' no evil
So say I won't do it, say I won't turn the music up and get to it
Won't come down H-Town all the way to their town
In the old school, drop top Buick
And I'm getting, maybe 8 or 9 miles to the gallon
Still feeling like a stallion
I got Andy riding shotgun with 30 gold chains on, talking about he Italian
Say I won't go drop a double album, and rap double time on all dub-step
Got no producers, just me rocking over beatboxing by Doug E. Fresh
Say I won't

[Hook][Produced by Jimmy Newtron Beats]

[Intro: Wordsplayed]
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Lord have mercy
Got that Martin', yup

[Verse 1: Wordsplayed]
Daddy told me, "Pray for Jimmy Swaggart"
I always did it, I'm just charismatic
I only sip the finest stuff on Earth
This track is hitting hard, I call it Wigglesworth
Can't believe that Andy sold like thirty stacks
I looked at Dre like, "Homie, pass that Martinelli!"
If it sparkles then you know I drink
Mix that cranberry juice so now we're sipping pink
Rapping slow, this track is throwed
Rep the King like it's lamp-mode
New York, my mind state
Malico on that white plate
Rooftop like it's 88
Uptown with my kinfolk
Eastville, where they blow smoke
I sip slow, I don't choke
October 31st, I toast to Martin Luther
December 31st, we pop that Martinelli
Boys's doing shots, my homies didn't blink
Team's down to clown, I got that sparkling drink

[Hook: Wordsplayed]
Pouring up, like the night is ours
Shorties getting turnt at the bridal shower
The beat drop, but they wasn't ready
Champagne glass with the Martinelli
Champagne glass with the Martinelli
Champagne glass with the Martinelli
The beat drop, but they wasn't ready
Champagne glass with the Martinelli

[Verse 2: Wordsplayed]
You know I never got that bottle service
I brought a bottle to the Christmas service
Taylor told me drinking make her nervous
I looked her in the face like, "Girl, just drink that Martinelli"
Thirty empty bottles, ain't nobody faded
You know I'm double-fisting cause my homies made it
Brian hit me like, "Tonight we getting nice!"
I told him, "Bring the buckets," I would bring the ice (I got that!)
Glasses in the air if you's a rider
All my gente on that dancefloor
And they sipping on that cider
Got that 'Nelli in my system
I'm a lover, not a fighter
Say them boys is on that SOSA
Cause them boys is looking light, alright
'Bout to mess around and spend a hundred-fifty
Walk into the store like, "Where the Martinelli?"
I just messed around and spent a hundred-fifty
I'm walking out the store, I got that Martinelli

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Andy Mineo]
I got all my people with me
Wifey says she want a sippy
I know your parents hate the drinking
But it's all good cause this right here's that Martinelli
Uptown at Alex
So much 'Nelli they brought pallets
On my ten, still got balance
And my liver got no damage, no (nada!)
I'm bout that good time homie, no regrets
Shoe game too strong, I don't wanna flex (no flexing!)
Look it, I'm a honeymooner
Me and wifey in Aruba
And we 'bout to hit the scuba
She said, "Take out the trash"
"What I look like, I'm the super?"
She ain't think that's funny
Imma' do it, alright, alright, alright
I got a game plan (tell 'em!)
Leaving in the same car that we came in (tell 'em!)
When that 'Nelli's in the system
Ain't no telling if we twisted or we isn't
They be yelling out...

[Hook: Wordsplayed & Andy Mineo]
Pouring up, like the night is ours
Shorties getting turnt at the bridal shower
The beat drop, but they wasn't ready
Champagne glass with the Martinelli[Hook]
This body's not mine it's yours it's yours it's yours
So everyday I'm fighting a war
To flee from it all till I'm free from it all (2x)

[Verse 1: KB]
Ok saved at an early age
In thirty days, it felt like I had managed to murdered most of my worldly ways
Worldly ways? But a couple stayed and coupled with a couple years
I'm wondering am I had missed out on the thrills I had thrown away
Was all this in vain? Strain to remain and refrain
And sustain through this flame in my veins
Lust is his name, this virgin a burden
I ain't never hit the club maybe I just need a taste
A lil' taste, a lil' taste is like a little rape
A lil' drank, a poison but can it kill a mayne?
A heard them say without sex life is a waste
But Christ is over all I kept my pants on my waste
Turned beautiful chicks away, dudes swearin' that I'm lame
Though I got a sex drive the Spirit's holding the brakes
There's no breaks this is His infinite work
Content with my rib nothing is sweet enough to desert her

[Interlude]
See some of y'all done bought the lie
That sex is what makes you a man
But that's not what makes you a man
Anybody can go lay with a woman
What makes you a man is being defined
By who you say you are in Christ
If you have Christ you have all that you need
Everything you need is bound up in the resurrected Savior

[Verse 2: PRo]
Look can I be real with you
They say that women want attention that's the real issue
And if they only wore dresses just a little bit longer
Then the flesh that I be feeding wouldn't burn like a sauna
Wait is that the reason why your brain is in chains?
When you at home by yourself in front of computer screens
Or is that the reason why sick men prey on
Little girls in school still playing with crayons
No! It's the flesh that all men should fight
While Satan persist to tempt us with our own wicked delights
See God made intimacy to glorify He
The flesh wanna do as we please glorify we
That girl is not an object for playing
That's a woman not a barbie I don't care what Nicki say
And just like her sex is God's creation
You spit inside his face when you don't use it how he made it

[Interlude]
Sex is a gift from God but we've taken it and made it idolatry
We've taken it and put it in the place of God
And we worship it and so it comes out in all kinds of profane ways
And so we blame the women for what they're wearing
And we blame the media for what they're producing
But we never blame ourselves
For how we've twisted God's gift to glorify us

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Flesh on the rise like the tide when I go surfing
You can see just what I prize in my life when I go searching
Roaming with my eyes; no surprise sin is lurking
Get's me every time and inside man I'm hurting
Pretending that I'm fine but it's a lie man I'm burdened
Cause what's inside is never satisfied so I serve it
Afraid of getting caught so I hide I'm so nervous
Scared that I may die begging Christ to reverse it
Lord you are the gospel such a bad scene
Even if I clear my history my past ain't clean
And I can try clean it up but it never seems enough
I trust myself then hurt myself fail this is tough
I need the gospel clear see my sin for what it is
One brings life the other death man to me plus my kids
Selfish in my ways and it's go'n put me in the grave
But Christ can save and set you free no longer be enslaved

[Bridge]
My spirit willing but my flesh weak
This moment is but a test see
Lord you're greater than all these pleasures
I just wanna see you as my treasure
God I wanna
Flee from it all till I'm free from it all (4x)

[Interlude]
Manning up is not just managing your sexual temptations
It's not just managing your sin that's not what it means to be a man
Because you can try harder and you can do better
And you can hang on longer that's not manning up
Manning up is our ability to lay down all of our effort
And all of our trying and all of our strength and say I trust in Jesus
I trust in his perfection I trust in his power I trust in his ressurection
Because he's the only one that can get me through this
And he's the only one that can make me free[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
What you wanna do, act loco?
Hit 'em with the old to the flow that I grew up on
Then I grew up on
And funny now how I flow for Hova, heh
Words twisted, but yo, I'm sober
Never really been the type to pour up
When I get this thing going I don't like to slow up
Mouth movin' like a motor when I bite the flow up
But I bet they won't stop, let me go, let me go
Imma show off every ability God's giving me to go off in
Nobody mad about the beauty of the Vatican and the tabernacle
So when I'm rappin' you can add it in
Breakin' 'em with the shatter
They're gonna wanna put me in a place with paddin'
And Imma damage 'em every time like a player that's on the cover of Madden
God, the original
We bright, look out!

[Hook: Andy Mineo] (x2)
I feel like I'm Paganini
Who? Paganini

[Verse 2: KB]
Lemme do it
K to the second letter, finna get it
Poppin', comin' out the pocket like, ooh
Everybody get to rockin' doin' the Paganini
Killin' the beat, my tongue is like a violin
Give it to 'em like I'm not a human
When I'm doing what I'm doing
Keepin' it comin' like an automatic shooter
When we get to rippin' it ridiculous
And everybody gets to speakin' about these driven brothers that's goin' in again
But they don't know even when they got that flow
I don't know why they boast, everybody's gifts borrowed
Look, producers, directors, skilled architectures
Do what they do to whom they're connected
True was the God that chooses to bless them
Who is the one you think they reflectin'?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canon]
So down for my clique, shut up (y'all corny)
Oh shoot, shut up
I've been itchin' to stick 'em up with this killer Canon
Comin' to cut 'em and hit 'em harder, ooh, kill 'em!
Hold up, I've been hittin' everything up in me like I'm Paganini
Hittin' every rhythm like a milli chopped ya
I know you heard Twista, and Tech-a-Nina hittin' ya
But Canon's original, Imma Midwest monster, kill 'em!
Blat! Blat! Mineo and Kevin got adrenaline
Comin' to drill 'em with the real gospel
Coming up to the game
Still the same, bigger the name, bigger the fame
To the glory they follow Him and the Father
While I'm comin' and killin' the game
I'm breakin' 'em off and we know
They steady tryna imitate the steelo
I'm hittin' with fire, spittin' super wild
Runnin' with the young and unashamed
I'm Paganini on a kilo, amigo

[Hook]

[Outro: AnointedS]
Show off[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Yeah all I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
(repeat x2)

[Verse 1: KB]
(UH K to the second)
I be feeling like Jackie Robinson
Rocking the 42 in my dodger fit
Gripping the arm that was just took by a pitch
Crowd the opposite saying that I should quit but I done threw all of it
You can hate but you can't hurt me
You can hate but you can't hurt me
And my worth is safe I can leave this earth today
Gassed up on grace how they gon' circle K
I don't want no new Bugatti
Put me in Nimba County
Liberia I'm serious
Mosquito net and my Bible
Concrete bed I'm still smiling
Ain't eating much but I'm smiling
I'd rather be in the jungle and in the will of God
Then anywhere else outside it
Boy, I'm Bout It
I'm in this life
But my hope ain't in this life
A good career book for years, I book them peers
A good look just won't suffice
But homie my life is hidden in Christ
My life is hidden in Christ
Gimme 99 problems plus one Godhead
The result is

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KB]
OK, our God's never failing
Ain't nothing you can tell Him
Yes He's the generous type
But you face Him you will take that L in
No our God won't fail us
We know from where our help comes
So I put my life at stake
Though it might be blood I want that well done (100)
If we flipping burgers if we flipping houses
Man our bank accounts don't mean nothing
And if we paid a lot or if we paid a bit
We gon' be going in cause He's coming
We tryna be the best that we can be
And rest so that the world can see that He's done it
No matter who cuts the checks or where we working at
Man we work for Him and we love it

[Hook]

[Outro: KB]
I just wanna hear that
Well done my faithful servant
A life full of push back
At that moment will all be worth it
Cause my work is worship
And when He comes back for His church all over the earth
We'll be given no less than what He gave us first
100Welcome to my classroom
I'm the orator for the moment let's use this backroom
Now feel free to take notes on this lecture
Save your questions for the end, may I begin
Well, first the dilemma
Everybody wanna shine like a diamond
Nobody wants to go through that pressure
It takes, time, refinement and push the miles for excellence
If a rapper tries to sum me I guess you can call me Oedipus
Kill 'em
I am hip hop's four elements
With a touch of heaven sent, let me address them elephants
Is he Latino?
He seems to be lacking melanin
When I black out on that microphone all that chatter's irrelevant
Stadium packed out
We rap about everything we wanna
Yada Yada [?]
On a scale of 1-10, one-sixteen til He come again
On a mission with this pen I ain't missing
Listen, I feel like
King David who just slayed the Goliath
Holding his head high while these haters remain quiet
Shhh, I ain't lying but you ain't gotta believe me
It's something you've never seen like what's under Sway's beanie
Call me the game genie
Sort of feel like I'm cheating
There's more to like than chiefing and going out every weekend
I'm treating this beat like a piece of meat that needs to be eaten
Men move out of conviction, not out of convenience

I ain't trying to preach to the choir
I’m trying to reach in the fire
We got war overseas but got no peace in the shower
And they wonder why these kids gotta rob, huh?
Cause you can get a gun faster than you can get a job
Pressure applied
I ain't puffing a lie
I'm already with the Most High, write my bars as I fly, meaning
Travel so much got status on every airline
Til I'm far back, LeBron's hairline

Carolina blue tips chillin' on them 14s
Had them back when I was little sort of like that rapper from New Orleans
Only sure thing in life is your death
I pray these rappers know that dude who's hanging on their neck
Yeah, I know Him well, so I ain't even stressed
If Kim Jong was taking photos it wasn't posing a threat, nah
I'm engaged now so I tell them ladies later
Quit hitting on me like Solange in the elevator

You know what I tell a hater?
Nothing, it doesn't bother me
Honestly I'm an Anomaly breaking them off properly
Why these second string rappers trying to start with me
I'm an organ donor but nobody want no parts of me
All about that blood like I hit an artery
This that Jesus talk, you don't wanna see me start?
Well you better send somebody to martyr me
It's Uptown![Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Listen, I'm the rock town presidente, kid
Uptown where they sippin' presidentes, it's
The E, to the M-I
Sit in the back of the redeye plane
The way that I'm living you better
Be getting my ass in the penthouse suite
Ain't no leasing, no, I need to own
I put a bitch on silent, just like a cheater's phone
Hush! Nobody want to hear it
We gonna run up in your crib with a bunch of kings and they fully bearded
They half Hispanic and Half American, fully arrogant
I was born to a virgin homie, I know my heritage
Single mother, I don't know what a marriage is
I ain't heard from God or my father, I think they both abandoned us
The game is made up of a bunch of bitches
Cuz all I see is a hundred zeroes doing zero to a hundred mixes
No unconditional love, homie, there's one condition
I need a moment of silence after I'm fucking finished
Bang!

[Verse 2: Dreezy]
Let me go and kill it one time
I been thumbing through the paper like the Sun Times
I look inocent when I wear my bobs and weaves
But the way I bob and weave
You get flatlined by a punchline
These niggas ain't the greatest like Scotty Pippen
I feel like the truth and I mean more than the definition
I got the heat that'll make LeBron come back
They come to Dreez for the spins: I'm a laundromat
You bring that beef like burgers, we'll body your five guys
I'm a dog but I be living life like I got 9 lives
Rappers want me on the track, but askin' if I got a verse to send
Just in case they want to go and write their verse again
It's evident my intelligence got them jealous
They tell me I got potential, I feel like they need development
I body rappers and leave them there with a skeleton
Felon, but I ain't telling I'm ending veterans' relevance

[Verse 3: Dillon Cooper]
Yo, I'm bringing it back, because my flow's tight
I break bars quicker than body parts
You get cracked with a chrome pipe
Same hustler's on my block since I was a youngin
Used to call me Tony Hawk cause I was skatin' instead of thuggin'
And that's word life
My tongue switch words like white chicks with scoliosis
Giving [?] in the back of the whip on the turnpike
Dark Knight, fix you a knuckle sandwich that's on site
Don't play yourself homey, man I'm the wrong type
To mess with
Blow your candles out, that's a death wish
Introspection, De La Soul said I'm next, man
[?] killer monumental [?]
Could be Nas' apprentice
Oh see my knowledge complex like forensics
You can't compare my style to no nigga
My steez Versace, and y'all Forever 21 like gold diggers
So knuckle up, if you think that you can hang
And if not, then let me do my thing

[Verse 4: Jace Two-9]
I was off [?] Sunday morning with a thirty
Crosses on my denim
[?] got me feeling holy
Hustled on me rolley
So fuck what the teachers told me
Hood nigga out in Beverly Hills, Axel Foley
Came down like rain how these girls see me they wet
In H-town with a [?] now, pipe down cause I'm next
This way or a that a way
You madder than a hatter, say
Boondock saint, cause I said later with the latter day
I can make your girl [?] sing Donnie Hathaway
She no answer when her phone ring, cause she banging me
Like she Uncle Ben
Ask my nines, any girl I'm with a fucking ten
I said I'm either going off or I'm going in
I said I'm either doing dope or I'm counting ends
Joey, Rachel, Chandler, Ross, we just fucking friends
Now she want to touch again
After that I'm gonna pass her back, like I'm Peyton Man
[?] uber-maneuver how we gonna move
Finally call Johnny and tell him it's time to move now
Fiends hold the weed, them coppers we acting too wild
Bust a rhyme, we the leaders of the new school now
With this mic I will [?] just for me and mine
Pockets flexed up no creatine
Man, where I'm at? Boy I'm sipping shine
Pour 4-4's, Mike Jones, man I'm sipping fine
I'm a giver, flexing up, sipping wine
Only hit Lennox up for jeans and a finish line
Don't worry about me or my life of crime
Girl is bad as Rita Ora for oral at dinner time

[Verse 5: Conceited]
Young tatted nigga, who fly as fuck
Whip got hoes in it like a fire truck
Why would I not bring the cash out
When the shoes cost a bando like a trap house
Nothing but gold on a nigga
I don't deal with sterling, I'm so like the Clippers
I'm a spitter, rhyming with these bars
I'm in a class by myself like a retard
Spent cheese on hi-tops, I got guap
The way I'm balling haters wish I had a shot clock
I don't deal with short stacks, I ain't IHOP
Money like Visine, see what I drop?
My Glock is on me, though
Here to pop a nigga like the Maury show
And she like Comcast, cause she on demand
Cause I'm balling like a bitch, Juwanna Mann

[Verse 6: Andy Mineo]
Mama said I was headed for prison, causing mischief
Doing what I saw on television, I
Wanted that KFC living, you know
Riding around with a biscuit in a bucket with a couple chickens
What would you do if I told you that [?] was true religion?
You would probably ask me how they fit in
It's cool if you searching for God, then y'all with it
But the moment you said you found Him
All the sudden you tripping
I think God's giving all these rappers all this
To make them think about the lyrics they recorded
They like "Look back at it. Look back."
It's cool until your baby girl's on the other side of that statement
Uptown they be puffing on the marley
Sipping on the latest like the car's so tardy
And corporations want money off of hip hop
That's why you get a Kendrick doll with your Barbie
That's that [?] my team winning
One sixteen we so storming they don't know us cause, uh
We been in the cut, that's neosporin, get familiar
We doper than a kilo of that foreign
And I'm feeling like I'm Jordan from that free throw
Dunking on this beat, though
Flowing on December go get your pico
Go ahead keep the ego stuff to yourself
Paint the big picture then rap the easel[Andy Mineo]
Yeah, he's still alive
He's still breathing
The sun is shining
Yeah, what's the meaning
He shoulda died last night
C-c-c-c-catch someone capped in here
They extra clear
But his vodka was
He had sex in bed and he got that buzz, ah
One day he gonna exit here
And before he go
He gotta find out if there's anything more
Than what he had been living for
We got them

[Co Campbell]
Eyes open
Take a deep breath
Another day I've been kept
Another day I've never seen
Never every vision
Did I ask a lot in my dreams
As I get out that bed
Pull back them blinds
The sun is shinin'
Down on, down on me
I can feel His glory, glory
Shinin' down, down on me

[Hook: Co Campbell]
I, I must be here for a reason
Another day that I'm alive, yeah
There's a reason I'm still breathin', yeah
Another day I survived
So as long as I'm alive
I'mma live the best way
I'mma live my best days
I don't care what the people say
As long as I'm alive
I'mma live the right life
With God on my side
Errything gonna be a'ight
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, ay
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Errything gonna be a'ight
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, ay
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Errything gonna be a'ight

[Co Campbell]
Problems come, problems go
But you'll live to see another day, you'll never know
Tomorrow's not promised, so be grateful when another day is given to you

[Hook]

[Andy Mineo]
Yeah
Che, It's funny how death clarifies life
You lose somebody then gain insight
But bags are light
My heart is heavy
I'm travelling that world saying get ready
Put one in the air if ya ever lost one
Wish ya said goodbye but more time falls done
On that death bed was the most important
Them closed imported, I owe the Lord
Hopin' on before the days out
Countin' days, I make the days count like

[Co Campbell]
Show the people hope
Show the people faith
Give them inspiration on how to live from day to day
(x3)[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Look, more of the same
I'm cornered gain
Back and forth, forth and back
With the names recording pain
You played back, when them insecurities rang
And I ain't even gotta answer, but the question remain
Uhh
Why everything inside of my brain, not applied
It's insane, but yo I'm trying to change
Decided to ditch my strength and rely on the King
Mama said at the end of yourself is where it begin
So I'm, totally free embracing my limitations
Wishing my heart move at the same pace of this information
Uhh
I pray this ain't strange
What I'm saying but I'm trying
To find a back door to your imagination
I'm here, let me in to be clear
I'm bringing something make you wonder
Who's the one that gave the gifts that I bear
What happen next
I think about it, do you ever?
I can give you an answer but a question do you better like...

[Hook: Dimitri McDowell]
Have you ever loved
The treasures of this world
When it's insanity?
Cause it's killing me
Have you ever tried to be something you're not?
Cause I've been searching for security
Oh na na na
His love is all we got

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
I'm trying to go from selfish to selfless
Not just thinking bout my needs but someone else's
All these pretty women in my city isn't helping
No matter how hot that body one day it's melting, yo
A good lie got a little truth in it
So I'm trying to decide what's real and embellished
The money coming in so everybody's good fellas
I don't trust em, no phone numbers
Tell em e-mail us
Can you tell?
I've been affected by this industry
Numbers and CD sales, what the heck has gotten into me?
I had to ask myself, what's a win for me?
Do I worship God or what other people think of me?
Sobering thoughts depleting my hot air
Thinking 'bout this world when I'm not here
Will I treasure money or the moments that we share?
It's funny how, seeing death can make life so clear
I got a girlfriend, but so long it feels weird
It's not like "Yo, can I get to know you?"
More like, "Meet my parents"
I think I'm scared cause it's serious
And every time I tell somebody they tryna to marry us, pump the brakes
I think I love her but them words ain't been said still
Cause last time I did things didn't end well
Plus plus my past was hashtag been trill
It's time to grow up, you know what?
I ain't trying to be another bum that's just scared of committing
Take everything from these women then go missin'
I gotta kill the wicked part of my heart that keeps pimpin'
If I ain't got the strength
Then I know where to get it
You live different when you know you've been forgiven
His love is forever, don't you ever forget it
You live different when you know you've been forgiven
His love is forever, don't you ever forget it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Dimitri McDowell]
Please speak your mind, I'm wide open
Love you for you girl, let it be hard girl
Lay it on the line, tell me all your questions
I promise I won't judge you, try not to judge me

[Hook][Intro] (x7)
Never bored

[Verse 1]
Gnarly
Never bored, but I got a board
That I put on all fours, and kick it on smooth floors
It's with me on tours, even ride it on stages
Red's in the wheels, but I wasn't set claiming
Clicked up, we ain't tryna' be famous
People don't get it, they don't know just what the aim is - dangerous
What you gon' say, it's a man who been changed
Who know that to die is they gain?
Yeah! You know what it's like, you know what it's like?
Getting ready for the moment, getting ready for the night
But I'm getting ready for that moment, where my faith will be sight
What's the point of getting fly, if you ain't ready for the flight?
Ha!
From the sight, from the one I follow
Dudes find bravado at the bottom of a bottle
Until they got they face twisted up like a fossil
There's another way to live
You ain't got to know somebody; tell em!

[Hook x2]
Say ayo!
Come and kick it with the team
The party's over here
Let me show you what I mean
We saying
Say ayo

I'm on that 1-16
Homie come get it right
Show you what the clique like
Show you what the clique like

[Verse 2]
Corey told me ‘bout the matrix
Not that I'm about it
I don't bang with the same set that I used to claim
See look it I ain't famous, some people know my name though
I just wan' remain low, so that that I don't take it to the brain, brain
Catch me underground on the train ridin' slow
That's where I compose, all my wickedest flows
Being from New York, oh it can have it's pros
And it's con Edison's bills high like the smoke is
Some are uptown, it's like an expo
Like some exposed skin, like a triple x show
Me and my dogs mean, we don't need a vet though
But my flesh be itchin’
Get it, you starting I'm trying to finish
Enjoying gods gifts, you know what the dish
Up in Barbados, they made us through flyin' fish
Even all around the world
Me and the whole clique
Unashamed everywhere
They holla' 1-1-6

[Hook]

[Outro x7]
Never bored

[Hook][Hook: Andy Mineo]
I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just gon' lose my soul?
And my ways ain't purified, don't live according to Your Word
I can't endure this life without Your wisdom being heard
So word to every dancer for a pop star
Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rockstar
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright
So let me fall back, stop giving my suggestions
Cause when I follow my obsessions, I end up confessing
That I'm not that impressive, matter of fact
I'm who I are, a trail of stardust leading to the superstar

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I had a dream that I was captain of my soul
I was master of my fate, lost control, and then I sank
So I don't want to take the lead, cause I'm prone to make mistakes
All these folks who follow me, gon' end up in the wrong place
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, cause I only trust in me
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, You know what's in my hand
Me, I just roll and trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is You the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background, like it's an instrument

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lecrae]
I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really glorify Your name?
And it's a shame, the way I want to do these things for You, yet
Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from You
Seems You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's cause she never heard of this

[Hook 2x][Chorus: Andy Mineo]
I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead, lead, lead
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead, lead, lead
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just going lose my soul
And my ways ain't pure if I don't live according to Your Word
I can't endure this life without Your wisdom being heard
So word, to every dancer for a pop star
Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rock star
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright
So let me fall back, stop giving my suggestions
Cause when I follow my obsessions, I end up confessing

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really Glorify Your name

Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from You
It seems You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's cause she never heard of this

[Chorus] (x2)[Hook: Beleaf & Andy Mineo] (x2)
I need my bass loud and my mic up
I'm turning my life up
It's quiet out there
And I'mma turn it up

[Verse 1: Beleaf]
I think I might snap off like Thi'sl
Spazz out like Lecrae
Pass out like Uncle Reece, zone out like KB
Or be excellent like the Humble Beast
I got a recipe for success, Beleaf is no celebrity
But I celebrate with the Huxtables for longevity
I do whatever it takes to get better
Raising my kids in a Cosby sweater
When I was young that was all I had
To get me through the bad weather
That was wholesome TV, now it's all about chasing cheddar
We went from Winnie the Pooh to Honey Boo-Boo
Come on man we gotta get it together

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
My bass up and my mic loud
Live shows, I'm wild
They say white men can't jump, how?
I'm flying into that nice crowd
I'm swagging and I'm surfing
And I hope the body get hurt
Them black girls mad
Cause they perm is messed up from the soak that I'm squirting, sorry
Pulling up in that party, McFlyer than Marty
Oh you got the Ferrari car, the latest like it's tardy
I ain't hating, nah, congratulations
I'm just here to say if you're waiting
For that whip to give you a sense of worth
Well I hope you got some patience, heh
Come and kick it with the team, we like "Ayo!"
Jesus be like Simon, Imma do it if he say so
I be fighting him but can't say no
He molding me, I don't play though
Yeah I'm looking for a wife
So girl lets keep it real, Te'o
Yeah they asking how my queso stack like lettuce and tomato
I take 808s and eat 'em like it's steak and then potatoes
Nowaday the radio be sounding dumb, Cuba Gooding
Yeah I rock that ugly sweater
Boy the proof is in the pudding

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beleaf]
They like, "boy turn down that ruckus"
I'm like, "The Breax is here, you can't touch us!"
Go ape in here or get replaced in here
They either kick us out or unplug us
So I let my light shine like high beams
Turn it up 'til it's blinding
So they can't see out their rearview
Say it loud so they hear you
When you know the truth, but it scares you
So you hide in those dark places
And I came to shine the light
So don't try to hide your faces
Riding clean, don't mistake us
Even though we took a different route
We still guaranteed to turn it up
So we can blow the speakers out

[Hook]

[Outro]
You know, the proof is in the pudding, dah
The chocolate pudding pops
Jello[Intro]
Gettin money, Gettin' Gettin money(x2)
"It's all about the Benjamins baby"
Is it really now?

[Hook]
What y'all wanna do
Wanna be ballers?
Shot-callers? Brawlers?
[X2]

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I know some dudes up on my block
Push that green to make that guap
They so paranoid they hear a noise
They fear for all they got
Tell me, is this life? I think not
What's money if you don't got peace homey?
They tell me 'What's life if you just can't eat"
So preacher don't preach at
Me, homey
I'm ain't against you, I'm for you
I'm just another young boy who
Found
Grace, mercy, and joy
I want you to know joy too
That's why I want to be
Honest
And tell you
In the dollars you're never gonna find it
Peace is too big to fit up in your wallet
But you wanna be fly, Mister Co-Pilot?
I know the television promised
If you get it then you gonna be good
But
Stop it
Tell me what a man profits
If he gains the world
But loses his
Soul in the process?
I know you heard it all before
But the words cut deep
Because them words
From the Sword
All for Pete sake
Call that a cliché
I call them dull ears
That don't hear what we say
I'd hate to see you fresher
Than some Listerine
With two girls like Mr. Sheen
You bald out like Mr. Clean
Your life passed & you missed the meaning
Aw man
Don't miss it
If you flirting with death
Don't kiss it
You extra fresh and you ready to go out
But you ain't ready to go out
Money is good, but don't spell it with one "o"
What's the score? Jesus:1 Death:0
But they tellin' me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich Perez]
Let's keep it straight like a toupé
He kept his word, touché
So we applaud like "Hooray"
We reppin' the name, we keep it the same, we do it again and again
We doing it all unashamed
I'm keeping my hands up, never about the Benjamins, nay!
That stuff fades like a haircut, but he died without dark spots on his body like a leopard, so...
Now the reason we all going in, brother:
We got the Spirit of the King, Romans 10:9
My confession: I know I'm His
Saved - co-heir, no error kid
He the head like New Era lids
Why you chasing after things that be perishin'?
I am rich - He's the treasure
So I share the wealth, it's my pleasure

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Izz]
Yo, show me where your hundreds is, show me where your stacks at
Show me what's your treasure and I'll show you where your heart is at
Racks on racks, I've got plenty stacks
But it ain't on earth cause ain't no ceiling where my Daddy's at
I got a crew spittin' Jesus in the speakers
Not worried 'bout the fame or the crease up in the sneakers
At work ain't got no feet up
In the word cause you gotta read up
When we be coming up empty, boy, you know it's time to re-up
But the world keep tellin' me to make that dough
Get it while I got it cause it ain't that low
Everybody do it, they won't know
But I got the calling and it ain't gon' blow
And I'mma show you why the paper never coincides with the sinful nature
Ask the Savior, He say "Sho' you right"
I make it plain, boy, I can live without 'em
Cause it's up in that name that I know I'll never doubt Him
And I'll invest it cause my money's all about Him
Rather need money with Him than have them hundreds without Him

[Hook x2][Intro]
You didn't know I was proud of you up there singing, huh?
You don't want your father to see you? Huh, C-Lite?
Come on, man. You're supposed to call me! What's the matter with you, huh?
You don't like me no more? You tell Mark you're here, but you don't call your dad
Alright, give your dad a call. Bye

[Hook]
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter
So take it all away

[Verse 1]
Anybody know the feeling of rejection?
Feels like you was kicked in your midsection
When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend
Everybody play the game of love you, you 'bout to bench him
You start thinking she's chillin' with other men, and you gettin' jealous
Start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment
I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter
Go skeeming on Twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses
Bitterness can make a heart numb, but hope is like a star
You don't see it shine bright until the dark come
So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug
If I got unforgiveness in my heart
Then there really ain't no room for love
Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven
That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen,
But I know my sins removed since Jesus came
With no reason to forgive me, but He did, so I do the same

[Break 1]
Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense
But bitterness is a choice

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yea, I gotta tread softly
Don't wanna be a hypocrite
Plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me
Where should I start?
Well, I feel like I'd be sorta frontin' to say
When my father calls that I don't hit ignore button
It's probably cause we never kicked it at a younger age
I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved
I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest
All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college
I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter
It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner
And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins
When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him
His power in such amazing love like
When Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross
As he was hanging from it
Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son
Remove the roots of bitterness
Don't stop until your work is done

[Break 2]
God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive
Let me see my own sin

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1 - Tedashii]
You ain’t got it like that
Sorry I’m the one that gotta drop it like that
People play a part now you gotta act
I ain’t going for it you can stop it where it’s at
(2x)
Faith ends well
They pretend well
But that never ends well
Fail
Never ends well
Please, excuse my escape
Who can I run to when everybody fake
I ain’t usually impatient but I just couldn’t wait
Really wasn’t sure how much more I could take
Frontin’, like they really off something
When they really nothin, everybody stuntin
Like they in the movie but they not in the credit
Dyin to be remembered
(Forget ‘em)

[Hook – Andy Mineo]
Is this a fantasy, land
I don’t think I know where I am
But then again (who really knows)
Is this a fantasy, land
I don’t think I know where I am
But then again
Why don’t you catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
Why don’t you catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
(Until then)

[Verse 2 - Tedashii]
Mister, he the keeper
Chief chiefa with cheeba under your seata
Keeper, you keepa
Model diva like Rama Decomacita
Keep the deceive a diva that kiss just below your sneakers
(I don’t believe you people!)
Low down dirty
So clown worthy
I take you as a joke I’m not trying to provoke just shock
As I watch people come to us not
And the crowd goes wild while a smile still in shock
We run to the place with familiar faces
Cope with my pain and conceal in anguish
I burryin my soul like in the garden naked
Aware of my flaws and it’s hard to take it
My image in the mirror it’s hard to face it
We all lost perfection we chose to replace it
Tryin to remember but somebody erased it
Now all I know is I’m tryin to escape it
Picture perfect art till it’s hung kinda odd
Framed in my pain and it’s hung kinda off
Tryna get it straight but I can’t ‘cause it’s hard
Hidin in the bushes I don’t want to get caught

[Hook]

[Outro - Tedashii]
People claim I broke laws but who really knows
Chippin' Paint with this Shawshank who really knows
People claim I broke laws but who really knows (who really knows)
(Why don’t you catch me if you can)
(2x)[Intro: for KING & COUNTRY]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Why waste my breath singing words of praise
That are filled with myself? Who's greater?
What love do I have that you didn't give
Cause all that I am is a product of grace
And what should I trust, your love for me
Or my love for you? Who's greater?

[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
I'm caught dreaming
Of someone greater than me
Who cut the sea
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The blood on Your tree is saving me
I'm caught dreaming

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much
What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed
How in spite of how I fail to do what you command to
Serve other gods like Baal, you never bail
That's illogical devotion, could it really be
You chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me
You never left me, even when the darkest days began
Nor forget me, only thing you're forgetting is my sin
I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful
All because you're faithful to me, yeah, I'm grateful
My mistakes can never stop the choice you make to adopt me
The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me

[Hook]

[Bridge: for KING & COUNTRY]
I could sing how I love you, love you
But your love for me is much greater
And I could sing how I love you, love you
But your love for me is much greater

[Hook][Intro: for King & Country]
I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming (x3)) (x3)

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]

And what should I trust, your love for me

[Hook: Marz Ferrer & for King & Country]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And I like singing (ohhh)
A burning tree speaking to me
I'm caught dreaming
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty (ohhh)
The blood on Your tree is saving me
I'm caught dreaming

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo & Marz Ferrer & for King & Country]
Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much

[Bridge: Marz Ferrer & for King & Country]
I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming (x3))
Yeah, I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming)
I could sing how I love you
But your love is much greater
And I could sing how I love you
But your love is much greater
I'm dreaming
I could sing how I love you, love you
But your love is much greater
And I could sing how I love you, love you
But your love is greater
I'm dreaming (oh dreaming) (x4)
Oh Dreaming (x4)
I'm caught dreaming (I'm caught dreaming (x3))[Verse 1]
Rap is such a competitive sport
And my glasses still on, it's the incredible dork
They wanna try me like the federal court
But I'm unashamed of the gospel I'll never retort
That statement, other rappers are wack sauce
DJ treat em like Mr. Miyagi and turn they wax-off
Reaching God's standards we all fall short
Like tryna' shoot a medicine ball from half court
Dissing God? Well you better abort
It don't go well for you, that's hell for you
I'm telling you all, I don't want to see you perish
But you wanna ball so hard like them Ninjas In Paris, kawasaki
They wanna put me in a box like Rocky cause I talk about God
But not me Papi let me keep it honest like I had too much sake
Some people say I'm cocky I just know that God got me

[Hook]
Some say I'm cocky, I just know that God got me

[Verse 2]
Feasting on God's word, chop it up properly
Watch me put it down raw like hibachi
Uptown New York City where you can spot me
Somebody told me I'm the only thing that can stop me
Never will I grow beyond a servant
Snakeskin on a strapback but I'm free from the serpent
Everybody worship even if you're not churchin'
What your living for is God, power, pleasure or your job
Some livin' for they clothes, call it True Religion
Y'all ain't tryna hear me like them demos I be getting
I think they get the memo, the Christians in the building
And they been getting higher than the Keisha that you're twisting
Y'all know how to get it, encounters with the Most High
You don't need to blow loud, come and get to know Jah
I'll introduce you to Supplier, cause He don't want your deeds boy He wants your desires
It's hard to spit fire when you hardly get inspired by the genre you're inside of
Everybody wanna try to be something they not, well guess what do you
I'm still covered in that blood like SuWoo

[Hook][Verse 1: KB]
Goin' in like my first name is holiday
Looking to lose, I already gave it all away
To the Father, you see that money got a mean fade away
Leave you with Pennies and a Hardaway
My motto stay, on that imago dei
Me and my God finna ride on some all the way
The power of the gospel, many will die today
Then come alive, putting faith in the God who reigns

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Falling, lifeless, livin’ dead, no Michael Myers
Dead end, dead end, dead wrong liar liar
Life lookin’ bad so I took my vision higher
Focus off of me when he came and crossed my wires
Cleared off, come alive, no more asking who am I
My identity, infinity, which means I won’t expire
Truth got me goin’ wild, if you out there in the crowd
And you feel this in your soul, then that mean you gettin’ loud, get it?

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
Minor, I’m where they merk you for a couple grand
Look at the surface, the walking dead, the zombie land
That’s why some people say they’ll never trust the church again
‘Cause these preachers ridin’ clean and they don’t even care
What if our heart stop? Then I guess this the defibullator
And the only thing we preach, the blood of Christ, he’s the one that made us
And I ain’t got no hidden agenda when I rap boy, so hi hater
Come alive now, you ain’t gon’ have time later

[Hook]
Man you ever seen a dead man walking?
Every place he lays his head is a coffin
Deaf to the truth, blind to the light
He think he livin’, he ain’t ever seen life
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
And come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Wake up

[Verse 4: Andy Mineo]
Yeah! Nothing safe ‘round here
My faith is touching everything (everything?) Yeah
I was bought with a price, so my life ain’t my own
If you walk with the Christ, it’s more than just Sunday morning
It’s how I live on the Rock, how you talk to your wife
It’s how I live when I’m home when I cut off the lights
How I’m spending my dough, that’s when my heart is exposed
Am I generous with it, or do I never let go?

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
Man these boys is young, wild, and reckless, scheming on the neck-a-lace
Teachers tell them they’ll never be nothing but a detriment
While you looking past them, they headed for the casket
I’m trying to show ‘em love, why you mad about my tracklist?
You white washed tombs, yeah I hear you quoting Spurgeon
If you ain’t out here loving them, then what’s the point of learning?
Them widows and them orphans, girls having abortions
You prob’ly can't see ‘em, you’re too high up on your horses

[Verse 6: Trip Lee]
You claim to live it up, you’re living for the moment
But you’re dead boy, I smell you decomposing
And we was dead too, so we don’t wanna leave ya homie
‘Cause them reapers placed to keep, your eyes ain’t even open
I got some news for ya, the best you’ve ever heard
The Son died, then came back alive on the third
And He can resurrect you, all you gotta do is say the word
And you can take my word for it, he raised me out that dirt

[Hook][Intro: SPZRKT]
Look for the stars
Look for the roaming crowd
And I will not be there
Look for the roses
They love me, they didn't
And I'm still a misfit

[Intro: Andy Mineo]
Come together like a hundred different strands
Wanna make God laugh well just tell Him your plans

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Oooh! That's right (that's right)
My life sorta like a Coogi sweater
Oooh! That's right
My life like a Coogi Sweater

[Verse 1: MartyMar]
Started rapping with my boys as a hobby
Driving to the mall freestyling in a car seat
Homie, I never ever thought that I'd be here
Went from sitting all alone to a beach chair
Homie, what I look like tryna get approval
All these funny looking rappers in their cool clothes
Independent rappers touring off of TuneCore
And I'll be repping Misfit Gang to my funeral
This is how it goes and I know it's so beautiful
Cause to be doing what I'm doing it's unusual
And if I didn't mention God I'd be stupid though
(Cause, literally, he's amazing so... uuh)
This is how I'm living tryna finish up an album
Gotta hustle everyday never had a how come
Two years before they were asking were you found em'
I feel like Wu-Tang, '93 Shaolin
I just wanna live young, party with my misfits
Always was a stand out never tried to fit in
And I'm a do me, I never try to give in
Everybody got a co-sign, we're the ones who didn't homie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Fernie shot a text with the dragon face (ERR!)
So I hit him with the whales
Me and my lady doing real good
Young boy bout to take a trip to Zales, that's trill!
Never ever thought that I would settle down
Every other city I was running round, shutting down stages
Places and states with amazing ladies
But after all that I found my favorite
White boy with the black gauges
Growing up I didn't have belts I had laces
Mamma working overnight never did the day shift, bat life
Now I live the rap life, how the heck he made it?
Aw! Scratching on their head like they had lice
Now I gotta catch the last flight
Cause I got church in the AM, preach!
Call me Uncle Drew they don't know who they playing with boy
There's levels to this weird, levels to this beard
Rappers I grew up on now on levels with my peers
I'm down at the piers, pan sear the Ahi
Coogi sweater it was knitted by the Aussies

[Hook]

[Verse 3: F.E.R.N]
From my cousin pop lock with the L this your song
Singing from the yard 'cuz it's so strong
Street life met me at like 16
Lil jit stunting on them bikes having big dreams
18 painting pictures like Sistines
99' had the double din big screen
For two years drove my Honda round the big tree
2005 signed to Sony rocking this scheme
And time flies seen 'em throw it at me
I'm a G did mine with the Lord beside me
The whole time I was there they hadn't tried me
Respect goes a long way, I noticed that actually
And now back to the streets
They still playing keeps, y'all still staying asleep
When the enemy's out there devouring the weak
And you worry 'bout your petty little salary this week
You see, they got you thinking bout the wrong thing
Promoting real heavy like Don King
And this is that flow y'all been waiting for
So listen to the words that the song sings
Fern

[Hook]

[Outro: Martymar]
Ay yo, um, catch me in Washington Heights
Not speaking English
Haha
Aaah![Intro]
Look, I don't care who you are
You can relate to this one
You know, some people in your life for short season of time
And it's almost better that you bury the memories of them
Because you already moved on and holdin' onto it just don't make no sense
Sometimes we go and dig it up
Like, just curious...

[Verse 1]
Is it corny if I admit
That I check up on you from time to time when I'm on the net
I promise I ain't no stalker it's so awkward
When I actually come across you I act like I ain't bothered a bit
And you know what that is and I know too
That's pride mixed with lies mixed with I want you's
Kind of maybe sort of or the order could be off
Often I wonder if I regret what I lost
At a later time cause my state of mind make me blind
I pray it isn't if it was I wouldn't admit it
I thought that I was heading in the right direction
But maybe loneliness has got me second guessing
I got some fly women they follow me on twitter
I think I'll DM 'em alright I'm trippin'
But I'm hardwired for intimacy
So why does my loneliness lead to compromise
Oh contentment, come quick!

[Hook]
I'm still curious
(Sometimes) I'm still curious
(I think about you) I'm stil curious

[Verse 2]
Is it weird it's been a few years
We celebrated the ball dropping together (cheers)
The stuff you used to wear, different products in your hair
When I smell'em in the air I feel like you're somewhere near
Is it me is it you was it lie was it truth
Maybe it's just nobody's ever good enough for you
Ok I swear I'm going through asked my homie what to do
He said boy listen here cause I'm finna tell the truth
Everybody think about they ex's
Even if you got kids, married to your best friend
In them memories are easily made but hard to forget
Cause they ex'ed up in your heart the good times and regrets
It's curiosity get you in trouble
Specially if it's forbidden kind that you run to
Ah man yeah you're more sensitive then you'll ever admit
So be careful who you make memories with
The secret is to learn what it means to be content
And celebrate what God's given not the things He didn't
Our heart is always longing for more and it wanna bug out
That's why we gotta drink from that water that never run out
But sometimes

[Hook]
I'm still curious
It takes a moment to make memories
A lifetime to forget them[Verse 1]
It was just last week that my grandma died
It's been years since I've seen family on my father's side
A bittersweet moment but tell me why
Nothing less than the sting of death brought us together
I said, listen to the priest tell lies
To appease loved ones in they seats
When you're looking at a face that's weeping
The grim truth don't bring 'em no peace
So I put on all white gloves like Mr. Jackson
Carry the casket to the Cadillac then
I realize this is the first time that me and my brothers ever did something together
Whatever, I'm grown now, come on, let's just put on our smiles and take pictures, we can take pictures
Eat this humble pie and leave them dishes
For somebody else to clean 'em until I see ya'll again

[Pre-Hook]
(Breaking down, breaking down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Br-br-Breaking down, breaking down)
It's all breaking down down down
(Breaking down, breaking down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Breaking down, breaking down)
But this won't be forever no

[Hook]
You used to make me cry
But one day he'll wipe every tear from our eyes
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died, but until that day

[Interlude]
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh (this won't be forever)
This won't be forever

[Verse 2]
I hopped off the plane
My God, what a scene that I seen on that TV screen
People huddled round, hands on they mouth
Not again, same problem, it hit a new town
Twenty-six dead, twenty of 'em kids
Where do you begin when some lives just ended
And everybody got the question
"If God's so good, how he let this happen?"
Is it mental health? Is it gun control?
Is it we make superstars out of animals?
Is it the movies we make? The video games?
I don't know, but God I want an antidote
All I know is this world is broken
Our sin is the reason it ain't like it's supposed to
Words fall short tryna comfort the grieving
But you gotta know that there's hope to believe in
One day my God gon' crack the sky
He gon' bottle up every tear that we ever cry
Bring truth to every lie, justice for every crime
All our shame will be gone and we'll never have to hide
No more broken hearts, no more broken homes
No more locking doors, no more cops patrolling
No abusive words, or abusive touches
No more cancerous cells that'll take our loved ones
No more hungry kids, no more natural disasters
No child will ever have to ask where his dad is
No funerals, where we wear all black
And death will be dead, then we'll lock the casket, yes

[Hook x2]

[Interlude/Outro][Produced by Alex Medina and Andy Mineo]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, pocket full of boarding passes
Huh, I don't know what city I was in last
But I'm out here tryna make a impact
Same time keep myself intact
Say, take it, take it easy A like it's gym class
Tell me how I could?
There's slaves in the world, before I die I'm trying to see us end that
So I move fast, Ramadan, uh
Move fast, Autobahn
Who cares if I ever get a Grammy nom
If my soul take L's, phenomenon
Still can't believe I get paid for this
As a kid, all I did was pray for this
Now I'm living out my dream, craziest
Got me really feeling like I was made for this
At the same time never knew how dangerous
It could be when lives start getting changed to this
When somebody say you they favorite
Guess it carry some weight to it
You know, cause ugh
That's power, and that's influence the temptation is
To use it for myself and serve somebody else
I'm sitting here bugging just remembering
What them rappers showed me, ugh
How to bag a honey, stack the money
They said I was a mac by the number of shorties that I could smash
Now I'm waiting on that matrimony
Cause, I've been changed up
Lil' homie came up
It's depressing, kicking it with dudes I used to look up to
They still on that same stuff, what!?

[Refrain]
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund

[Hook]
I feel like it's the real me, feel me?
Yeah I been changed, but I'm still me
What I am now, not what I will be
I'm tryna give life
But this could be the death of me, oh
The death of me
This could be the death of me, uh
(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The death of me
This could be the death of me, uh
(Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, mama feel like she losing me to this lifestyle that's consuming me
I travel every weekend even when I'm weak man
You know what that to do to me, huh?
Back pain, back pain
Sleeping on planes, I'm feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Blackout at night on that stage
Man I need a batcave just to get away, uh
Jesus retreated, woo!
To speak with his Father, I know that I need it
My career been growing
But tell me where I'm going if my time with God is depleted
God I'm sorry I mean it
All I want to do is walk with you, but
My priorities wrong, I talk about you more than I talk with you, uh
One of my mentors taught me whenever things get foggy
If you wanna grow in God it's not complicated it's just costly
Gotta spend that time, currency, uh
Overtime guess I learned to be, uh
Strong enough to admit I'm weak
To meet with God all I need is me
Yeah, 2014 'bout to be different
I think my favorite word'll be no
Opportunities come and they go
But none of them is worth my soul
That's something that you can't afford
And got me thinking what's most important
I get kicks, watchin' grown men in line for some Jordans
Nowadays, time is fortune
But chasin' fortune is all consumin'
I feel like God's calling dudes
They just wanna play Call of Duty
This that Peter Pan, at the dinner table out in Never Land
Eating, can't nobody see it but me and my boys
That's the way I wanna keep it, huh
I lost a couple friends to this new season
Jealousy and hate for a few reasons
Used to be down, now what's up?
Guess everybody around when the fun's up, yup
Got me feeling isolated
Women wanna holla, I just tell em' that I'm taken
Even if I wasn't I'd be slow for the taking
I'll know if they love me or the money I'm making
Ain't no way to really tell
Where somebody heart truly at
Bad girls coming at me looking good
Showing off they body that's a booby trap
Beard low, but I never let my guard down, huh
Buddy, I ain't crazy
You ain't bout' to catch me slipping
Pull a Million Dollar Baby!
Me and Dre trying to eat good
Cutting out the nonsense
On the road trying to give life, huh
But, I might lose mine in the process

[Refrain] + [Hook]
