[Verse 1]
Yeah, livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just cause
Type of shit I see and probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sitting on the rug
Basedheads coming through looking for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night its hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Living life to the fullest, I got to blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
God damn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Waking up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat (GunShots) like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap, finna put you on your back
Like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Got to leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh
Just stop, stop, stop
‘fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches and the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even got to drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related

[News Reporter]
"Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight."

[Verse 2]
Living life like this, hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it Imma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about
What I pray about, check it uh yeah
Got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I want to run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the- (Gunshots) -in the dead of night
Selling crack to my own pops
Pushing this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
[Pause]
Get down or lay down
Hit you with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Living how I'm living with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s riding with me, I’m riding with them
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em, and hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life
Anybody that's gang related[Produced by Showbiz]

[Refrain]
Woop-woop, that's the sound of da police
Woop-woop, that's the sound of da beast

[Verse One]
Stand clear, Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out, we run New York
Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack but you be doin' that
I'd rather say "see ya" cause I would never be ya
Be an officer, you wicked overseer
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

[Refrain]

[Verse Two]
Now here's a little truth, open up your eyes
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word "overseer," like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity, check the similarity
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrolling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Refrain]

[Verse Three]
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wann check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up till today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great, great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop

[Refrain][Produced by DJ Premier]

[Hook]
And now for my next number I'd like to return to the

[Nas]
Classic

[Kanye West]
Uh, uh, - timeless

[Kool G Rap]
Live straight classic

[Nas]
Classic

[Kool G Rap]
Live, straight classic

[Kanye West]
Timeless

[Sample]
I'd like to return to the classic

[Rakim]
Kanye West

[Rakim Sample]
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yea, is y'all ready for 20-07
It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, why are we bugging out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of classic is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call em uppies, when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You can't buy this Superfly-ness
Like a shine is, your highness
Is performing, look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

[Hook]

[Nas Samples - One Love & It Ain't Hard To Tell]
Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

[Hook: Samples]

[KRS-One Sample]
"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got Criminal Minded
You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why, I don't need em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at?, c'mon where you at
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

[Hook][Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs listless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher, partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9ne's vilde!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house through the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was, when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon and spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the  Heck and K
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul file sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckers[Intro]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
Cos I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks

[Verse 1]
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, "Ill"
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

[Verse 2]
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

[Verse 3]
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'emYou you can't can't be be ripping the mic the mic like do re me me
Measles are contagious like my lyrical pages
Ripping and flipping the mic
From back in the back in the days, these days it's kinda hectic, hectic
When these suckers don't respect it, check it
Flame on, I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
Cause they were taught that serious poetry would come from Socrates
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
If I was in front of Shakespeare, I'd battle the punk and take his shit
I'm not having it
Bust the narrative I come to give, listen
Rap is something you do, Hip Hop is something you live
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the video
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio
Got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
Cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco Disco, the disc is like a Nabisco
Chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie
I'm rocking beats and with death defying feats
And I'm never squeaking, I'm always freaking when I'm speaking
Inside I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek and
So this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go...
Round and round, round we go
Two years ago a friend of mine
And Flash is gonna rock your mind
Welcome to the terror dome, the terror dome
I wonder if I take you home
E-F-F-E-C-T
A cool operator operating correctly
But back in the days I knew rap would never die
Too late baby bye bye in a batty boy head, head, head
Insane in the membrane
Take the train, take the train
M-E-T-H-O-D man...
...Hattan keeps on making it, Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
Party people
I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super ho
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back, back
Back to the grill again, the grill again
Friends
How many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Kris
Hey! Ho! Keep on moving don't stop no...
...Body beats the Biz
Let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
Hey, Erick Sermon, hey
You you get off my cloud
Go down baby, go down baby
The gods must be crazy
You ain't fresh, you ain't fresh, yeah[Refrain]
Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there's no one left (Buku, buku! Alla de massive)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo)
No MC can test *cut and scratch of KRS saying "but one"*
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day for the, rapture

Yeah, what what
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Verse One]
I'm bout to hit you with that tradional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run of mill, cause for the mill I don't run

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Refrain]

[Verse Two]
Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Refrain][Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a RastaSpirits rise from the dead when I decapitate grills
I make bodies disappear like David Copperfield
Evil lurks in the dark and all you see is the whites of my eyes
Don't look at my eyes! Don't look at my eyes!
I kill and massacre and burn away all the body flesh
Cremating more bodies than David Koresh
Feel the fire and the flame and the way
I word this
Quotes from my Satanic Verses
Redrum rap voice
? rap voice
Gravedigger rap voiceWelcome to hip-hop culture
Where DJ-ing, MC-ing, graffiti art, breaking
And the philosophies are expressed everyday
Within the inner cities of America, and the world
You are not doing hip-hop;
You ARE hip-hop
Love yourself and your expression; you can't go wrongAnybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on
And put em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party

These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the negativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture![Intro: KRS-One]
Come! Come with me now! To a time, long forgotten

[Verse One: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
I grew up in the streets, like everyone else
But instead of pushin drugs I push knowledge in self
While them cats was in the back, smokin them moolies
I was buildin with the Gods, who used to wear kufi's
Africa pendents, with sevens on them
Real black man summit y'all never saw 'em
The cops caught 'em, real leaders, real street preachers
Black Panthers style Poor Righteous Teachers
This before the cell phones and the beepers
Conscious black men with fly new sneakers
Both styles came from us, guns bust
We were Criminal Minded but In God We Trust
Not that white man God the other one
We didn't call that God we called our brother one
And our sister was the Earth, peace God
No need to act it (Now let me bless y'all with some jewels)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, freedom
Justice, equality (Food) clothing
Shelter, love, peace, happiness
THESE ARE THE JEWELS TO LIFE


[Verse Two: KRS-One] (*DJ Premier Scratchin) (**Grand Puba)
(*Oh my God!) Where you think the cypher come from? (The Gods!)
Who you think them cops were runnin from? (The Gods!)
The streets were hard but the streets had Gods and Earths
(**Sun, Moon and Stars!!!) This is my universe
Rebirth, a new way of seein
Seein black people as celestrial beings
To raise our whole self esteem in
We started Third Eye seein and seein what Martin was dreamin
Gods on the boulevard buildin on life
Wise Intelligence, King Sun, Just Ice
King Aziatic nobody's equal
Rakim, these are enlightened people
The 5 percent, visit The School Of Mecca in Harlem
If you never went, It's good time spent
I'll bet ya come out with a new tactic
But while we here (Kris go 'head, just drop it)

[Hook: KRS-One] (Grand Puba)

[Verse Three: Grand Puba]
I deal with actual facts, I keep it right and exact
And If in doubt I do without so I could stay on my route
The original man the true ruler of the land
Related to the universe by the Pineal gland
Armed with epidermis so the sun won't burn us
It's natural while others fry they in the furnace
It's God Body don't let the 10 percent fool ya
Teachin lies and false religion so that they can rule ya
Why oh why got you lookin to the sky
Got you believin that you 'gon get some heaven when you die
Meanwhile, the 6th sense 'til you turn
Unit followed by 21 ciphers you should run
196 million, 900,040 thousand, and we still in public housin
Now It's our turn, listen
Like KRS-One say, homey, You Must Learn[Verse 1: KRS One]
We hit 'em and get 'em
We stick 'em and jig 'em
We pick 'em and kick 'em
Flippin' them whip and
I'm wing clippin' them lip cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and
My tribe be on a quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in 'em
Splittin' and strippin' 'em down while spittin' a round
Into them soundclash see winnin' them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' 'em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, others be stealin'them

[Verse 2: Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to fuck with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go
Let's see if you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This show is real, this is the deal, guns I'm running
Gotta make it out of town to flip my shit and keep it coming
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night
With a bunch of niggas and two mics
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my nigga Biggie

[Verse 4: Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the niggas and the bitches stay paid, fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a bitch
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the niggas from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get niggas from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo, this is for my niggas on the block all day
Who don't give a fuck waiting for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo, we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best niggas that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
Niggas coming through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Coming deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Verse 5: Cam'Ron]
We destroy niggas, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Making about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type
You need a dyke, babygirl, I see the light
But sometimes y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

[Verse 6: Bounty Killer]
?????????????????????

[Verse 7: Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leaving one-third damaged
With your back cracked the Earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the Earth of the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasing motherfuckers through malls, and clash in halls
Beating motherfuckers through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin down elevator shafts
Searchin for they ass, stayin low in the grass
Wearing a gas mask, wrapping their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin mad
What? Yeah yeah, sooooooooooooo

[Verse 8: Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with your hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her ass back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, nigga what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at

[Verse 9: Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, eEnglish, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you fuck you and that bitch on your bike
Brick City

[Verse 10: Reverand Run]
Ayo, now bust it
Never try me crimey, I'm grimy, so don't deny me
I be little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(Now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that nigga
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

[Outro: All]
The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hot[KRS-One]
YES! Chillin in the place right now
Harmony and Heather B, Ms. Melodie
DJ Jamal-Ski, DJ Kenny Parker
And of course we are gettin MUCH DARKER
Because the Africanism is in EFFECT
So check it out, MAN!
And try not to bite the lyrics
POI!

So come in now with the chorus of the day
Because we don't play

[Chorus: KRS-One]
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
It takes one soundsystem playin music loud
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
But D-Nice, you're gonna make the party live

[Verse One: D-Nice]
Bust it, yo
I love to diss whores, I love to do tours
Makin young ladies just drop their drawers
And when they drop em, I don't kick em, check it
Like the Fat Boys said, I "Brrrrrrrr, STICK EM!"
From that point on, I say we're on for the night
But I love it when the girl just call me D-Nice
And if she gets bold and try to ask for a fee
I say, "Please ho, it's all about me"

[Verse Two: Heather B]
It's not the star spangled banner or the red white and blue
But the underground sister from the Edutainment Crew
So what you do, is back up if you work for Bush
Cause all the Presidential prison pushin politicians
Gotta get MUSHED, gimme back my land you SUCKA
You beat down my father and you raped my mother Africa
And now you wanna laugh at her
I feel like pickin up a razor, and slashin ya
Snatch up Margaret Thatcher and unmaskin her
To find out she's a man without a manicure
Go to President DeKlerk without askin her
And BUST SOME SHOTS for South Africa
And if Margaret jumps in, I start bashin her
For every freedom fighter start crashin her
And then Heather B will get nastier
And pull out my two shot derringer
Cause yes, Heather B comes classier
Cause Heather B, Jamal-Ski, and KRS the trainer
Makes up the dope crew called, Edutainer
You'll find the law of balance on the two turntables
So look out for the FRESH Edutainer label

[Break: KRS-One]
Biddi-by-by, by, by-by-by, Jamal-Ski, ki-ki-kiyah!

Jump up and be upon the mic and stick em

That moves with the rhythm passionately

And three (badda-ba-ba-by-by) it's the magic numberrr

[Chorus: KRS-One]
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
It takes one soundsystem playin music loud
It takes 7 Dee Jays to control a sound
But KRS, you're gonna make the party live

[Verse Five: KRS-One]
Well now it's Blastmaster KRS-One
When we come in the dance, my lyrics not done
Pray to my father cause yes me are the son
Cause you are the guide and my pro-tection
Any sucker MC must run come

Move ya ras claat, BDP stand alone

Every posse KNOW we come in the dance

Reality, reality-ta-ta-tee

Come up in the dance, and him must comb him hair-ah
Come up in the dance, and me let off a clip-ah

Well I'm up in your face like the wind from a blizzard
Got my wrap around your throat, like you're chokin on a gizzard
If someone said, well damn, who is it?
It's Ms. Melodie, the real, so get with it

[Verse Seven: Jamal-Ski]
Fatalistic pessimistic, a big conspiracy
The way they treat blacks, in white society
It's erection rebellion, revolution uprisin
Takin no shorts, because JAH is guidin
Government they try to manage and rule
Dictate, regulate, and perpetrate the fool
That's why I search, explore, inspect, investigate
Drop down knowledge, and KILL dub plates

[Verse Eight: KRS-One]
Kill dub plate-ah mi say kill dub plate-ah
Kill dub plate-ah mi say kill dub plate-ah
KRS-One, boy, must come fi straighter

Close the book, pick up your gun
And fight in the African revolution
Righteous man, get liberation
Wicked man get execution
It's called the battle of armageddeon
Through my mouth is a translation
Unto recknoning to circulation
Nuff African education
DJ Kenny Parker YES you are the don
Edutainer teach nuff wisdom

1..Well my ladies and gentlemen
This is a rapsession and my name is "KRS-One!"
And when I talk about "Hip-Hop Music!", I know

[Kris]
One : Breaking or breakdancing
Rally b-boying, freestyle or streetdancin'
Two : MC'ing or rap
Divine speech what I'm doing right now no act
Three: Grafitti art or burning bombin'
Taggin', writin', now you're learning! uh!
Four : DJ'ing, we ain't playing!
{*scratch*} You know what I'm saying!
Five : Beatboxing
Give me a {*beatboxin*} Yes and we rockin'!
Six : Street fashion, lookin' fly
Catchin' the eye while them cats walk on by
Seven: Street language, our verbal communication
Our codes throughout the nation
Eight: Street knowledge, common sense
The wisdom of the elders from way back whence
Nine : Street entrepreneur realism
No job, just get up call 'em and get 'em

Here's how I'm tellin' it, all 9 Elements
We stand in love, no we're never failing it
Intelligent? No doubt
Hip-Hop? We're not selling it out, we're just lettin' it out
If you're checkin' us out this hour, we teatchin' hip-hop
Holy integrated people have it, I'm the present power!

[Hook]
Rap is something you do!
3x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
Rap is something you do!
Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*

[Kris]
Skaters, BMX-bike riders rock
Don't you ever stop! You are hip-hop
You doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs
You know you be packing that black block
Selling that crackrock and ecstasy
Gettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me
But like I told those in the ghettoes
Here's the facts! True hip-hop is so much more than that
Some much more than rap, so much more than beats
Hip-hop is all about victory over the streets
What you see on TV is a lie
That's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by
But, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?
You don't want the entertainment, you wanna be dead on the pavement
Well, so be it, some of ya'll ain't gonna see it
Others wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!

[Hook]
Rap is something you do!
5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*

"Oh yea" *scratched* --- From "P is dead"

"I have spent my whole life livin'", "talk to the fullest", "no doubt"

[Kris]
You know that's why these rappers can't hang
Cause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thing
They so careless, hip-hop is in awareness we give
Rap we do, hip-hop we live
How many times I gotta say it? How the radio ain't gonna play it
And you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it
Think about it! (think about it)
The present course of action, we have got to reroute it!

[Hook: repeat 3X]
Hip-Hop is something you live!"As we procede, to give you what you need..."

[KRS-One]
Turn up your radios right now, classic!
Hip-Hop culture in full and total effect
MCing, DJing, breaking, graf
Management, philopsophy, you not stoppin me
KRS-One, comin down from heaven
From Hot 97, Lisa Evans
You know what time it is, it's time to sever
KRS-One will never, fail, time to exhibit
Yo whattup kid, we get with it
We come down, you can't forget it (uhh)
My man - Common Sense, yo you intense
You gonna come down in just a little bit
But KRS-One will have to get with, the lyrical skills that we flip
Bronx in the house, OHHHH (uhh) I'm givin what I got to give
It's my prerogative to kick the positive
I'm givin what I got to give - now listen up~!
As I, proceed, to cut
My... voice like this it goes, Scott Scott, Scott LaRock
Scott, Scott-Scott, Scott LaRock, Scott Scott LaRock
And Trouble T-Roy, Biggie, Mastadon, Cowboy (UHH)
Scott Scott, Scott LaRock, Scott-Scott, Scott, Scott LaRock
It goes Scott LaRock, and Trouble T-Roy
Biggie, Mastadon, Cowboy
Whiz Kid, Punk and Buffy, Eazy-E
Sugar Shaft, Prince Messiah, Mercury
Pinkhouse, 2Pac, Tu-Tu, 2Pac
Tu..Tu-2Pac, Tu-Tu, 2Pac, Scott LaRock
And Trouble T-Roy, Biggie, Bi-Bi-Biggie, Biggie, Biggie
Mastadon, Cowboy, Whiz Kid, Punk and Buffy, Eazy-E
Sugar Shaft, Prince Messiah, Donald D
KRS-One in the house, you know how we be
Comin through straight from the mighty BDP
Yo Common Sense (what) you wanna get on? (YEAH~!)
And represent kickin a freestyle song

[Common]
A freestyle song
The microphone I palm, like it was a Sunday
But today is a Monday, Sunday my day of rest
Yo "I'm Still #1" but I gotta say peace to KRS (HAA!!)
I can say I'm fresh when I come in
Style start to runnin, a hundred styles and runnin
Rappers I start to gunnin
This is what I do when me and KRS get together
I ask Lisa, I will be here FOR-EVER (EVER, AHH!!)
Puttin stuff together
This is how I weather with the brainstorm
Let my name form a lot of things, yo the man of the hour
Peace to, Power 106, they put me in the mix
Like Hammer but I jam a, little bit (hah, what!)
Yo this is what I'm doin when I'm feelin
Like I'm Latrell Sprewell when I start to stealin on cultures
Pullin posters, they just roaches, thinkin they the joint
I'm on point like Rod Strickland, I be the big man
Comin to New York with a new talk from Chicago
Follow, I roll like a model, hold the bottle
Com Sense I never swallow my spit, I just spit on rappers
On they grave, they better save that bull
This is my zone, whack MC's they better call Tyrone
I got me and KRS, you know the time
I show the rhyme, check it out
We show divine, how it goes down

[KRS-One]
Straight to your mental it's the style of the Temple
Worldwide representin the microphone and the pencil
Like Brooklyn Brooklyn be always funky fresh
Dope hooks and dope rhymes, that's always KRS
Their words can't hit me, their dogs can't sic me
Their knives can't stick me... {*fades out*}The beat was sposed to drop right there
The beat was sposed to drop right there
The beat was sposed to drop right there
Yeah yeah yeah... uhh

I send this one out, to my right hand man
Or mens, or womens, the whole crew
The real fam

Chorus: KRS-One

We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin videos
Or actin really silly yo but really doe
All that can end...
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

Verse One: KRS-One

If we can't have trust then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond we connect on the same deck
Same intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly
If you can't understand, we boys we boys
We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin toys
It ain't about your Benz I hope it ain't about mine
My man, I be dissin in my freestyle rhyme
Gettin G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl
My man, we chillin at the jam, what's the plan?
I'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men
Or women, I'm drivin, I see my peeps yo get in
Where you fit in? True friends are quick to sit
In the beginning of all trouble, and when your bankroll doubles
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble
Still I got my own space like Hubble

Chorus

Verse Two: KRS-One

Cause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Until we blow the spot then they all wanna crowd us
And wanna shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin large I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get
What they can get, sit quickly backstabbin the click
I roll thick, but only some are friends really
Down to the end, my right hand men and women
Mutual support, from the beginning
Been in, exactly what I've been in

Chorus

Verse Three: KRS-One

Back to back we attack corporate America
Gettin fees that amount to G's in every area
You my man I ain't gotta drag you along
You pull your own weight, yeah you definitely got it goin on
I don't see nothin wrong wit a little bumpin car system
Thumpin, between the crew we always got sump'un
But if we had nuttin no frontin whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together
Word, fake people ain't worth a turd
They only want to be your friend because of what they overheard
I send this record to the well respected
Friends that I've collected, I hope I am what you expected
Yeah, so check it, so check it

Chorus[Refrain]
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what, ah yeah

[Verse One]
So here I go kickin' science in ninety-five
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin' through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have one style: gun buck
But when you say, "Let's buck for revolution"
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO
That's for calling my sister a ho, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
You black people still thinkin' about vot-ing
Every President we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died

[Refrain]

[Verse Two]
This is not the first time I came to the planet
But everytime I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my Commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin' the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin' to like
Get with you, showin' you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
And enters into Kwame Ture

[Refrain]

[Verse Three]
In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
The devil cannot see through as I unload
Into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
And leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
Makin you a naked body, addict and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic

[Refrain][KRS-One]
Uhh! They don't wanna battle
They ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh (Temple of Hip-Hop)
Listen, listen, listen

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Your spirit AIN'T READY
Your church AIN'T READY
Your bishop AIN'T READY
Your deacons AIN'T READY
Your choir AIN'T READY
Your ushers AIN'T READY
At the Temple of Hip-Hop
WE TEACH MANY!

[KRS-One]
Look! To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
If these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
.. listen, listen, listen

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Look! Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christ-ians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin it's
Urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition, from the start
But we now know, the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say somethin to the streets kid!
All these churches surroundin the devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From "Criminal" to "Spiritual Minded", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin - what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin in sin
Hear the truth - how long you think you gonna last
Rockin the mic, without havin to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher outrap them
Yes there's life after platinum[Intro: KRS-One]
You know it's Kris!

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they running this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and popping them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we popping they brains out
It's supposed to be about seeking in the seek out
You witnessing injustice, you got to speak out
If you claiming you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you running over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A hip-hop guild we got to begin building 'em
It's supposed to be no police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of our lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about making it better
You see, hip-hop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead, be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doing your part, that's how it's supposed to be
Pursuing your art, that's how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, that's how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you moving slowly
Then talking junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
I Touch "50 MC's" like Tony
Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
I spit the truth, but I'm not the only
There's plenty, K-R-S-O-N-E

[Chorus][Intro: KRS-One]
Ay, ay Buckshot, look at them run
Ha, look at them run up the bloodclaat block

[KRS-One]
Class in session, y'all late an' shit
Buckshot, KRS is some amazin' shit
We spit amazin shit, you'll be amazed and shit
Like you in a maze and shit
Standin there like this some amazin' shit
I'm old school, I'm not amazed by SHIT!
I smash rappers crazy quick, with crazy hits
Then head to the clinic cause they make me SICK!
This some amazin' shit
Just the grit and the grime of the streets we was raised in it
And it gave us an amazin' gift, an amazin' lift
Like when you blaze an amazin' spliff
Huh, or drink a fifth with me
On some amazin' shit like an epiphany
I spit amazin' shit, get hip to me
Then hop to me, learn my philosophy
Ha! Yeah! Light up!

[Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin'... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin'... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin'

[Buckshot]
It's amazin', Buck's the dot-com don
When other niggas was like, fuck the dot-com
Shit's amazin', how soon we just came up
Like an elevator, and he hella greater, and what?
Stand up, and I don't mean the comic relief
Cause shots'll hit your funny bone every time it released
My mind is a beast, amazin' what you find in them streets
Let's see - Buckshot, my peeps, my grind and my heat
B.C., amazin', like Luther Vandross, I amaze the purse
You should see what the man costs a verse
You don't amaze me, I'm the boss
You ignorant niggas is caught up in the maze of course
Nigga get lost

[Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin shit', la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
Amazin shit', la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah

[KRS-One]
Amazin' shit, Kris still blazin' shit
Yo these rappers ain't sayin' SHIT
They say, say, but I'm Beyoncé
Man, I'm upgradin' shit
Y'all needle rappers, barely makin' it
You better change your ways before it's too late an' shit
You see how I spit that amazin' shit?
It's my God that gets appraised for it
RUCK!

[Sean Price]
It's amazin', so amazin'
Keep talkin' that shit I'll push your face in
It's amazin', so amazin'
How I handle all that shit I been facin'
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (yo, yo)
Amazin shit, Ruck's an amazin ape
I eat your food but, first say amazin' grace
Pray, I don't come through and blaze the place
But the terrible tec-9'll do your amazin' eight
Amazin', the way the god spit these bodies
Y'all niggas screamin' like you hit somebody
Amazin', nigga, listen
I crack your face with the fifth now
Grab him the eyepatch like you related to Rick
Amazin', the way the god rap to the beat
Beat earth, wind and fire when I'm packin' the heat
Amazin', how I went from nothin' to somethin'
Took somethin', make somethin' and threw it all away on nothin'
Amazin', the way the god was rapin' the ville
A couple of years ago from sellin' pagers and pills
Amazin', how the god once slung crack
And survived more shootouts than Chow Yun Fat
Amazin', motherfucker

[Outro: Loudmouf Choir]
Amazin'... la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lah-lah-lah-lah
[KRS-One]
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang-ay
Listen to my 9-millimeter go BANG![Intro]
Run, run, run, run...
Will you stay or will you run
When you looking at this

[Chorus]
I know you young but are you looking at this
I know you got dumb but are you looking at this
Your day is gonna come when you looking at this
Will you stay or will you run when you looking at this

[Verse 1]
You cannot see we now free, we get cassette back
So everytime I get the microphone I gotta bless that
Everytime I speak the truth they hopin' you forget that
9/11 truth got proof, you know we rep that
The war was started on a lie - did you forget that?
Politics is all about money and we accept that
Voting is like joking with rights we'll never get back
This a different type of rap of what you might've guessed eh?
Fresh rap - put it on your tongue, man, test that
People always askin' and passin' where KRS at
I be teachin', preachin' and speakin' a little less rap
Educators, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2]
Too many rappers talkin' 'bout now they the best at
While KRS-One is at levels they'll never get at
Beat bitin', fakin' the funk - dudes respect that?
All these lies hitting your head, right where you rest at
They take your mind off the truth and put it where the sex at
Now these rappers doing R&B - forget that
In the game I'm bright, I'm skipped twice, they left that
Cash - I don't stress that, the stage is where I'm fresh at
Cats want cars but don't know where East or West at
Steering themselves right into where the stress at
Their own words got 'em sick and right there where the mess at
Talking like demons but wanting God to bless that
Take a minute, step that
Think a minute, digest that
It's not every day a teacher speaks and you get that
Down goes the devil - ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
The American presidency is for sale and you can check that
You think one man, one vote really elects that
News with views? Where's the free press at
Don't let 'em take your mind and put it where the rest at
Edutainers, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus][KRS-One]
Who was the first to flash the heat on the cover?
Who was the first crew to go against another?
Who was the first to go acapella on a video replay?
Who was the first to lose a DJ?
Who was the first to teach at Yale?
Who was the first to hit that hip-hop reggae, on the nail?
Who was the first to say Stop the Violence
And teach that real bad boys move in silence?
You're soon to see the mindbendin rhyme weapon
Get more busy than two-two-three-double-nine-seven
All these rappers, swear they the best
I know whatchu thinkin about, "Where's KRS?"
Eighty percent of these rappers fake they {shit}
The other twenty percent they goin upstate and {shit}
There's no way out except knowledge and wisdom
I got it so I spit 'em you ain't got it you gotta get 'em
Who was the first to produce mix and write
At the same time up in the club rockin the mic?
Who was the first to have a DJ and a side man?
The first to say what is hip-hop? "I AM!"
Who was the first to produce gangster {shit}?
Put out, gangster hits with a gangster click?
Not no prankster {shit}, Steady B, Mad Lion
Just-Ice, Shabba Ranks and {shit}
My Channel is Live, my only battle is Jive
MC to MC, you won't survive
You'll be censored cause my Crew is 2 Live
I ascend like Christ and watch you die

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Breakers (HERE!) MC's (HERE!)
Writers (HERE!) Beat-boxers (HERE!)

[KRS-One]
I'm like Noah, I'm takin 'em, two by two
I took, them and them and I'll take, you and you
I took, them and them and I'll take, you and you
Be I'm right or be I'm wrong
You'll see I'm tight with this mic, you should be like, "B I'm gone"
But you still in my face Neo, I'm not your girl
All that ice and thug life, that's not my world
I'm the teacher, but you still can't see
Cause while you respect 2Pac, 2Pac respected me
Another thing; don't ever show me another ring
Remember you Rudy Ray Moore, I'm Martin Luther King
Everything you bring sounds horrendous
You need repentance, 'fore I take attendance

[Hook]

{*KRS-One hums a melody for a bit*}

[Hook][Verse 1]
If you don't like what you singing, you sing a different hook
If you don't like what you cooking, you get a different cook
If you don't like what you wearing, you get a different look
You wanna escape Armageddon, read a different book
When knowledge is right there, we don't even look
December 2012 got this whole world shook
But look, the last days for others are the first days for us
The question to ask is who can you trust
Respect to all that 2012 stuff
But when you really study it it's fear, it don't apply to us
Yo, Hollywood lies to us, all day
The question is what does your culture say
Where's your culture at?
Who's your prophet?
What history guides your spiritual logic?
It starts with a story, then it's hypnotic
Then any myth that comes along, you just adopted it
Why? Because your culture, you forgot it
December 2012, let's continue this topic
Turn the page, the present world age
Began 3114 BC
According to the Mayan calendar, this age concludes December 21st 2012 AD
This 5125 years cycle of calm is one world age
Nothing changes overnight, it's all a process
A transition, it happens over many days
In the Mayan calculation a K'in, is one day
The Mayan Winal, that's 20 days
The Tun is 360 days
A K'atun is 7200 days
The B'ak'tun is 144,000 days
And they applied that to the Milky Way
In the cycles they saw the sun
Moving across the Milky Way's equator
Lining up with other galactic neighbors
We've been shifting for 30 years it seems
From 1980 to about 2016
The shift is now, it's occurring now
But if you're learning from the movies you won't know how to survive
Or stay alive after the storm
Cause after that a new world order is born
Oh, you don't know, man? About they programs?
You still watching Lindsay, you don't see that low hand?
Let go, man, the flood is coming
Don't be scared, get prepared, keep your motor running
Rock with me

[Hook]
Higher level

[Verse 2]
Yep, it's all mass control, here's the philosophy
Cortés knew about the Aztec prophecy
Before he invaded their society
He studied their cultural psychology
He knew they had armor, guns, and steeds
So he arrived in the Aztec year 1-Reed
That's the year Quetzalcoatl
Was prophecized to return from exile in fact
Cortés played out the Aztec myth
And took away those people's will to resist
Cortés played on religious beliefs
And blinded the Aztecs, cause he was a thief
Look, the Yucatan, that's a Mayan book of cycles
It lets the Mayans know when the Gods are gonna strike you
In fact, every 13 K'atuns you see
The Mayans were visited with a catastrophe
So every 200 and 56 or 7 years
The Mayan people lived with this fear
So on the island of Tayasal now Flores
The Spanish came armed with this knowledge
They knew according to the Mayan heavens
That the next cycle was 1697
So as the Mayans stood there fixed on the heavens
The Spanish showed up with all of their weapons
March 13th, 1697
The Mayan people learned a terrible lesson
Your fears and tears are used against you
Cause 80% of world control is mental
But back to the Mayans, they getting some more
257 years after Tayasal
A US-backed coup overthrows their democracy in 1954
That's exactly 257 years from when the Spaniards arrived at their shores
I'm getting to the core of the lesson
Lets see what happens in 2211
That's the next cycle, that people remember
Like 2012, the 21st of December
The consciousness may shift, you may turn the light
But you are the universe, you're gonna be alright
The pole may shift, your soul may lift
To higher consciousness but you know all this
The Edutainment style will persist
Forget the fear, it's knowledge that runs all this

Boogie Down, Crazy Town

(Chorus)
[Shifty Shelshock]
I'm a bad ass B-Boy two triple o
A space age hip-hop superhero

[Shifty Shelshock]
I rock the block with Glocks and brass knuckles
A pocket full of weed and a B-Boy belt buckle
Space age rage to rattle your cage
Running amok as we fuck up the stage
Taking hip-hop to a whole new level
8-0-8 brass over twisted metal
Shifty, the rebel supernatural a mac with a pull
Act a fool, excalibur, destroying MC's with my vocal algebra
We got something new for you, for you to take your ass and move it to
Hit to lose it to, it's that crazy crew
Taking you on a ride to the other side, check it
Bar codes on freaks, programmed to freak mode
Black holes of lost souls, let the story be told
I rock a B-Boy stance, cuz it's time to explode

(Chorus X 2)

[KRS-One]
If you ever want to know what time it is, compared to what time it isn't
When you hear KRS in the house, just run and get our ticket
Because when you come into the jam, the party will be kickin
All the wic wacs and DJ's in the house, jealous, it gets so sickenin'
Now CXT are some cool guys, still getting paid without no ties
At least no jack and I can't hack it
When you gonna ask the question why
I never liked working at Mickey D's, All my life I got B's and C's
Down with the crew called BDP
Shifty, and E.P.I.C., now when you be?

(Chours)

[KRS-One, Shifty Shelshock, Epic Mazur]
Put your mind over matter, gather round the sound
Yeah, gather round the sound
It don't get better, gather round the sound
Come on, gather round the sound

Put your mind over matter, gather round the sound
Yeah, gather round the sound
It don't get better, gather round the sound
Come on, gather round the sound

(Chorus)

[Epic Mazur]
I roll at light speed through space and time
With a boom box of beats and a book of rhymes
Cosmo kinetic I just don't get it
These fools want to rock but their rhymes are pathetic
The Epic, digital bliss, the mega sound
Consists of hard drive bits written underground
Crazy Town rocks so hard, you'll go berserk with the sound that travels around the universe
Ill thoughts disperse we're the first and last, high class, white trash, rolling a class hovercraft
In strange days, the wickedest ways become the norm
But it's far from the norm when we perform(Check it)
B-boys make some noise(Get connected)
Respect it, you should expect(the unexpected)
B-girls reping at front of the show
I'm a bad ass b-boy two triple O

(Chorus)x2

[KRS-One]
Dope thoughts come when I hear a kick drum
A bass beat transforms the level of the street
And the lyrics Boulevard status
Yo, I'm the baddest, beach front punks, they insist I'm the raddest
Thing to ever hit since L.S.D
Hallucinate while I dominate
I bring Satan to the table, when I rock there is not a label for it
Critics adore it homicidal as it gets, your wrist slit
When I make suicidal imprints on your brain
I induce pain, so I'm insane
Hell bent burnt you like acid rain
Extraordinary, I lyricize, specialize
In body rocking, rapping, and macking
Two triple O, I come to get down
With my clique Crazy Town
We came to get down
Yes, yes y'all we came to get down

(Chorus)

[KRS-One, Shifty Shelshock, Epic Mazur]
Put your mind over matter, gather round the sound
Yeah, gather round the sound
It don't get better, gather round the sound

Put your mind over matter, gather round the sound

Whew! Inebriated Beats. You got to Believe

[ Hook: repeat 6x ]

Believe it

[ Krs-One ]

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Look, Look
All my rap is street related
How can you spit and not have it hit the pavement?
These beats we created be inebriated
Meaning intoxicating, believe we made it
Now we can see they faded
Them hoes done went from me so horny to me so hated
From Hip Hop, we never deviated
Come to the Temple, hear the flow and you can see me state it
That Knowledge Reign Supreme
I be on the same streets, with them same hustlers and fiends
But Hip Hop, do you know what it means?
It means victory over the streets, check the last Beat Street scene
I leak knowledge, inner-standing, wisdom
KRS the type that get you outta the prison
Elite knowledge, inner-standing, wisdom
KRS the type that get you outta the prison, Believe

[ Hook ]

[ Krs-One ]

Yo, Yo, Believe it
I only come to help you achieve it
You could believe what you want, you can take it or leave it
Slow it up or speed it, but never mind if you dont need it
But I still gotta teach it, I still gotta speak it
There's more to the streets than guns and stuff
To all my fathers, you know one sons enough
But if you have two or three
You know they get -gasm what they see on the t.v
You gotta believe me
We gotta rise up
All my daughters I beg, close your legs and kind of like open your minds up
Before your times up, and you find what?
You was just another stepping stone for him to climb up
I'm what? A player? No
A ho? No. An average rhyme-sayer? No
A neighbor? Yes. A friend of the Savior? Yes
I can honestly say I'm blessed

[ Hook ]

[ Krs-One ]

Yo, its a Hip Hop intellectual heavyweight
That leaves 'em in a truly inebriated state
If you thinking about leaving, you better wait
We only talking about freedom and showing love instead of hate
But no, you dont think it's real
Until you're shackled 'round your wrists and your ankles and your heels
You could brag if you feel
But don't forget to mention the twenty to life is part of the deal
When the DEA flash that shield
The bigger they are as stars
Huh... the harder they squeal
And usually your name comes out
Leading to that knock on the door, and you being led out
That's when my lyrics matter
All them guns and bitches and hoes, you don't wanna hear them rappers
That's when you wanna hear pastors
But if you listen now, you can like avoid them disasters
Turn your life over to God today
Not a little bit, Yo, go all the way
I said, turn your life over to God today
Not a little bit, Yo, go all the way Yo

Payola on these stations, plus they run like plantations
Complete with black beats sportin soul by caucausians
If you hear me on your station best believe I'm not payin~!
KRS is the realest, KRS-One is fearless
I grew up in them days when crack was new to drug dealers
See them cats they be liars, we the New York survivors
Eighty-one to ninety-one, they was our record buyers
Now they front cause they got work tryin to redo all my work
'til we live and in concert, and I'm makin they eye hurt
Shinin so bright and so lively
Everybody know, hip-hop was better in the nineties

[Pee-Doe]
It was better in the nineties, the solo was grimey
The Wu-Tang Clan came in with the killer army
Grand Puba came in with Girbauds hangin low
Hilfiger Tommy niggas rockin Polo
40 ounce guzzlin, nickel bag coppin
Troopin through the block with the boom box knockin
All we do is "Spark Mad Ism" non-stop and
When Hot 97 played the real hip-hop and
I remember 98, point 7 KISS FM
With Kool DJ Red Alert, mixin up the blends
Them mixtape deejays had the streets on lock
Like Demo and Ron G, my nigga Doo Wop
Before the radio station corrupted the nation
To rule the street, A&R's discoverin the sensations
KRS came with the peace declaration
Took it with the leaders to the United Nations
