[Verse 1: Father]
Said she didn't wanna keep it
Look at God!
Guess that will be our little secret...
Hold that down (hold that back) (x4)
Pack after pack all summer
Gas guzzler I remind her of her Hummer
She remind me of Corolla
Hot boxing in the middle of August windows rolled up

[Hook: Father]
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
I want my wrists so cold pneumonia in my fist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Never had to whip a brick but I get the gist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
I want my wrists so cold pneumonia in my fist

[Verse 2: iLoveMakonnen]
My wrists done turned so cold
My arm got runny nose
I flip it for the high and get it for the low
I'm booked for all these shows
I cook for all these hoes
We turned a neighborhood kitchen into a 5 star stove
Super chef Makonnen might sprinkle serotonin
Be careful when you rolling because my wrist so goddamn potent
Oh bitch is you snoring?
Will wake up in the morning
Because wrist game stupid
And the wrist be going like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Key!]
Ok, I hurt my fucking wrist tryna jizz on your bitch

Hey wrist, wrist, wrist man I hurt my fucking wrist
Pulling risk, man you wouldn't understand about this shit
If I catch a opp

I ain't from the Chi, this Atlantastan
Boy that's it

[Verse 1: Drake]
Squad goin' up, nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some tings, one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn 'bout what she think

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]
And it ain't no way no, how I made it on my own
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta' go, you're moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

[Hook] x4[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Hook] (x2)
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean

[Verse 1]
OG pimping, trench coat mobbing
Money keep flowing from the bity to Bompton
West coast Makonnen, the best thing going
They really like my movies, it's the best thing showing
Boss Hogg playing, competition slaying
Sell the whole pack then relax before the day end
Making hella, mula', give a damn about your jeweler
Shouts out west Baltimore and free young moolah

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Haters can't see us, Nish or Taniya
We be in L.A. posting like the coliseum
Big smoking, PCH coasting
Sherantino Hotel, pent house toasting
When Straw-ber-ita dreams turn to champagne reality
Old friend been down since New Life Academy
Now we bound to the dough, it all make sense
Own our own homes we ain't gotta pay rent

[Hook] (x4)[Hook: ILoveMakonnen](x2)
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
I like to make money, get turnt
Got the white girl twerkin' like the work

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I pull up on the scene
Got a pocket full of white and the green
Bitches out of town know what I mean
They're like a song, goddamn we wanna sing
I smoke the best weed in the states
I don't fuck 'round with no fakes
I have to scrape the whole damn plate
I like to go to Steak 'n Shake

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
I like to [?] in the booth
Had to mix the white with the Goose
Pineapple with a little bit of juice
Your girl over there, you know she gon' choose
We the winners, natural born sinners
Come off in this bitch like, "Yeah what's for dinner?"
Eat these chumps up, and spit 'em back out
I'm the hottest mothafucka in the north and the south now

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]
I make money and get turnt
Spend it all at the bank
Put it all on dank
We don't play no games
I like to make money, get turnt
I got the white girl twerkin' like the work
I got my work twerkin' like the lil' white girl
I used to make it all off the white girl, but now I just...

[Hook] x3[Verse 1]
Now we ain't tryna have no fuckin' party
Unless your girls tryna all get naughty
I got some lean in my truck right now
And I'm tryna make it all go down
My friends like sniffin' cocaine
They hit the strip club on a bitch and make it rain
I like making money on the fuckin' corner too
But I'd much rather be somewhere doing wall street deals

[Hook]
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve
Whats the word on them? What's the word?
So can I swerve on em'? Can I swerve?
I had to swerve on em', I had to swerve

[Verse 2]
Now I'm always flying down on the highways
I be tryna make a money turn to five ways
I remember when I used to have a two way
And now I make the club go up on a Tuesday
My cousin outta town with that new shit
He comin' right back like a new pit
He barkin' with that new fuckin' sparker
Niggas out here crazy like they Waka

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I don't like to share my drugs
Cause all these niggas wanna smoke my bud
Don't nobody have no fuckin' money
They laugh at jokes, ha ha, they think this shit is funny
But ain't nothin' funny at all
I had to make a hundred thousand before fall
I got niggas tryna kick me out my house
I got niggas in the trap like a mouse

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now I'm bout to fly outta town
I'll be back in September when it's brown
On the leaves but I'll still have that green
I mean my friends kinda know what I mean
We be gettin' fuckin' drunk all the time now
I be tryna be in the high times now
On the front cover with my fuckin' dojer
I play games bitch I'm PlayStation controller
So let me swerve on em', so let me swerve

[Hook][Intro: ILoveMakonnen]
I'mma teach you how to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it
How to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it
How to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I do a cooking class on every Thursday
Parking lot at 6' o'clock jumpin' like a church place
I do a driving class on every Sunday
Turn a little Ferrari into a pretty Hyundai
They don’t know this new shit we on
We don’t really give a fuck when we in that zone
We blowing strong and gas at least, by the zone
I got bitches all night calling on my phone
Drinking lean all the day and plus I smoke with the wax
A little young nigga like me speak nothing but facts
I got them bitches out of town pulling up in a Cadillac
Smoking so much weed cause my grandma got them cataracts

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
But my friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Migos and Makonnen keep the blue Benjamins only
Trapping OG gas out the hotbox, and it’s stolen
I can teach you how to whip a whole thing
Hundred percent, that is cocaine
Young nigga kicking it like Liu Kang
Money coming back to me like boomerang
Teach me how to whip it, I got birds singing like Whitney
I can show a nigga how to make a million
I can show a nigga how to stash in the ceiling
I got the club going up, that was on a Tuesday
One phone call to the plug, he on the freeway
I can teach a nigga how to touch down on a plug just for a half a milli
I can teach a nigga how to pour a four of the muddy trouble cause I’m purple sipping
I can teach a nigga how to grab a chopper with extensions, spray the block with no intentions
I can show you just how to be real with you
If you’re pussy then nigga can’t deal with you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Teaching your bitch how to whip it
Kitchen, I cook up the Bentley
Bando, I made me a milli
Bitch, I had birds in the ceiling
These niggas snakes, that’s what Quavo told me
Got blue Benjamins, went and bought a Rolex
Whip a brick with the baking soda
Rich nigga trap off a Motorola
Come to the block, we got quality
Breaking my wrist, tryna whip a key
I was 12 with a felony
Sipping lean, that promethazine
I fell in love with the codeine
Young rich nigga, plenty chains on me
This how you whip up the coca
Remix the brick, then you flip it over

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Offset]
Teach me how to whip
In the kitchen cooking, no Jiffy
Made a quarter milli off of selling biscuits
Fucking with the brick, you need a tissue
Sold ten birds on Tuesday
Loubotin kicking, your bitch brought me kisses
I get more head than a toupee
I can be your tutor, baking soda, watch how I do it
In the lab, cooking the slab, stretch it ho, make it long as a ruler
I got niggas and they got on your medulla
Bottle like a cobra, hit em with the cooler
Rapped for three years and we made a lot of improvement
Don’t be a hater, nigga get with the movement
Used to be a nuisance riding with the ruler
On the Molly, booted, and I ran in to go use it
Nigga got a juug then I’m not gonna refuse it
Tryna rob a nigga without a strap, nigga you are foolish
Looking at my diamond confused, is it fluid?
Out of town bags, but you know a nigga flew em
Skippa da Flippa, he dropping bricks of at Newmans
Plug is an alien, my plug not a human

[Hook][Produced by DJ Spinz & Dun Deal]

[Verse]
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think

You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

[Hook] x4[Chorus]
I could fuck yo bitch
Make a hit (on my day to day)
Maybe roll a spliff and get lit (on my day to day)
You know Im legit, With the shits (on my day to day)
Looking up above fall in love (on my day to day)

[Verse 1: Michael Christmas]
I think the illuminati just followed me on twitter
I think they see my day to day is making waves amazing babes
I do the shows they say my name like Kelly Rowland Beyoncé
, I need not pay no mind to they lil comments if they hate they hate
Like who could tell me different, get off my vas deferens
Day to day from daily one year later still ain't no vast difference
Eating breakfast at Tiffany's, lunch with Leila, then my mom came and woke me, it fucked my day up

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Day to Day (x8)

[Verse 2: Tunji Ige]
Tell me all the I can things do
Wrote a couple songs about you
Cruising in the burbs
These Cul-de-sacs Will bring you blues
Said you just wanna be free
Might as well come follow me
Take you to my other home
In the heart of the city
Now you know that you bad
Know know that you bad
And I hate to see you sad
Gave you every thing I had but
In a basement in Pennsylvania
Writing songs of my heart just entertain ya (singing)

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ILoveMakonnen]
I hit the club with techno girls they really love the ecstasy
They say Makonnen your the one that I only want next to me
Your sex and love is all I need and plus you keep the best weed
Your friends are really super cool like Mikey Christmas and Tunji
Use me, abuse me, and take all my love away
I don't really care what you really want to do today
So lets have some fun tonights not promised to me or you tonight
But I really don't wanna loose this time right now so…

[Chorus][Intro: I Love Makonnen]
I got gas on deck and you know that fool
I get everybody high in your middle school

I'm riding 'round the city with the packs fucking servin'

If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
So I'm out here in the streets trynna make some more dough
If I ain't in the streets, then I'm in the studio
And when I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail
When I'm in the streets, you know I'm dodgin 12
Because me and my friends don't go to jail

[Bridge: I Love Makonnen]
Out here got a new one

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
In the kitchen, grab the fork, water work, I'm whippin' that
Trap house, lotta weight, people say I'm gettin' fat

Stomped with my Timberlands, I shoot him with my FN
Know that I got good aim, might shoot him with my left hand
Find out his beef then I'm pullin' up in a huntin' van
Bitches sayin' I'm the man, walk around with a 100 bands

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

[Verse 3: Yung Gleesh]

So many places that I’d rather be
So many faces that I’d rather see
People gonna come for me
Want to lock me in the slums and be
On the low for life
I don’t know if I’m gon do it right

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – ILoveMakonnen]
I had to keep it, on my own
In my mind, keep it growing

That your shit would never get played

Cause that shit you giving is some hot stuff
They really want that, fly me out to Belgium
I need some new stacks, they like we got em
So hold up, like where your cash at
You smoking weed now, but where the hash at
Like where the dope at, least we can do it fast
You want to do some new new, then where some coke at

I let em find out on their own
Cause I remember when I was home

[Hook]

[Verse 1]

Every night I pray to God they made it to heaven(yeah)

Having visions that I'm leaving in a hearse,next

[Chorus 2]
But I've been down for so long
And I've been keeping it too real

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
I'm leaving New York, I don't wanna pay the tax
I move to Monaco but now I can't relax
I hate myself, I think Americans are whack
But other countries leave me feeling weird like afternoon naps
Summer 2014
Shmoney dancing with some goth teens
Motherfuckers leaking nudes
Why they got to be so rude?
I lost my samurai, feel like a fucking rōnin
And now my only friends are Despot and Makonnen
Gonna spend the fall buying jackets at the mall
Gonna spend the winter fucking frozen in a crystal ball
Went to the Hamptons and I thought I was the man
'Til Mary-Kate said my Ray Bans were off-brand
I kept my mouth shut and I shook Sarkozy's hand
Spit in the ocean, stole a handful of the sand, damn, damn

[Bridge: Despot]
I'm 'bout to right these old wrongs
But not until I get a few mill'
And I been counting so long
Them dead presidents are skeletons on new bills

[Verse 3: Despot]
Up on the block again but down on my luck
If you buying I got whatever I can sell for a buck
And I got it for so cheap you'd think it fell off a truck
Now them pockets is so deep they try to run 'em and sunk
Rocks in socks, I got cold feet but still married the game, I'm stuck
So I'm dodging the police, I'm out here running duckin' cuffs
I ain't getting any sleep, these motherfuckers keep me up
Didn't know what day it was, until the club was going up
I ain't slept a wink, my brain's on the blink
The fizz in my drink got a strange tint of pink
It's all getting pissed down the drain in the sink
It is what it is, but it ain't what you think
Put a price tag on your life, going once, going twice
Go bust off the culture cyph(er) and blame it on the poltergeist
Alibis is golden so I fold 'em like it's poker night
Got the whistleblowers tight like I just boned the coach's wife
Birds is chirping perfect 'til I shoot 'em out the sky in flight
Chop 'em up and serve 'em on your turf
You know you heard me right
Got a way with words, you lucky you got away with your life
Not afraid to burn the bridge,  it's shady, I could use the light

[Pre-Chorus: Despot]
Now everybody's on one
I trying to get 'em on at least two
Keep saying it's your last one
Nobody's ever gon' believe you

[Chorus/Outro: Makonnen][Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Young, whip it, chef, time, get it
Boy I'm back, hold up
Yeah

[Verse]
I just might pull up on your pack and sell that
Young niggas be talking shit, but love my dro, they smell that
Call me on my old phone, nigga, I can't answer
Said you smoking on them cigarettes, I hope you dancing
Round in the town, with them new things
Young boys got blue things
Fuckin' with some new pills, heard they come from China man
Said you got some ecstasy, my niggas tryna get next to me
Bitches out here talking shit but I'm be in Texas, g
All on the weekends, sipping, swerving, leaning
All my shit the best shit, nigga what you meaning
We don't need no features boy, I'm out here being teacher boy
Skyping on your teacher, FaceTime and Snapchat and that
I be smoking dro, on the pole, what the fuck you know
I be in the streets, here for shows, tryna get my dough
Cause I need more, I need more than these fucking shows
Really tryna' pay, tryna' see, 30k a day
Back up on the block again
I got some blocks for my friends
They ain't doing shit but hanging out, in the woods trapping
Tryna' make this shit, who gives a damn about what I'm rapping
Long as that money coming back then they be gift wrapping
On Christmas trees, God dammit, what you need
I'm that nigga round the town like Frosty
Keep that white on my nose, keep that nose on my white
I got a princess, that bitch look like Snow White
Cause we ride around with George crew
All my boys like 5'2
All they come around and have that fuckin' AK on them too
Young niggas getting mad cause they be out here losing dads
Getting locked in fuckin' jail, and they gon' fuckin' break their cell
I'm back up with it too
Heard you tryna' get it too
I got like, 22
Left going all for two
If you want them, come and get them
Cause we really need it
I'm just giving something that, I need boy
I'm tired as fuck, I just need some coke
I'mma do another bump and tell all my jokes
On these fucking beats and make it go on my mixtape
Motherfuckers like "God damn, he's so great"
See me on that documentary, bitch, shout out that Noisey lab
See me on my two-way, this the loudest I can see the trap
Oh God damn, we be getting fucking super wild
Doing shrooms and LSD
Book the kid for boats now
Young boat party, Makonnen like to party
All off out here in the pool, like Lombardi
I be out here in New York, niggas where your shawty
Fucking with them Yankees, motherfuckers come and saw me
Uh, in that drop top, I don't even drop tops
My friends got BMWs that look like space drops
Oh, God damn, niggas like uncle sam be calling me on my phone
Like "God damn, you owe a spare"
I don't owe you shit, nigga
I'm just gonna take that shit
Spend it all on bricks
Make it back and probably take a bitch
Out, to Atlanta or I'll probably be Italy
Young niggas like that pasta, yeah they fucking cook for me

[Outro]
I'm done. (laughs)[Hook x2]
Why you tricking that? She ain't exclusive news
She only care about the money, she don't care 'bout you
Why you chasing that? She ain't exclusive news
She only care about the money, she don't care 'bout you
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no
She ain't exclusive, she ain't exclusive, no

[Verse 1]
I had to swerve on the bitch, cause I'm 'bout my dollars
That's that same nasty bitch in that dirty Impala
I'm all in every city cause I'm 'bout my dough
That ho used to fuck with Dan Marino
She ride your wave like a dolphin till you lay in the coffin
She always silent in the house but in the streets just talking
Better off passing her to one of your bros
You can't be sad in the streets when we don't love them hoes

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Why you tricking that? Why you chasing that?
Why you tricking that? She ain't exclusive[Hook: ILOVEMAKONNEN]

[Intro: Trinidad James]
Hey you, man in the mirror
Livin' for love and the music, shoes, clothes, and the women
You know the usual
Might do a shroom, I'm in love with the losers
The industry a joke, I guess that's why I feel so bamboozled

[Hook: I Love Makonnen]
When it comes to the money, you've been making too much
Comes to the honeys, you've been pimping too much
Speaking of your friends, faking too much
But all I wanna know-ow
Is why they hating on me, hating on me
All I wanna know is why they hating on me
Hating on me, hating on me
All I wanna know-ow

[Verse 1: Trinidad James + (I Love Makonnen)]
To these hoes, I ain't focused
To these niggas I'm the coldest
Since (?) had his ass out, since (?) was open
I'mma old school Atlanta nigga, golds and the Forces
Trapped in this world nigga, by goals and misfortunes
My momma ain't rich, what the fuck you think?
(What the fuck you think?)
That I'mma just stop because the shit you're sayin'?
(Shit you're sayin')
Oh that I'mma just stop because these niggas hatin'?
(I'd rather die a real nigga than to live a fake
I'd rather die a real nigga than to live a fake)
I'd rather die a real nigga than to live a fake

[Interlude: Trinidad James]
I can't let these fuck niggas get the best of me
How I deal with the hate, how I stay at peace that's what they wondering, is what they asking
Smile in the face, with a bird in your pocket, that's the recipe

[Hook: I Love Makonnen]

[Verse 2: I Love Makonnen]
Ballin', I've been playing these fools
And I'mma keep doing what I do
Is it cause they stallin'?
They've been looking at the news, tryna see if they can find you
Must have heard I'm the newness, bringing bitches through this
Bringing (?) motherfuck the (?)
(?) then motherfuck the (?) girl
Is it cause I'm in the city boomin' but I'm livin' on the south side
Hidin' things, pullin' up, right here smokin' outside
Mr. International, the city towns we run about
Ban me from the studios? We still make hits at Sonny house

[Prehook + Hook]

[Verse 3 – ILoveMakonnen]
Balling, I been playing these fools
And Imma keep doing what I do

They been looking up the news
Tryna see if they can find you
Must've heard I'm the newness, bringing bitches through this
Hanging on the song like some motherfucking nooses
Say you’re getting more, then motherfucking choose this

[Verse 1]
OG pimping, trench coat mobbing
Money keep flowing from the bity to Bompton
West coast Makonnen, the best thing going
They really like my movies, it's the best thing showing
Boss Hogg playing, competition slaying
Sell the whole pack then relax before the day end
Making hella, mula', give a damn about your jeweler
Shouts out west Baltimore and free young moolah

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Haters can't see us, Nish or Taniya
We be in L.A. posting like the coliseum
Big smoking, PCH coasting

Old friend been down since New Life Academy
Now we bound to the dough, it all make sense
Own our own homes we ain't gotta pay rent

Pineapple with a little bit of juice
Your girl over there, you know she gon' choose

Eat these chumps up, and spit 'em back out
I'm the hottest mothafucka in the north and the south now

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]

Spend it all at the bank
Put it all on dank
