[Verse 1: Eyedea]
A prince in practice moans for the attention that he wants
But most of this town won't even dignify his ignorance with a response
Left to a crowded foster home by a 15-year-old mom
Never been held in anyone's arms; when you've never been moved it's really hard to move on
A young saleswoman sets up shop when the sun sets
She'll make your wildest dreams come true at a price you won't forget
The sadly-married set up alibis: no harm, no regret
Hoping they meet an angel in bed that can wrestle the devil right out of their heads
This city runs fast, no one has time to sit with themselves
No time to look into our pain or see the same despair in everyone else
It's here, it's there, it's everywhere - tears soak each card the dealer's dealt
But time taught me how to see every second as Heaven even though they're perfectly disguised as Hell
And I refuse to let past bruises cover the light
It ain't all good, but it's all good enough so I know I'm alright
Agony is truth: it's our connection to the living
I accept it as perfection and keep on existing in the now

[Hook: Eyedea]
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling but no matter how hard I hit the ground
...I'll still smile
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling but no matter how hard I hit the ground
...I'll still smile

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Ear-to-ear, as if that's all I'm here for
Despite the wars founded by the rich, funded by the poor
Kids barely eighteen are dying so billionaires can make more
Elsewhere hungry mothers watch their babies starve to death in a beat-up shack on a dirt floor
The aged professor quotes, "freedom's without a path"
Now he dresses like a widow, and preaches "Love is dead" in every class
But curiosity killed the cat and taught the dog in him how to act
And it burned his bridge to Jill so he tries to drown the guilt with a bottle of Jack
Self-proclaimed rebels say "We must oppose the system"
"You gotta take a stand - if you're not against 'em you're with 'em"
Signs read "Support the troops" "Bring 'em home" "No more innocent victims"
But when a homeless veteran asks for spare change you're too busy protesting to even listen
And I'm no different; I live in conflict and contradiction
But it can be so beautiful when I don't reject what lies within
It's beautiful the way agony connects us to the living
I think of the world when I hurt, and keep on existing in the now

[Hook: Eyedea]
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling but no matter how hard I hit the ground
...I'll still smile
I can only build if I tear the walls down
Even if it breaks me I won't let it make me frown
I'm falling but no matter how hard I hit the ground
...I'll still smile[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Oh how easily they forget no anchor to the past
Cut the blood supply and hope the heart beats itself to death
My ribcage is now my own it still feels like your arms neck clothed in salt
How'd I let it go this far?
It happens faster than you could ever think
From always and forever to never again in less than a blink
The river runs until it's dry
But I die spitting my last drip into it's mouth to keep it alive
Long drives, wide eyes, and your smiling face
You dance I drink, let's waste the night away
They say you always know right away
But you can't foresee your sand being pulled into the sea under a tidal wave
Secrets leak out when you're asleep
Coming from a queen's mouth, talk isn't all that cheap
I'm now a lone flame searching for a purpose
Setting fires everywhere I go, can't avoid the burns
We shared pain
You took me by the throat and made me understand the world as if I were you and I couldn't breathe
Now you can lead a horse to fresh water but you can't teach it how to be okay when you decide to leave
I'm lost, there's no one to protect
I got so used to being shelter from the rain that always followed you
It's not my first time, actually it's nothin new
But that doesn't make it any easier to get through
The snow won't melt, smoke won't clear
Turned hope inside out a thousand times trying to see if it was ever anything more than dressed up fear
But the two go hand in hand you can't have one without the other being there
I'm barely breathing waiting for the spins to end
Begging a god I don't believe in to let me sleep so I can dream again
We went through thick and thin
Came out separate on the other end
But please know no matter what you'll always have me as a friend
And I finally know
Your crime is your pride and your past is my only ghost
I'm going crazy out of my control
But there's nothing I can do, I have no choice but to let it go
Each day gets a little less intense
I no longer feel like there's someone standing on my chest
You made me more me, and I won't forget the times you helped my find my feet
When I was buried in my head
Thank you, for giving what you had to give
Taking what you had to take
And making me believe in you
Even though I might be gone forever there will always be a place in my brain that will think of you
You look so graceful when you're flying
Keep going, there's a lot of world that you haven't seen
You have my best wishes, even if only in silence, you deserve everything that you've ever dreamed
The snow melted right when the smoke cleared
I turned love inside out a thousand times trying to see if it was ever anything more than the will to persevere
But the two go hand in hand, the clouds surrounding you eventually will clear
I can breathe I found contentment in the end
Telling a god I don't believe in to go to sleep so I can think again
We went through thick and thin
Came out separate on the other end
But please know no matter what you'll always have me as a friend[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing me that I was him
We like to feel the blood and fat dripping off our gums
She likes to talk directly down the barrel of her gun
Learning to perfect the ancient art of quiet rape
You've always been so warm and calculated, I owe you a thanks
Eyes wide shut, I promise not to fall awake
Lick the guillotine and tell you how the gasoline tastes
The grass is always greener on the other pesticide
Solemn precious crept through the mess to shed it's infectious high
What's for me to know and you to find
Guilty, the almighty praised adrenaline
Such an underwhelming thrill
Where there's a will there's a wake
Burn me at the stake
Who the hell am I trying to fool?
I'm a fool, I feel so fake
One last goodbye before I take my .45
Shoot a hole in the sky, rip it open
And climb inside

[Hook: Eyedea]
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me

[Bridge]
Tie me down till my sweet nothing's sour
I screwed up trying to squeeze 65 minutes from an hour
Outnumbered by such a large amount
No wonder why we lost the battle, the counter-culture can't count

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Welcome to my private hell
There's no one to fight now, enjoy myself
I'd rather drown than ask for help
I wish I was someone else
Mr. Perfect, Misconstrued
Lead the way, follow through
You probably hate me, I do too
You're so much like me I feel sorry for you
But I think you're pretty, pretty sure
You will profit, you will get hurt
I eat my words they taste like dirt
I'm only ashamed because I know what it's worth
Find my comfort inside blame
Shove my pride back down my face
My worst habit's waking up at least once a day
Balance barefoot on a needle heaven's just a jump away

[Hook]I stand alone
Burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
A stronger tide is coming, I've been running
Trying to function fine without my mind
Climbing out this fucking corner
I was born a thorn away from the rotten petals
A forgotten rebel craft in the absence of heaven's heavy hands
To develop an evident level of benevolence
So it's probably better I sold my soul to the devil
This is a message to anyone I've met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand none of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, look Mom no cuts
Just a stomach in disgust, and the fear
That I might go nuts this year
If I don't slow up I'll see you one my way
One day this shit'll kill me but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all faith in a world so full of hate
And I don't fucking love music I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
And putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to be awake
Introducing the corroded bones I hide behind my smile
I'm angry at the universe for the way she treats me now
And keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity
Not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze
The real imprinted Hansen's disease
Not healing in this century, I'm kneeling to the entity
Who built this penitentiary, as filthy as a centipede
And guiltless in a sense cause he was willing to
Just let me bleed, While I wore a game face
In 10 years don't check for me I'll be in the same place
This planet's just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walk around constitutes another obstacle
So here it is, I'm finally coming out my shell
All 19 years of my life have been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure about every facet of my existence
From my addictions, to the condition I choose to live in
Who you kidding, I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind
And I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
But I've been fine disregarding my insanity
Every form of art isolates you from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
So fuck education for a decade and 3 years
Of headaches from my peers
Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow, everything that keeps me whole
Everything that ever meant anything to Eyedea
So I leap with golden hope to rip the leash that holds my focus
But the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 feet or 100 feet
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
So people say I've changed, and it's harder to relate to me
Good, I never liked you our friendship was make believe
I'm peeling the mask back and revealing the rap that's been
Filling my organs drilling short distorted portions
Of morbid masochistic torture that unfortunately crafted
An interest to orbit my portrait and inflict my image with disorder
The minutes get shorter, walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on by one clothespin
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look alright but on the inside its so wrong
I want life to change but I don't know if it can
For a man or machine or whatever the fuck I am
I stand alone burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
You want to die my life well come and stay in madness's favorite little corner
Cause even Shadows have Shadows
And my secrets are eating me
Eagerly feeding to scream my dreams away
But they keep on defeating me
(Even shadows have shadows)
Welcome to the dusty subconscious of an actor
Who murdered his childhood to stop the audience's laughter
(Even shadows have shadows)
How am I to break free from my fears
When I don't like what I see
And I can't feel what I hear?
(Even shadows have shadows)
So don't judge my book by its cover
Cause my story's just as fucked up as any other!There is a way out of this mess and shit
You just can’t think your way out of it
Thought is your enemy
I know I know, I got to think less. I had that thought actually
You have to let go. Let go
Let go of what? Let go of you
I mean, think about it, what have you done for you lately?
I’m having trouble following your philosophy
You have to jump in. Jump in by those scopes?
No, in the water. In the River?
Yes, Jump in the River, Jump in the River…

Were all born into this river without knowing how to swim
And eventually we learn how to keep the water under our chins
Some times this river is so cold to be in
Freezing my soul, solidifying my skin
Regardless of how far I see, I never see my travels end
We're carried by the current, being driven by the wind
The scenery we pass, we'll never see again
So we store it up as memories and don't let go of them
Were under a spell thinking the river should go straight
We set goals and desires to control our own fate
But all the pain we experience is a result of our expectations
Because it's the rivers nature to twist and turn
The shit can burn
And I know it
I have the same conflict
But I try to sit and flow with this rivers natural process
And sometimes when I watch myself float downstream
I see the beauty of it all, and it feels like a dream
And at that time I appreciate the rivers course
Some call it God, reality, momentum, force
I stare up at the naked moon, and she stares down at me
Outside false boundaries I’m all I look outward to see
The universe is not something separate from yourself
I know you feel alone, but that's why I'm here to help
I know you feel alone, but just look up at the stars
And everything that is out there is what you really are

We gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life
Everyone has different pasts and we're seeking the light
The world is divided between peasants and kings
But the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing
Now I want you to know
The role you play is part of the whole
Without you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion
So if you need anything, I mean anything at all
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
I'm here for you, in the same way that you're here for me
Each person in an intricate piece of infinity
I feel that if you could see what I see
Then we as humanity could be free
I'm here for you, not for any self centered reasons
Because existence is interdependent and all's related
Connected in its different manifestations of one single mind
You ain't isolated from the world even though it feels like that sometimes

I see the hurt when I look into your eyes
How you struggle to hold it and keep in bundled inside
It drives a dull blade deep in my heart; it makes me want to cry
So I offer you a hand to help wash away the rainy skies
I'm running out of words, but I haven't yet made my message clear
So if none of this makes sense, I just want you to know I'm here
As a musician, as a friend, as a teacher, as a student
To grow and realize that everything's in constant movement
Each problem that we face is just a part of this movement
It seems helpless, but if we stick together we'll get through it
And return to the essence from which we've been uprooted
And wake humanity from these illusions
The second you can look into the sky and see your own reflection
You know your head is in the right direction
The river riding always moves, but with it I live
And everything is perfect, just the way it is

We gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life
Everyone has different pasts and we're seeking the light
The world is divided between peasants and kings
But the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing
Now I want you to know
The role you play is part of the whole
Without you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion
So if you need anything, I mean anything at all
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man

Everything's cool as I float downstream 21x[Intro]
To hell with the kind of work you have to do to earn a living
All it does is fill the bellies of the pigs who exploit us
Look at me, I'm makin' it. I may live badly
But at least I don't have to work to do it
To all you workers out there: Every single commodity you produce
Is a piece of your own death!
End of interview!

[Verse 1]
I'm so goddamn tired, can't tell if I'm done, or just un-inspired
And don't give me that you can be somebody speech
That ain't your place, let me be
I'm an example of a candle lit life
With electric relaxation, brain trampled by devotion
To remote control channel changin
Something provoked the whole globe to lower expectations
Damn, what's wrong with my generation?
We was the cream of the crop but it seems we've been robbed
That's what happens when you trade in all your dreams for a job
And every day it gets less and less exciting
I would make a difference but I'm busy faking this instead of trying
Change my shift from now to never and I'll pretend I'm fine
Why am I always stuck at the shitty end of the assembly line
I guess I'm built to be intoxicated with hope
Sometimes it's a journey, most of the time it's just a bad joke
And in my skull there's a junk drawer I can't organize
The first to come in last to leave we'll never be immortalized
This sort of life is completely overrated, I'm sick of being the
Only one I know that's trying to make it
So right now I'm heading home, got Sounds of Nature Volume 1 in
My headphones and half a bottle of prednisone
That's the reaction to an overdose of passion
Brainless, stagnant...ain't it magic?

[Verse 2]
I never knew ambition could be so fuckin disgusting
I earn a good comission but it makes me feel so ugly
I'm on some not even knowing I'm an illuminatus just as long
As playin agent don't disrupt my funerals progress
I ain't changin for you I ain't reaching for the sky, I would
If you could give me one good reason why I should even try
Because after a while this never ending lame game of what's better
Could fracture your smiles mainframe forever
It's so fun to be in love..or so I've heard
The meaning has no feeling even though I understand the words
I used to try to make heaven right here on earth but that'll only
Happen if you find someone else to do the work
I'll be suprised when my psychosis turns out to keep the driving focus
While I hold the same blurred cloud as burnt out dope heads
So for now my worthless counterwork has found a purpose everytime a pound of dirt produced I get my frown refurbished
Two for one specials, if you order shoulder devils, head swoll
Running out of petrol but I won't let go of this gas pedal
Till I'm settled and they finally wet me with that sweet blind security
So insecure and messy, mark today the day that dedication died
Instead of saying goodbye, I'm staying praying that'll I'll stay alive
Because even though I know I hate to love you so much
I got no better place to go, that's why I always show up

[Outro - sample from Altered States]
- You're getting a divorce
- We're getting separated. We probably won't get around
To the divorce until next year
- I know it's none of my business, but why? You're married to one of the great women of the world who adores you. My God, if anybody has it made, you have
- She insists she's in love with me, whatever that is. What she means is she prefers the senseless pain we inflict on each other to the pain we would otherwise inflict on ourselves. But I'm not afraid of that solitary pain. In fact, if I don't strip myself of all this clatter and clutter and ridiculous ritual, I shall go out of my fucking mind. Does that answer your question?
- What question was that?
- You asked me why I was getting divorced
- Oh, listen, it's your life. I'm sorry I even asked
- Listen[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Veins like a roadmap, black cold grasp on a throat that
Won’t hold back old habit, Kodak moments go past
I wrote stains on a toe-tag, old man made me so sad
That no taste of the Cognac or Prozac antidote, twist my skull
Off with his head, head like a hole Nine Inch Nails pressed to the bone
Exit alone, try and fail, I’ve inhaled dead to the world
Ethanol on your pedestal, churn chemical burns
Hurt worse than skeletal, so skeptical at first, perfect
Cursive in Hell, sweet silver bells all seem to say "Please go away”
Demons will play, eating away, new young and old, food for the soul-
Less that you know, the less that you feel
I'm cursed with intelligence I can't heal
Kneel, kill, death to the bourgeois, proletariat with the new song
Noose on a bony neck, loneliness, opiate and a bruised jaw
Allah’s not, nobody owns me, no job, robot, no cold feet
No God, only strong no home, no soul sold so-so so long

[Hook: Lotte Kestner]
Watch the paint peel
Slow as the burn you feel
Break the heart you never should've
You can bury anything
In the woods

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I'm a live wire in a dead world, I'm a good boy, but I'm a better girl
Eyes closed, finger on the trigger, one inch different I'm free
You’re a widow, liquor liver, Suboxone under my tongue
Private numb, one more time for dying young
I had fun, watching father try to run, but he left a black hole inside his son
If we're being Frank, I'm an average Joe, cop shop
Jake and Johnny, Jack and Coke, your tsunami of only
Honestly couldn't even reach the back row
So how do you expect to drown me, dumbfound me or harm me
You and what army, are we clear, I'm here
In a rearview mirror, coming to a theater near you
To steer you away from your fears, stage bound
Usually it's break-a-leg, she told me to break a heart
I didn't know what to say exactly so I walked away
And later thought I should've at least told her thanks
But that's how that goes, where the grass grows
There’s a past in the time capsule, I'm attracted to its shadow
Every last drip 'til I'm flat broke
Let’s make this storm feel clean, coward man war machine
Sour plans, plots and schemes, ripened fruit, rotten dreams
Thoughtlessly, I told a lie, nothing I won't do to save my own behind
I'm a live wire burning dead inside
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead, I'm not dead until I've died

[Outro: Eyedea]
Yeah, cut your wrists on a blade of glass
I can't change my past but I can kiss the now and make it last
Take out the trash, crash, burn, another relapse
Turn rehashed meat perhaps

You know what I'm talkin' about, E&A don't play that shit man
*Why don't you explain?* Alright, check it out...

[Eyedea]
It's like we walk into the place and instantly we surrounded
The kingpin, big shots, of this underground shit
In less than a sec Abilities is at the bar
Half these guys don't even know who we are, but we still act like stars
Your set could'a been tight, I wasn't listenin'
I was peepin' out some new lyrics my man Carnage was kickin'

[Carnage]
Forcin' this contortionist towards blowin' kids
Physicals over inproportionate coordinates (..damn that shit is hot)

[Eyedea]
Now back to the subject, to me not givin' a damn about you
This is my world, it just so happens that you live in it too
But that don't mean I gotta tolerate your talk
There's a thousand other people in this room
That'd probably love to hear your thoughts
But while your uncomfortably ridin' my tip
Abilities is upstairs stealin' yo chick
You want props, stop runnin' your mouth
Just give a pound, buy a CD, and be out
Yo, you need to take a few steps back
Your DJ can't scratch and your emcee can't rap
You all up in my face and we just came here to max
Man you stupid motherfuckers need to learn how to act

"Ayo, ain't that that Eyedea kid, talkin' all that crazy..
Man I'm 'bout to hyperbolate this fool, you can't see me!"

Ever since we started winnin' battles and travelin' 'cross the land
Fools think if they could beat you they could beat you and
They wanna test so they step not knowin Eyedea's rep to leave 'em swept
Up off they feet, the contest always ends like this:
-Your cheap flimsy chump style ain't worth the ground it'll get buried beneath
-The beats are buckin' your weak, flowin' your flow is scared of the beat(?)
-Princess, the king's here so play the background
-How's that sound? You just got clowned now sit your ass down
Man these kids get on my nerves, but I can't pretend I hate 'em
Cause whack emcees are such a great source of entertainment
Me and Abilities watched the Blaze Battles for like a year:
"This kid out there, got nothin' to do"
Heh, it's funny, sometime's kids is so whack with the rappin
Instead of actually rappin' back I just wind up laughin' like
*haha haha haha ha haha ha haha ha ha ha*
Yo, you need to take a couple steps back
Your partner can't scratch, and your cousin can't rap
You all up in my face and we just came here to max
Man you stupid motherfuckers need to learn how to act

"Oh my God, Eyedea & Abilities, you guys are soo phat!
My boyfriend loves you guys soo much
You know what? Oh my God, you should sign my tits
Oh great, this is gonna be perfect!"

You know we love to see ya'll at the shows
But this is dedicated to the ones someone might call a *ho*
All I gotta do is wink to get you back to my hotel
I can't respect a person that don't respect themselves
You're that one girl I went to highschool with
Back then you treated me like I wasn't shit
You say if I give you a free CD you'll show me your tits?
You get the CD for ten bucks like everyone else you stupid *bi-yotch*
*No* I don't care if you just broke up with your boyfriend *No*
I ain't tryin' to go where every other rapper's been *No*
If I was to kick it all my boys would clown so I could
*Never hold you, can't hold you, won't hold you down*
Look all you gotta do is learn some manners
Women and men, DJs and rappers
There's nothin' more to say, this meeting is adjourned
And if you don't know by now *I think it's time you learned*[yo does somebody know where I am?, pssst yo can
Somebody please tell me where I am, somebody please]

Yeah I could feel your heart pulsing, from this side of the room
I could fulfill the emptiness that consumes your body, watch me bloom
As soon as Scottie beams me down to this place that I just clowned yelling:
“Yo, where the fuck am I?”
Excuse me sir, I got stuck when I drove my truck over this pile of sitting duck
MC’s getting crushed here, pieces of head from the treads of my good-year
Would there be anyway that you can lend a hand to demand an abstract land where
Mic’s, turn-tables and spray-cans stop the main man?
Through my brain jammed I may stand in the village of the damned
But I spend my energy like cash trying to escape this toxic wasteland
I've got to face the enemies that pass the line of symmetry
Welcome to the rhyme penitentiary
For centuries MC’s were aware of my name
Stands on the bare naked, un-carved block of hip-hop
From this side of the room a heart to hearts inside (your mind)
Listen I’ve decided to doomed, I cry when it’s noon cause they poison the food for thought
For now it’s silent but soon the voices in my head would talk
I try to assume I could really trust the people I listen to
But they get all their information off that shit talking box that sits in the living room
I fly to the moon and back every time I close my eyes
Every rhyme I wrote floats the sky the sky’s in a mushroom cloud
Formation made from atom bomb explosion, blocking emotion
Light bluer eyes from a potion, corrupted mental puss puddles
Each family contains: ink stains
Contaminated brains, dead cells and mutilated veins
Who created pain? What the hell is insanity?
An unpopular perception of reality brought to society?
I try to behave, and act like a slave and walk in the direction I’m told on the roads that they paved
One day I’ll escape incarceration
But until then I’m just a sick worn out voice mental patient. (x3 layered)
Just a sore throat, worn out voice mental patient
[Come on, where am I?]

It’s beautiful in here, wouldn't you agree?
What you hear and what you see is manipulated by music
Loosens, induces your fear
You've obviously lost your marbles
Only the insane hear your lyrics stimulate the mind, the mind (above time?)
The mind absorbs and analyzes sound as it floats from headphones when your lonesome
No ones around, and your spines tingling, goosebumps, shivering, quivering
It’s creepy, I’m sleepy, leave me the fuck alone
Turn off the phone, my dome is beeping
I’m enclosed in 4 bleeding walls I call this home Eyedea zone
My speech just roams in search for peace
Bouncing off your thoughts as words secretes
Stomach acid gastric juices digesting the lining of your intestines inclining up, up, up
I must be claustrophobic at a pause with flows for vocal
Aerobic practice to keep me occupied before the closet opens
Unlocks in motion, need to focus my potent toxins through talking and neck Walkman
Eye’s so on

So I’ma explain what I am simple and plain
No human, but just a voice invented to play a mental game
You visualize brown eyes, baggy jeans
Earth dwelling B-boy reading graffiti magazines
Smoking beaties, grabbing mic’s
Chilling at the bus stop and kicking flows, but you got twisted:
I’m just a voice, I have no physical position
Since you know me only through what was said:
I’m just a voice and all along this song could been all in your head
All in your head
That’s right, this song, all in your head/mind

In reality, I’ma mortify on what upsets me that many
Dis-grilled the real vinyl brain tissue memory deal with me
I’ma be around till the end of time in reality no else
Hears me
I’m all in your mind(x2)

[…and I think you’re losing it](Spoken)
That's him in the corner of social oblivion
Encompassed by the sweet sense of freedom
That only borders the aura of deep cerebral gouges
Buried in each beat of the heart he was once proud to home
If only his substance held a higher level of potence
He might be able to drown the portion of his mind
Which is trapped in the infinite hoard
Of his 1972 through '74 tour through the flames of this hell

Sometimes gunfire is brighter than the sunshine
And sometimes a child's scream influences every dream
Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking we've moved on
But no way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen

It's now twenty-five years later, he's on the brink of forty-three
Still searching for sanity, surveying the floor of his distorted sea
He rememebers high-school friends joking about the war
Never knew what mom was crying for (Never knew what mom was crying for)
The other piece that shines in his mind was a divine first love
Sewn-made, beauty, brown-eyed queen he left behind
He remembers holding her tight, watching the sunset at shore
Never knew what she was crying for (Never knew what she was crying for)
He got the letter in the mail by the middle of his summer
Wouldn't have had to go if it wasn't for his newborn brother
He was barely eighteen, murdering people even younger
And he still ducks and covers every time he hears the thunder
He still hears the screams, smells the flesh, tastes the death
Sees the blood, feels the pain, what's to gain, nothing's left
But the slug that remains in his right calf
The bullet laughs every time he cries, and it drives him mad
Trying to sleep, but the visions give him a cold sweat
The war's been over for two decades, but he still hasn't been home yet
And every day he waits and strains to supress his guilt
And forget the horror and the violence; the "kill or be killed"
Fists, they always clenched; teeth, they always grinding
Real life is lost and in a bottle he tries to find it
"It's not fair," he mumbles through a nightmare
Only in a fight for two years and wound up spending his whole life there

(Chorus)
He was face to face with the devil for the welfare of his country
Now he's straining to live but his conscience won't let him
It ain't flashbacks, you have to understand the tragedy, see
He left the war, but the war never left him, see
He left the war, but the war never left him, see
He left the war, but the war never left him, see
He left the war, but the war never left him, see
He left the war...

It's now twenty-five years later, he's on the edge of a park bench
He asked God for hope and found his source non-existant
He sits in the shadows, because the sun burns no more
Now he knows what mom was crying for (Now he knows what mom was crying for)
I used to watch old man in the park
The sights slowly drove fright through my heart
Wishing I could help but not knowing where to start
I'd walk away, curse the world, gush some love and curse some more
Now you know who I've been crying for (Now you know who I've been crying
For)
He threw his medals in the river but they sunk alone
Put shades on his eyes to hide it from the warzone in the sky
He tried to slit his wrists about a month ago
But he's seen so much death, he's scared to life of suicide
If there was only some way he could escape this penitentiary
Goals get bigger and figures it'll chase away his memory
But the dreams only worsen, the scenes almost burst in
He recalls how training took away his right to be a person
Put a gun in his hand, left him to die for the land
The plan was the murder of man (The plan was the murder of man)
Politicians have a dispute to decide to send in troops
But the truth is they just don't understand (They just don't understand)
Now he's running out of time, and running out of energy
But 'til the last day he will fight for the murder of his memories
And although he never got rid of his dog-tags
He still wishes they'd have sent his parents an American flag instead of him

(Chorus)

Sometimes gunfire is brighter than the sunshine
And sometimes a child's scream influences every dream
Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking we've moved on
But no way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen
No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seenYou never heard me say it's easy to be positive
It's obvious, regardless of your problems you gotta live
There's probably no way I'll always be a candle
Cause on a cold day, I need a warm place to stand too
But my vision lets me know it's past my bedtime
It's all good, I got a fair chance to get mine
Only a week until the deadline
But I've been through a whole library of words
Trynna make hell and head rhyme
I'm just another voice confined to your background
But when I stood up they sat down, who got the last laugh now?
Let's push the manual, can't look back at when the hand shook
Stand on a planned book, forgotten and rottin' with the canned goods
They won't lend you a shoulder, they think we're miniscule wimps
I learned as I got older, it don't exactly get simpler
I'm breathin' the germs, I'm teachin' to learn
It'll be me and my mic until the scream is adjourned

[Hook]
Everybody has their troubles but that's life it is a struggle
And I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so I'mma be alright, alright?

I know it's hard to keep on thriving when you only feel like crying
But I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so we gon' be alright, alright?

Everyone's got issues, don't be pissed if I dismiss you
Man this is seri-, happiness leaves my fingertips too quick
And I wish you would quit resistin' the system
Sendin' missiles to my system repetition
But if you keep whittling on the same piece of wood one day it'll be gone
And I'll be stabbin' my palms for the last ten songs
If my passion strong, won't be lastin' long cause
I'm crafting lines without a mind to cast 'em on
Put my emotions in alphabetical order
I looked at the ocean and saw nothing but water
I needed to use the phone and didn't have a quarter
With my devotion I was able to motion forward
When you're out in the open you can still feel cornered
Haunted by the ghosts in the depths of your soul, tortured
Don't know where I'm going but I'mma head for the border
All I need is my close friends and a few supporters

[Hook]
Everybody has their troubles but that's life it is a struggle
And I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so I'mma be alright, alright?

I know it's hard to keep on thriving when you only feel like crying
But I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so you gon' be alright, alright?

People show no sympathy to your problems
They think it'll never happen to them
They're living in a fairy tale quite magical
When reality hits 'em, they got the nerve to complain
Like they're the only ones in the universe it ever happened to
Haven't you ever looked around and felt the frowns?
I smile now cause I know how to look up when I'm down
But it's hard to live in a rainstorm and pretend it's sunny
While we all live in the foundation of puppetry
I scream "revolution!" in attempts to make a difference
I see no solution to the sickness outside of listsenin'
Your eyes listen by descision
But to use my imagination will disrupt a few of the caskets that's awaitin'
So in my notebook there's a riddle and as I write I giggle in sorrow
Reflecting the painful grin, but don't think I'm laughin' at you

I ain't laughin' at you
The world's laughin' at you

[7x]
And I'm just laughin' at them


[Hook]
Everybody has their troubles but that's life it is a struggle
And I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so I'mma be alright, alright?

I know it's hard to keep on thriving when you only feel like crying
But I just wanted to shed a small light cause it ain't all good
But it's all good enough, so you gon' be alright, alright?

And he gon' be alright
And she gon' be alright
And they gon' be alright
We all gon' be alright
My ma gon' be alright
My pals gon' be alright
Your folks gon' be alright
My folks gon' be alright
And he gon' be alright
And she gon' be alright
And they gon' be alright
We all gon' be alright

Alright, alright[Eyedea]
I think this one looks like a fight, between a plate of fruit and my dads exercise bike
I bet if these ants dancing next to my head could fly that high
They would use that cloud as a bed

[Kristoff Krane]
But my dad said that bugs bite and fly with the wind
And if the sun isn't hung right then run like a fish
We could win if we both try to untie our fins
And climb that pine tree with the swing on it behind the fence

[Eyedea]
Alright, one, two, three, let's race, I bet that I can beat you there
Last time you ran faster than a grown up when we were here
Remember? I scraped my knee then got stung by a bumblebee
And the old man that lives behind the fence came out and yelled at me

[Kristoff Krane]
Of course I remember, Oh how could I forget?
He wrote my mom a letter and my daddy threw a fit
But this time will be better I promise as long as we're honest he'll give us permission
[Eyedea] Yeah he can't say no to a kid

[Hook: Kristoff Krane & Eyedea]
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's all puppy dog kisses and hugs
So fill my cup with cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleepovers
I don't wanna grow up if it means getting older

I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's all puppy dog kisses and hugs
So fill my cup with cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleepovers
No, I don't really wanna grow up if it means getting older

[Kristoff Krane]
See, what I really don't get is why the big kids never get grounded after playing ding dong ditch
And the slingshots look like mighty fun, wish that I had one
That way I could stand up to bullies, instead of trying to run

[Eyedea]
Yeah, and they always get the baseball cards from the policemen
Being tall don't make you smart
At least we can always find something to do
Like looking at the clouds with my best friend, That's you

[Kristoff Krane]
I'm not sure what to say, I'm just happy that we're small enough to look up at the sky and feel okay
And I'd be lying if I tried to say that I don't feel the same way as you do
So let's be on our way it's time to play

[Eyedea]
Oh, to the jungle gym or to the swimming pool
School's out forever
And I hope I'm never too cool to keep on making my life better
Whether 5, 25 or 80 as long as I'm alive I'm in love and forever changing

[Hook *Variation*]
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's kisses and a hug with love
Fill my cup with a bunch of good things that always feel alright
Cause I'm a little kid, we're all little kids on the inside

Never turn my back on a cupcake
Love mixed with kisses and a kitten with love
Now fill my cup full of cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleep-overs
I will never grow up, cause I'll never get older[Hook: Slug & Eyedea]
S: Here's to the friend's I've lost and the one's I've left
E: And here's to the ears that want something to digest
S: Here's to the small population that's got my back
E: And here's to the robots that can't see past white and black
S: Here's to the Newfie cuties, come and get me
E: And here's to the hometown hoodies in the twin city
S: Here's to my man Nool and his drunk friend Andrew

[Verse 1: Slug]
Here's to the good times, and the good rhymes
And every cat that shook my hand after I took his or he took mine
I put life in the mic - for what that's worth
Plus I turned out to be the type that always wants the last word
There ain't no pieces to a dream on my keychain
But I got the secrets of the ages, on the papers in my briefcase
And if I could see straight, I'd of drove myself home
And if you really was a B-boy you'd have a cell-phone
I seen my share of war, mess em' of their royalty
Watch the soldiers jump off the dock to test their buoyancy
Took a drink from the gauntlet and passed it left
And waited for the master of the class to catch they breath
Oh wow, now you got freestyles for days, right?
But a lot of cats that got flows can't write a song to save they life
And I can't figure out, what you're talking about
Try to do it - after you take your man's unit out your mouth

[Hook: Slug & Eyedea]
You tryna get paid, now that I understand
Cause if a man's to have a family then he has to have a plan
And I'll be damned if I do, and I'll be done if I don't
Still I keep my heart tucked under a thick winter coat

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
From this day on, I'll never be fooled by a fool
Always be cool with the rules, and never eat food by the pool
See, I'm not here for the amusement of you
I stare right through with a clue
And appear as the student's of who? No one
I asked Mr Notebook "do you care if I doodle for two minutes?"
I knew that he knew and he didn't refuse cause he's true
I neutered a few, went to the moon with a flute
Flew on a broom into the future and came back with a pair of shoes and a crew
Drew a blueprint of a new computer - super human
And opened my eyes and noticed that I was alone in my room on a stool
Yeah - I'm a loser. (Yeah, I'm a loser..) So why don't you kill me?
My tooth hurts - and due to your blood squirts my school shirts are filthy
Skills seep from a closed mouth - quilts keep the cold out
The hills steep - Let's roll south
Until we can prove worth, to the whole house cause really
My soul's mouth is ill see
It can move words, at, oh about two/thirds light speed
Silly, Mic's bleed, Fancy amounts of glow in the dark kool-aid
Which was the gas to drive over the hump of my flow and it starts today
You say life sucks, so you refuse to touch tomorrow
Read my bumper sticker, it says "death is better cause it sucks and swallows"

[Hook: Slug & Eyedea]
S: Here's to the kids that don't need me to tell them how to live
E: And here's to one's that have it all and still find it in the heart to give
S: Here's to my peeps that know to look before they leap
E: And here's to the lyrics and beats that makes life complete
S: Here's to all my folks that don't let life kill they hopes
E: Here's to the man with the mic in his hand that walked away with a sore throat

[Outro: Slug & Eyedea]
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Yeah, Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
S: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me
E: Here's to you, and here's to them, and here's to me

[Dialogue]
Slug: Ayo, Nool. Was that best kind?
Nool: Yeah man, that was best kind
Eyedea: Yo man, What is best kind?[Verse 1]
You know the type of girl that walks in front of you and makes your jaw drop?
She talks in riddles, and sort of tickles your soft spot
You see her in the club. She treats you like a scrub
She ain't trippin' off you, she got your whole crew in love
You're day dreamin' of getting her in the bedroom alone
Straight fiendin', You's beg like a dog for the bone
And she's peepin', and the reason is she knows
Theres a demon in between your legs with a mind of its own
Now, you're a weakling, overwhelmed with hormones
Y'all start speakin', she grabs the number to your phone
And next weekend you invite her to your home
You weren't even thinking. You got played by a pro
She's a big shot. Thick lips, nice legs, green eyes
Took advantage of a thousand. Only slept with three guys
Ain't a ho or a groupie. Jane Doe or a Lucy
Her innocent looks are deceiving, so I'm telling you to be wise
I know she's a cutie, but she goes for the loot G
I know she sounded sincere, she even made me cry
Ayo don't think im goofy, but there's power in that coochie
Underneath those booty tight, cutoff, daisy-dooksy Levi's

[Hook]
She's a big shot. You know your dream girl
She knows how to use her looks to take advantage of the world
She's a big shot. You thought you could school her
She dissed you like you were neutered, and told you to go get a sexual tutor
She's a big shot. She wouldn't touch your ruler
She's so beutiful. A cute but cruel looter, user and abuser
She's a big shot. Your eyes are glued to her behind
You know her steez, but you fall for it every time

[Verse 2]
Now, what about that popular school kid?
The always have been, always will be cool kid?
The class president valedictorian. "A plus", star quaterback
Cadillac convertible drivin', signin' cheerleaders autorgraphs
The letter on the jacket. Medal around the neck
Pin on his chest, and mind on his rep
He only dates models. Drinks his Summit from the bottle
When he walks he waddles, and he ain't never lost a squabble
He put you in the locker, and took your girlfriend to prom
He's in your life every day, and you can't wait 'til he's gone
But daddy owns a business, so it won't be long
Before he inherits it, makes carats, and sings a rich man's song
He's got the most expensive clothes and jewelry to wear
While you're looking for a job, he's looking in the mirror
He walks the halls surrounded by his fan club
Starts fads, ends trends, and hits the ceiling when he stands up
He's a preppy, fame-hoggin', pig-headed fool
When he has a party, everyone's invited except you
And your crew. And there really ain't nothin' y'all can do
He's in every state, city, and town, as long as they got a school

[Hook]
He's a big shot. Thick knot in his wallet
Parents got enough money to send your whole family to college
He's a big shot. Testosterone thirsty
Hallway father figure with his masculinity stained on his jersey
He's a big shot. IB class whiz-kid
Braggin' about a big dick, that chick and this chick
He's a big shot...

[Verse 3]
My favorites are rappers, the egoistical bastards
The people that never clap for your set, they think you're whacker
Than them cause they're the masters
I bet disaster is caused in their mind when you rhyme
And plaster their jaws shut with a fat verse
To him you're a hazard. Weak matter. A reason for laughter
He's preachin' he's live. But he's only that word backwards
After he dies, you can climb the ladder, start a chapter
Art you'll capture finally
But while he breathes, m.c.'s don't even flatter him
Add a tad if his acrobatically arrogance
To his genetically engineered emotional pattern of tearin' kids in battles
That'll explain why he mean mugs. He told ya' your team sucks
Said you was a cream puff and fled
Now you dream of choking him with that mic cord
Instead, he blows your mind straight out your head
With that hardcore, tear emcees and send them to therapy
He says, "Fuck You!" with clarity. You cry hysterically
As he makes a parody of your passion
You tell friends you think he's tight
But secretly, you hope his career won't be lasting
Cause he's an asshole. But you know he's got nice sound
You know what else? You're looking at him right now

[Hook]
I'm a big shot. Don't front, you know you love me
Girls never wash their hands after they get a chance to touch me
I'm a big shot. Hey, you can say I'm a creep
But put me in a room with your idols and I'll make 'em look weak
I'm a big shot. Shit, can nobody fade me
The only way we can do a song is if somebody pays me
I'm a big shot. Big Shot. Big Props
The best thing to ever happen in the history of hip hopHe lives in a four by two glass box that reminds me of my head
I wish my floor would have rocks, but it's covered with puddles instead
If I could be him, life would be great
I could erase this permanent frown
I wouldn't even be held down by my own weight
I woke up walked to the tank to hear his thoughts on yesterday
How was it? I asked And after a tap on the glass
He looked my way then gave me this depressed expression
Impressed its best just to say
Besides the tides and the grey skies, it was ok!
And I said Hey mister fish, you did all that you wish
You got nothing to complain about while hanging out in this abyss
Well he replied "Well existence is bliss, there's so much that you miss
Besides get off the trip, happiness is just a myth"
I said "Living in water is extremely more peaceful than life confined to a mind
Blinded by evil, and forced to see through these two peep holes
It seems I've redeemed freedom, not being limited by walls
That only mean I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only mean I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only mean I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls
That only mean I qualify as ground for the sky when it falls'
But Mr. Fish just laughed as I went on and on and on
So I interrupted his chuckle, putting up a middle finger
And he boldly told me it's too bad I'm was such a thinker
So Arrogantly I asked "How could someone think too much?"
He added that insanity lingers and thoughts brought me to the brink of such
He said "You live inside a head that reminds me of my glass box"
And everyone's the same; all brains are contained by your reality frame
And chained to the terrain, it's trained hard not to change
And once you see what I've explained you hit the jackpot"
And at that very moment it was like my eyes really opened
The air that previously surrounded me was now an ocean
Still totally invisible except for minor pieces of debris
Then Mr. Fish pushed up to the glass and he looked just like me
My whole world spun around, I didn't understand
But I realised I was no longer a man
So I thought about what he said and asked him what was going on
And he said, "You didn't know it but you where the fish all along"
He said, "Congratulations, you did it, you broke free
You're just a fish, like the rest of humanity"
Now it took me a long time to get adjusted to this tank
But now I know what I am, and so to that man I give thanks
I've always lived inside this glass box that reminds him of his head
It just goes to show ya that your mind is your own monster
Reality is what you make it, if you take it away
You're just a fish, like me, swimming in the powdered water[Verse 1]
What's your definition of dope?
Cause I think our opinions differ
'Till your own skills develop, be wise and shut the hell up
I told you man, I'll fold your plans
You know you can't be colder than me
With a microphone in hand I'll show your fans I own this land
My flow's intangible
Expanding growth that stands and holds hip-hop on a cross
Lickin' shots for the lost vision
Listen: It's imbedded in my genetic code to push the evolution
Clean up the pollution and let the rhetoric grow
So your records get sold and with each blow
You give, adds tad more gold to eat whole out of your cracked peach bowl
As we go without rules, the freedom of independence we breed
So we'll eat 'till we're full, keep control and bleed at slow-mo speed, you know?
I weave and sew my way through this imaginary land of fairies and trolls
Tryin' to bury the scroll
I carry a load that weighs way more than my area code
Vocabulary unfolds so that you cherish the very story of merit you're told
Your character's bold, but build a barrier
Spare your words before you perish
Don't be careless, apparently to share a paragraph tears your nerves
Heard you grew some nuts
Now you think your crew don't suck?
Stupid fucks
In a battle you'll still lose to us

[Hook]
This one's for all the people in the world that think they can get with this
Eyedea and Abilities, you know we be the sickest
MCs under my feet with they names on my shit list
This one's for you, this one's for you
This one's for all my people lovin' hip-hop that are truly gifted
Eyedea and Abilities, we only came to rip shit
DJs with no cuts outside their self-inflicted wrist slits
This one's for you, this one's for you

[Verse 2]
What's your definition of dope?
Cause I think our opinions differ
I guess I don't know what's dope from the viewpoint of a listener
So how's it sound?
My new joints prove points
Arousing styles of new nose for a thousand miles in any direction you point
If I was your pal, I'd respect all criticism that was honest
But I'm not cause you're probably an MC in the closet
Subconsciously copyin' everything from the sentences to the penmanship
Mad cause I invented what you can't even pretend to intend to accomplish
Promise an end to this infinitely childish game
Refrain from grabbing the mic and spare yourself some shame
No, I don't sound the same
And yes, I'm a little deranged
But it ain't no thang cause lyrically, nobody can hang
There's always room for admiring a pro
But get off the jock
Can't you see the tire swing is full?
Oh, now you wanna call me out for offending your ears?
Just chill, there's a billion other better ways to end your career, for real
I can't even hear you skill-less motor mouths with total clout
Adding up to less than zero, I'm your hero
Don't go that route, I'll show you out now
Peace to all the real MCs
But first, I'mma show you show why my DJ's name is Abilities

[Hook][Verse 1]
She thinks sex might blur the lines
I’d be goofing at her clothes
She’d smear ‘em to death fly paradise and calls a castle home
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her- cold can rescue, broken blood vessel crush

She thinks her doctor's Jesus Christ
She must not like my song
She paints a side and picks a fight
Like's to show there's better cold
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her- cold can rescue, broken blood vessel crush

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She thinks sex might blur the lines
She’d rather bleed than blow
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her own
Come on her- cold can rescue, broken blood vessel crushEveryone knew she was a special young girl
From her neighbors to her teachers
Some labeled her a prodigy, others called her a genius
It was amazing the way she could play the violin
It made it hard for people to believe that she only ten
But behind every brilliant mind there lies a monster
This one just so happened to be her father
See daddy was sick, he'd get a rush by playin touchy touch
And tellin her to keep it hush
It was his seceret way of loving that he needed someone he could trust
Fucked her head up, sayin if Momma was alive she'd be so proud of us
So she'd hide the desire to die
But if you paid close attention you could see the sorrow in her eyes
Walking around in the only real hell
No one would ever think she'd have such a story to tell
Afraid to go home, afraid to talk, afraid of cryin
She was too young to even know why

[Hook]
And everyday she'd go to the river with a message in a bottle sayin
Please, God help me I don't wanna live to see tomorrow
Each day she'd scrounge for a tiny shread of hope
Just to wish the bottle would stay afloat
But every single solitary day, the bottle seems to sink
I don't know why but the bottle always sinks
She never sees it happen, but the bottle always sinks
Now only the bottom of the river knows what she really thinks

[Verse 2]
She made that violin sing with so much pain
You could almost hear her scream through the strange vibrations
What was once sweet and innocent
Is now riding with the phsychotic father
Chose to probe the flowers of the pure and sacred
Her instrument was a rolly tongue
To express the infinite abuse in its depths
At night the footsteps crept to her door and she'd begin to shake and weep
And with tears rolling down her cheeks, she's pretend she was asleep
When the nightmare was over, and the sun dawn is light
She'd retreat to the same place she always did
Rip a page from her diary, and write with all her might
Then send it off into the current, determined to find a way to live

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Being a victim of her daddy's hands for so long
She lost the will to move on
Sick of picking up her violin to hide from what's wrong
Exausted, but staying strong
She tried to play the bright side, but couldn't bring herself to make
Nothing but sad songs
Sick of that sick feeling that stays in her stomach
Sick of waiting for a rescue by someone who found one of her bottles
Sick of being daddy's little seceret
She got up at the crack of day and smashed her violin into pieces
Then proceeded to walk towards the river with a plan
Only this time the diary and bottle was in her hand
Just walk with herself, away from the hell
Not knowing at the river bottom lying in all the cries for help
It was weeks before they found her dead body
Some fisherman reeled it from the water
Like something from a detective novel
Diagonosis: suicide, stemed from desperation
Was near where she drowned they found about 500 messages in sunken bottles[Verse 1 : Eyedea]
Well about twenty, or thirty minutes ago
I was elected by someone to know
They told me "Man, you gotta keep the volume low, 'cos if not the cops'll come by and shut down the show"
So I said "All right, we'll keep the volume low"
But that's not the only reason why we wanna keep the volume low, you know
Sometimes you like to just wanna cool out and feel the flow, and feel like you can glow -
Even if you don't really know

[Kristoff Krane]
Yeah sometimes I really like to lay low
Sometimes you like to lay low inside of my halo by the rainbow
All these little demons that come and try to strangle me but I won't -
'Cos I'll leave them tangled and angled up in a _
A robot tug of war with my own beliefs and I don't know what's going on I hold my sword and I cut the grease right right through the sky
Fly and open it and sit inside of it and tell myself a lie is my only protection

[Verse 3 : Mazta I]
Yeah rap boy, rap boy, turn that shit down
You're not deaf the police in the town don't wanna hear that sound of that real hip-hop
Forced I open drip drop, instead I make you wanna wear sandal flip flops
Go to the beach 'cos, life is a bitch
Represent on track like Tango Switch[?]
Or derail never fell, you can tell how we inhale
Got Heaven on my mind when I sign without the rebel in mind
Ayo most of 'em blind
Most of 'em don't got the real shit that I've got in my mind
So I speak to the ones that, can't be late
And, all of us that eat - break bread and get a plate
Hey, can I get some food, I get rude
Regulations get broke, like my name not mentioned in the constitution
Feel my shocker when I electrocute them
I represent just like the real generals and I salute them
Off the topper, never dropping, never stopping, there's no option
Like a rare octagon, I'm the head-doctor man
Represent this shit just like Breakfast Ramadan.
If they ain't ready then fuck it, I'm a conscious one
I'm conscious enough for the subconscious and tap[?] did it
Represent this shit just like the rats get capped in it
Head snapped in it, yo
The odds of the master, fly for the faster
Represent like green for the past -
Vegetarian, I eat some fish but no scavenger on my dish but I wish
Ayo, I didn't even have to eat food
Shit, I could just break you down in compounds and eat you[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Teeth marks on the skin
The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing me that I was him
We like to feel the blood and fat dripping off our gums
She likes to talk directly down the barrel of her gun
Learning to perfect the ancient art of quiet rape
You've always been so warm and calculated, I owe you a thanks
Eyes wide shut, I promise not to fall awake
Lick the guillotine and tell you how the gasoline tastes
The grass is always greener on the other pesticide
Solemn precious crept through the mess to shed it's infectious high
What's for me to know and you to find
Guilty, the almighty praised adrenaline
Such an underwhelming thrill
Where there's a will there's a wake
Burn me at the stake
Who the hell am I trying to fool?
I'm a fool, I feel so fake
One last goodbye before I take my .45
Shoot a hole in the sky, rip it open
And climb inside

[Hook: Eyedea]
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me
Empathy is the poor man's cocaine
And love is just a chemical by any other name
I like the way your pheromones make me sleepy
This far away I still smell you inside me

[Bridge]
Tie me down till my sweet nothing's sour
I screwed up trying to squeeze 65 minutes from an hour
Outnumbered by such a large amount
No wonder why we lost the battle, the counter-culture can't count

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Welcome to my private hell
There's no one to fight now, enjoy myself
I'd rather drown than ask for help
I wish I was someone else
Mr. Perfect, Misconstrued
Lead the way, follow through
You probably hate me, I do too
You're so much like me I feel sorry for you
But I think you're pretty, pretty sure
You will profit, you will get hurt
I eat my words they taste like dirt
I'm only ashamed because I know what it's worth
Find my comfort inside blame
Shove my pride back down my face
My worst habit's waking up at least once a day
Balance barefoot on a needle heaven's just a jump away

[Hook][Verse 1: Eyedea]
Oh how easily they forget no anchor to the past
Cut the blood supply and hope the heart beats itself to death
My ribcage is now my own it still feels like your arms neck clothed in salt
How'd I let it go this far?
It happens faster than you could ever think
From always and forever to never again in less than a blink
The river runs until it's dry
But I die spitting my last drip into it's mouth to keep it alive
Long drives, wide eyes, and your smiling face
You dance I drink, let's waste the night away
They say you always know right away
But you can't foresee your sand being pulled into the sea under a tidal wave
Secrets leak out when you're asleep
Coming from a queen's mouth, talk isn't all that cheap
I'm now a lone flame searching for a purpose
Setting fires everywhere I go, can't avoid the burns
We shared pain
You took me by the throat and made me understand the world as if I were you and I couldn't breathe
Now you can lead a horse to fresh water but you can't teach it how to be okay when you decide to leave
I'm lost, there's no one to protect
I got so used to being shelter from the rain that always followed you
It's not my first time, actually it's nothin new
But that doesn't make it any easier to get through
The snow won't melt, smoke won't clear
Turned hope inside out a thousand times trying to see if it was ever anything more than dressed up fear
But the two go hand in hand you can't have one without the other being there
I'm barely breathing waiting for the spins to end
Begging a god I don't believe in to let me sleep so I can dream again
We went through thick and thin
Came out separate on the other end
But please know no matter what you'll always have me as a friend
And I finally know
Your crime is your pride and your past is my only ghost
I'm going crazy out of my control
But there's nothing I can do, I have no choice but to let it go
Each day gets a little less intense
I no longer feel like there's someone standing on my chest
You made me more me, and I won't forget the times you helped my find my feet
When I was buried in my head
Thank you, for giving what you had to give
Taking what you had to take
And making me believe in you
Even though I might be gone forever there will always be a place in my brain that will think of you
You look so graceful when you're flying
Keep going, there's a lot of world that you haven't seen
You have my best wishes, even if only in silence, you deserve everything that you've ever dreamed
The snow melted right when the smoke cleared
I turned love inside out a thousand times trying to see if it was ever anything more than the will to persevere
But the two go hand in hand, the clouds surrounding you eventually will clear
I can breathe I found contentment in the end
Telling a god I don't believe in to go to sleep so I can think again
We went through thick and thin
Came out separate on the other end
But please know no matter what you'll always have me as a friend[Verse 1: Eyenine]
Stop listening to things that make you think about yourself
Drop everything that's been a hassle to your mental health
Watch carefully and then you'll see a bare and empty shelf
Carelessly you'll never see apparent calls for help
Well you believe so fluently that things can never change
And you stupidly refuse to see the errors in your ways
And I understand that this whole planet's thoroughly deranged
But that doesn't mean that you should so scared to break away
Well I wonder what's under the cover of darkness
Counting the number of innocent hardships
Making an effort to realize all this
Suffering has to be making some progress
Changing the way that I look at those places
Hating the way that you show me those faces
Breaking the balance of homeostasis
Taking my talents and calling them basic
I'll face it, well it's inevitable when it's set in the stone
When I'm sending my soul into hell and I know
That my rhetoric won't be direct in a poem
I'm faceless, this era hasn't made a name because it's tasteless
I'm sick of all these wasted cases and their makeshift habitats
I'll make sense out of rap and take this cataract
And make your vision out of whack
It's calling, I'm falling a little bit more every day when I'm stalling
I'm running from reapers that want to be hauling my body back to that old place that's appalling
Well I guess I know one thing about life
Everybody's ends in either death or suicide
And I'm just trying to figure out if what I do is right
So Eyedea, why don't you grab the mic and shed a little light?

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
Well the summer bleeds a foreshadow of what's to come and go to waste
It blankets me, braces me, something sweet that I can't taste
You're my mother, I'm your morphine, let's go make a baby out of two guitars
A heavy heart, I'll seem happy when you're looking smoking, singing, eating, fucking
One size fits angel coma, you're my favorite stranger
And I won't hate you till I know you
Somewhere between the garden and the grave
I bypassed the machine, I wouldn't have felt its effects anyway
Sentiment is the tramp that bored this special hollow
Cram it in my old cuts, it leaves a whole lot less to swallow
Exercise your right to never buy what you can borrow
Carve my sorrys in the sky and hope the sun hides them tomorrow
Manufactured disaster, it seems I've made my bed
No one sees the burn holes until the sleeper wakes up dead
Take my hands away, I'll pull the moon down with my wrists
Making plans to fake 'safe as possible' is dangerous

[Verse 3: Eyenine]
Writer's block just might have stopped this song from being finished
Cause my mind was stocked from rhymes I've dropped from previous conditions
So I listened to the words again, envisioned things I would have said
And crossed out many lines that didn't rhyme and left them all for dead
I was trapped inside my head and I couldn't get out my pen from my back pocket
Guess I lost it, so I wrote these words instead
If you would just shut up enough for me to get my point across
I'm sure this conflict could be solved without having substantial loss
And when I see the rain is coming overhead I stay and function
Back inside my mind I try to find the ways to make assumptions
Taking something that's been written, mixing it down with high precision
Making it sound all nice and vivid and match it up with my direction and vision
And eloquence, the decadence, the medicine, the precedence
The messages, the sentences, the evidence that I presented to win
The reason to fight, the weakest to bleed
The seasons of time passed between when I dream
The secret to life, the reason to be, It has all been shown to me

[Verse 4: Eyedea]
Well every once in a blue moon I read your mind
Heaven ended too soon and stole my pride and left me blind
Exercise my morning shakes pretended I was born this way
Wearing my Academy Award-winning performance face
Snake shedding skin, it's all in my head again
Life fetish led me to a dead end
I said when but no one was listening
Obviously cause they filled it to the brim and are spilling it all over me
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl in this hole with me
I'd fall on my face just to make sure that you notice me
Your cold shoulder's always so sobering
I'll be understood as long as I don't overthink
Walking on thin ice, talking in the form of song
Singing in the key of life, I'll lose my voice before too long
Head came loose and they screwed it back together wrong
Fire behind my eyes, desire died all night long[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Veins like a roadmap, black cold grasp on a throat that
Won’t hold back old habit, Kodak moments go past
I wrote stains on a toe-tag, old man made me so sad
That no taste of the Cognac or Prozac antidote, twist my skull
Off with his head, head like a hole Nine Inch Nails pressed to the bone
Exit alone, try and fail, I’ve inhaled dead to the world
Ethanol on your pedestal, churn chemical burns
Hurt worse than skeletal, so skeptical at first, perfect
Cursive in Hell, sweet silver bells all seem to say "Please go away”
Demons will play, eating away, new young and old, food for the soul-
Less that you know, the less that you feel
I'm cursed with intelligence I can't heal
Kneel, kill, death to the bourgeois, proletariat with the new song
Noose on a bony neck, loneliness, opiate and a bruised jaw
Allah’s not, nobody owns me, no job, robot, no cold feet
No God, only strong no home, no soul sold so-so so long

[Hook: Lotte Kestner]
Watch the paint peel
Slow as the burn you feel
Break the heart you never should've
You can bury anything
In the woods

[Verse 2: Eyedea]
I'm a live wire in a dead world, I'm a good boy, but I'm a better girl
Eyes closed, finger on the trigger, one inch different I'm free
You’re a widow, liquor liver, Suboxone under my tongue
Private numb, one more time for dying young
I had fun, watching father try to run, but he left a black hole inside his son
If we're being Frank, I'm an average Joe, cop shop
Jake and Johnny, Jack and Coke, your tsunami of only
Honestly couldn't even reach the back row
So how do you expect to drown me, dumbfound me or harm me
You and what army, are we clear, I'm here
In a rearview mirror, coming to a theater near you
To steer you away from your fears, stage bound
Usually it's break-a-leg, she told me to break a heart
I didn't know what to say exactly so I walked away
And later thought I should've at least told her thanks
But that's how that goes, where the grass grows
There’s a past in the time capsule, I'm attracted to its shadow
Every last drip 'til I'm flat broke
Let’s make this storm feel clean, coward man war machine
Sour plans, plots and schemes, ripened fruit, rotten dreams
Thoughtlessly, I told a lie, nothing I won't do to save my own behind
I'm a live wire burning dead inside
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead, I'm not dead until I've died

[Outro: Eyedea]
Yeah, cut your wrists on a blade of glass
I can't change my past but I can kiss the now and make it last
Take out the trash, crash, burn, another relapse
Turn rehashed meat perhaps
There's an in-between smile and frown behind your mask[Eyedea]
Listen player, I think you should sit this one out
We'll have a better game without you running your mouth

[Carnage]
I got a question. Any other MC's in the house?

[Eyedea]
If you rhyme raise your hand so I know who I'm kicking out

[Carnage]
Yo dude, I think you should sit this one out
We'll have a better game without you running your mouth

[Eyedea]
Yo, I got a question. Any other motherfuckers in the house?

[Carnage]
Man, if you rhyme raise your hand so I know who I'm taking out

[Verse 1: Eyedea]
Hold your damn horses Charlie
This game is ours
So what you a star?
That don't make you hard
I'll knack your neck out that ice you sportin'
I don't need your petty title I'll battle you for your vital organs
Autograph 'em with a mean streak and put 'em on Ebay
If they don't sell in three days then I put 'em out on the freeway
It's E-Y-Easy in da heezy fo' sheezy
For does that don't know we gon' show you how we play
So he can't rap, step up on the gas
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

[Verse 2: Carnage]
??? out of the cup with some chick
That I roll with my nigga a-e-d-e-y-e
So you know I must be dope
??sounds like he's saying "bot-tom wa-ter" or "buh-dum-wa-dah" as in an onomatopoeia??
Gay nights to a gay rights enslave fake dykes and gay types

To react at S K
See I need but really ask why
Double-S U P who may bite
Then race by? some play bytes?
I can approve the day slice?
We stay quite ??
Never mundane, differently arranged symphony
Brain quickly creates
Enough data that'll shatter matter at a

[Eyedea]
Great quakely shake to make shaky mindstates break and chain

[Carnage]
Vividly badder patterns ???
Castrate wack apes who claiming that

[Eyedea and Carnage]
We only playing for this game's victory

[Carnage]
Bitch, I think you should sit this one out
We'll have a better game without you running your mouth

[Eyedea]
I got a question. Any other MC's in the house?

[Carnage]
Man, if you rhyme reach your hand, so I know who I'm taking out

[Eyedea]
Listen player, I think you should sit this one out
We'll have a better game without you running your mouth

[Carnage]
Yo I got a question. Any other MC's in the house?
If you rhyme raise your hand so I know who I'm taking out

[Verse 3: Eyedea]
You're under my jurisdiction
Where the purest vision: every lyricist winds missing
Wishin' he carried a pistol
It's such a risky tourist visit
Is it a moral issue
If he came to my home claiming to own
The right to show his might
Hold a microphone and recite that bullshit poem
You ask me he shoulda known we clown clones
And take crowns from fake foes who oppose the throne
With a pen and pad I'm bad to the bone
And even better off the dome if you get me pissed and push me into that zone
You must have had the Jones to get your head thrown
Get slapped ??? Pakistan?
To sit back home with your wack songs
Either right or wrong
???
In styrofoam
I drill a hole inside your skull and steal your soul, your particles and anything else valuable
Cause you're and intellectual coward and I'm an infallible international professional ???
Scholar an attitude and I don't approve of you

[Verse 4: Carnage]
Destroy you who seek ?? through weak ploy to doubt us
Like we're just part of some novices to the culture b-boy crew
With ??? because we was ??? signing bitch mc's ??? blood attach a razorblade
Had the nerves to dare ???
???
Your lacking a rhythm
Some are ??? with the proper techniques to hit you ??? til it resembled that of a ??? motorcycle accident victim
Doodoo dirty
Who you hurt, me?
You booboo worthy
An immediate cremation, no casket
And your mother; nothing but a gentle waving
Courtesy of Carnage wearing a soaked in your haemoglobin FUBU jersey
???
And for having your whack ass
???
? write a song called
"Fuck Eric B, DJ Abilities is president"
Sucker, I think you should sit this one out
We'd have a better game without your running your mouth

[Outro]
Ayo Carnage man, you be bugging man

[Carnage]
Yo I'm sure these losers got the point, why don't we just be out?

[Eyedea]
Aiiiight

[Carnage]
PEACEI once met a man who trained himself not to dream
What he seems to have seen was a glimpse of everything
He's been painting pictures on canvas since age thirteen
And claims he only exists in the mind of a higher being
And I enjoy his work; mostly scenic landscapes
But each one is focused on an easel where the man paints himself painting himself
And all that's in his visual field
He said this was the only way he could make himself real
Ever since he could remember, he had one nightmare reoccur
But until about ten years ago, it didn't matter
It consisted of loud, distorted sounds echoing off the concrete
He ran on top of it in attempt to reach a ladder
Now sometimes, he'd get so close but never touch his destination
Which caused him much frustration cause he didn't know what it meant
And by the end of the dream, he saw the scene from a bird's eye
Only to witness his dead body laying on the cement

It was only to witness his dead body laying on the cement
At first it freaked him out, but after a while he grew content
So he thought, "It's just a dream," and kept living his life
Writing his soul on the canvas cause it sheds his planet light
And it goes on and on like space and time, ain't nothing odd
It's not that he didn't believe, he just didn't approve of God
His experience was one I couldn't comprehend
'Till I stopped being detective and listened to him as a friend
He said

[Hook]
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
It was then that he knew he was the art of divinity
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
A brush stroke of the gods made him one note in their symphony
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
He spoke for himself and not the rest of humanity
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
And I realize that I'm not real
God just imagined me

It's like I said
About ten years ago, the event that changed his whole reality
Took place on his monthly trip to the local art gallery
It was there where he studied his contemporaries
And there where he nearly carried his sanity to a hole and buried it forever
It was a very mysterious day
The place was almost empty
And he got chills down his spine just being present in the scene
On the wall, there was a picture that looked familiar
And when he got close, his heart stopped
Cause he saw it was a painting of his dream
It was a painting of his dream
His body on a runway
By a ladder to an airplane with its propellers spinning
Which accounted for the loud noise
The match up was perfect
And that was the day he stopped believing in existing
He resented his creator
I mean, words can't explain
What must have went on in his brain while he stared into a frame
Of a work of art which he created and was at the same time
The mind can't handle that much, it's just insane
It's like reading a book where each words describe your thoughts
And in quotations, it reads whatever you say when you talk
You think it can't happen
But it did happen
I guess there's surprisingly wide cracks in each life's sidewalk
He stumbled upon an answer when he never had a question
And decided to stop dreaming to maintain his mental health
Now he hardly talks to people
Just stays in his basement
Writing infinity, by painting himself
Painting himself
This is a strange universe
Is it all just a blueprint?
In the real universe, is my consciousness useless?
Are we really something a higher intelligence made up?
A figment of imagination colored by a cosmic paintbrush?
Maybe all of our art creates the fate of other beings
Then every character in ever novel thinks it's alive and were just gods
Ruling blindly
Just a theory
I don't know what it means
But that's the story of the man who trained himself not to dream

[Hook]
He once saw a paining that told his whole life story
He witnessed the paradox of the word "existing"
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
He colored his world theirs, and concluded he wasn't living
He once saw a painting that told his whole life story
The hidden variable that all that is is art
And when I close my eyes, I see eternity as a story
A God imagined the God that imagined me
And I am God
And so on[Eyedea]

I've robbed myself on the ability to see the mountain by focusing on the mole hill you made and telling you all about it
Now you tip-toe around, careful not to awaken the problem
As long as it's asleep you call it solved
All flaws forgotten

Step within a mile
You can smell the self-loathe
Death of an only sundial
Made touch and hell helpful meltdown, burn up
Side-to-side, ache
Lovers know each other
How'd it feel when you imagined my face?
I hurt
Strangled by the money dirty bloody taste
You hurt
But we live to fight and fuck another day

Shut your eyes butterfly and trust the skies
I had enough of my shit too
Your flight plan is justified

I'm not sure I feel as awful as I act
But Romeo never got his way by faking a laugh
I'm making this puzzle one war at a time
Yours truly
My only and beloved falsely mine
