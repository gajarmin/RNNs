[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang[Intro: Hodgy]
I fucked this flow

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
This is my electronic press kit, I hot as some fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your courtesy
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitches shit in my drawers like you piss in my drawers
Nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drums for when the champ come, bitch

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creeping in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowling, hunger at its fucking best
I'm a beast like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse our swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
The fortress is fortified (bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recording live
Bitch I be surely high and I don't need wings to fly
I'm the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Knock-knock, who's there? It's me
Your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar)
Nigga don't believe me, kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebie jeebies?
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
(5 albums, 100 songs, and you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
I bet you got some J-Kwon, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?)
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, "Where my dick go?"
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her whole
Enchilada, I gotta lotta that 'Preme and I'm paying nada
It seems that I'm product placement but I'm not I'm just fuckin' awesome
Yo mama look like a ugly (Fuck you) loser[Verse 1]
Bitches think I'm crazy but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performing
That's an act so I won't bore you to death
Cause I adore you.. and it's the summer so

[Hook]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

[Verse 2]
You can bring your bitches, I'mma bring my niggars
You can practice liking I, I'mma practice that guitar, baby
It's summer camp Golf Wang where the talking trees are
You and girls can roll if you

[Hook]

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If you meet me by the pier, bring the peer, we can menage
Ooh, your girl friend Nicki gots the back I like to massage
I'll be in the city with them actresses
The Nissan is down there in the bottom of the lake
I'll make sure you have a good time, a good time
I'll make sure it’s a good time, a good time for you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Love sick, where’s the clinic aid we’re young
Fun is what we’re having, fuck it, pour a glass of lemonade
It’s snowcone and poptarts I got and I got you
Let me take a dip and you can take a break
That’s only if you meet me by the lake

[Outro]
Could you meet me by the lake around ten?

*Silence*

[Intro: Syd tha Kyd]
Meet me at the lake round ten (Come through)
Meet me at the lake round ten (It's cool, wanna kick it)

[Hook]
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handle bars

[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
Kissing under moonlight
I can bring you to our tree house
We'll be fucking on the rooftop
If you're not down, we can just make out

[Hook][Verse 1: Jasper]
Chillin' in class with a bag full of grass
Lookin' for a white chick to smoke up and choke up
I even got that white sniff come over here and take a whiff
Now you ready to get raped and ate by Mr. Haley
Litter Life is the gang, it's that shit that we bang
Let's play an Odd game, it's called bitch you better run
When those Odd Wolves come out
And chew you up bitch like bubble gum
Jasper's off climbin' trees with that nazist you see
Never met a nigga like me because I'm an Oddsby
Opposite of them Cosby kids
Got that Virginia Tech swag, shoot up your school and laugh, bitch

[Hook]
Swag me out bitch
Wolf Gang!

[Verse 2: Left Brain]
Uh, Left Brain, Wolf Gang
Swag, me, the fuck, out
'fore you get punched in your fuckin' mouth
I'mma take your bitch back to my crib
You already know my dick is gon' be in ribs
Yeah, and I like barbecue
Fuckin' with me, I'm fuckin' with you
Uh, Wolf Gang, that's the fuckin' clique
If you got a problem bitch hop on this dick
Nigga I don't want you here
So get the fuck out 'fore shoot you like a deer
Swag me out, swag me out
I don't give a fuck, swag me out
Oh oh, where the fuckin' hoes?
Hoes hoes, where the fuckin' hoes?
Hoes hoes, where the fuckin' hoes?
Where the hoes?

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
You faggots yap about tokin' kush
While I deal with drug dealers and they killed a whole bush
George inside the storage if you wanna take a look
But keep your motherfuckin' daughter's mouth shushed boy
Lookin' for them white sluts who good at suckin' cat
Wolf dick black as nigga riders from the fat black bitches
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All don't give a fuck
Loiter Squad, you know where the fuck we at
Earl and Berman swervin' in the Jeep
Me and Travis in the back squirtin' Jergins on her feet
What is that? Not a penis
What the fuck is extra meat? I don't know, ask Asia
Two nazi dykes shittin' in a Synagogue
Cause that bitch lick balls from Western to Crenshaw
And her grandma suck dick down in Rimpau
And she masturbates with Vaseline and a Ken doll

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Hodgy Beats]
We cool like the breeze at the fuckin' beach
They told me to write a flow, I wrote a fuckin' speech
Odd Future Wolf Gang rolls fuckin' deep
Taylor Swift come around, we go fuckin' deep
She's our slut for weeks and she wash our sheets
Brush our teeth but don't make our beats
Tyler got the waffles, Devon covers bacon
2DopeBoyz got the beef, we serve filet mignon shakin'
Sour D's got me touchin' the moon
Rollin' up blunts the size of a fuckin' cocoon
Wolves roll together like some family raccoons
Tellin' you to eat an ass like a fuckin' baboon

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Earl Sweatshirt]
Swag me out, swag me out, Jasper get them faggots out
Snortin' coke, got the Pope yellin' who let the rabbits out
Kissin' whores and kissin' bunnies, put this horse dick in your tummy
I am on this track because that nigga Taco isn't funny

[Verse 6: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Jesus in the Humvee, Ace and Mary gettin' comfy
Jeffrey Dahmer's in the bushes with R. Kelly tryna fuck me
Steve Harvey, Kenan Thompson's plottin' how to jump me
Well fuck Steve Harvey and fuck that vase

[Verse 7: Jack Mushroom]
Fucking Waterham
Hodgy's ass eat skills help eat all the Jam
Damn I'm like marmalam, marmalade

[Verse 8: Mike G]
Yo motherfuck 'em if they haters, bet I'll rain on their parade
I'm that ignorant motherfucker who took your daughter on a date
Dare her to answer the phone if you call her cause she's late
Black kid on the corner sellin' drugs go figure
Syd tha Kyd, what the fuck we doin'? (Flippin' bricks nigga!)

[Verse 9: Taco]
Fuck you listening to this Wolf Gang reserve
Driving with your bitch swagged Jasper
Don't give a fuck stealing your fucking purse
All I do is live verse, yeah nigga
Swag me the fuck out, Loiter Squad Bacon Boys
Nigga we take your girl, rape her in the back
Of the fucking Jeep, with Rob squirting her feet
With Jurgens nigga, Ultra Healing

[Verse 10: Jasper]
Yeah we're swerving in the Jeep, while I'm rolling up the tree
Litter Life don't give a fuck, that's why we fucking up the trees
Wolf bandit and land it you niggas can't stand it
Chop a bitches head off and get a pleasant nut off, bitch

[Hook][Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Carter Wong, bring the challenge from the eight masters
Hodgy Long one of them bastards that would head bash ya
Yeah, we Skate Mental, but the meaning of a Thrasher
Is to whiplash out and leave you pussy niggas fractured
I need meds from a mental institution
'fore my brain is revenged, free throw finger shootin'
Record them screamin, interwine them in a loop, then
Take the garbage out back, I pay the homage in fact
I'm throwing T-Bones to these wannabe me clones
And their wannabe me clothes, bitch I'm actually old
I spin ya like the cover we on, you're in between the pages
I'm 21 now been running these Fairfax blocks for ages
Organic for breakfast, free-ranging on stages
It's twelve-noon on my clock, engaged for 12 Gauges
I spit the plague, and don't believe it be a pagan
I'll send your wife dead photos of you taken by Sagan, bitch

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
This that we shit hot shit, piss off custodians
Get rich and marry fat﻿ bitch Lamar Odiom
I’m rich bitch, and y'all's jelly as that jar of petroleum
That I had used when I eloped with him and 40 Mormons and
I'm planning on firing Clancy, ain't no damn controlling him, boy
You can't carry this, them Cannon Nickelodeon boy
My boy Domo higher than fat bitches sodium
And nuggets greener than the fucking can my Arizona's in
I'm sneaking in your kid's ear lobe "Oh, no! It's him! Goblin!"
Dropped like the soap in the tub
Now I have have famous friends who like coke and they're drugged
Dancing with me, Jerry Sandusky, and the Pope in the club
Jerry's trying to get a tug but it isn't paying enough
Now if he doubles it I'll tug it in the bathtub with bubbles
And a rubber ducky that I got on tour Kentucky with some groupies
Where I had got lucky with some sucky-sucky trust me honey bunny
If you fuck me you gonna leave with runny nose
I be running in these hoes ain't no condom on, fucking fuck, me[Intro: Hodgy Beats]
Oh shit, yea, shut up bitch
Bitch, bitch shut up
The fuck up, the fuck you talkin', shut the fuck up
Bitch

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
If I was a dinosaur I would be a flexasaurus
Since you don't like what the fuck you heard, fast forward to the chorus
Hodgy Beats, Odd Future, Golf Wang nigga, but there's more of us
Coroner's out when they're killing the gorgeous
Diamond cut like what the fuck is flawless?
Tell the runner to go and get me some go
Cause I'm bubblin' on you horrors
I'm such a mystery
Mystery is more quiet than a hipster Prius takin' a trip to Egypt
Niggas claim to be scenic when I know they ain't seen shit
I see shit fuckin' seasick, rain showers is what I predict
My flow is like gymnastics, so
Beef flips, patty cakes, smoke a pound of dro for the algae taste
Say what up to my pinky, say hi to my index
Fuck all the hoes want middle finger, thumb take shots like a pentax
Bitch I kill 'em all, you could just write off they death tax
Boxin' niggas out of the mic, punch lines, death match

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I invented swag, fuck what these other niggas talkin' 'bout
Niggas wanna brag 'bout the shit that they lack
But the truth of the fact, it's all word of mouth
Talk a lot of crap, but ain't shit for sure
Bathin' Ape shit that I get for low
I don't pay much and I don't say much
But I still got a swag you should get to know
I flip a show, spend it on apparel
Spanish bitch tell me I look mucho dinero
Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yea
Doper than the 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps
Sorry bitch, I'm paper, chase
When I get where I am, I want my demands
With my nuts in my hand, like fuck you pay me

[Outro: L-Boy]
Yeah! Balls in my hands!
Monster cock! Odd Future Wolf Gang!
Kill Them All! Yeaaaaah[L-Boy]
Let me tell y'all niggas a little motherfuckin' story real quick. Once upon a time, there was this group of dusty ass motherfuckers create a little group for themselves. They call themselves Odd Future. The motherfuckers made a motherfucking tape, Odd Future Tape Volume 2. You know, that ugly ass nigga Tyler with his bitch ass. I should fuck that nigga up when I see him. Nappy ass hair. Left Brain, that nigga ugly as fuck, big ass nose. Syd gay ass, puttin' her clit on other bitches nipples and shit whatnot. Matt big ass, big ass nigga with some small ass earrings, bald. Mike G, crusty ass. My nigga Earl ugly as fuck, let's have a moment of silence for that nigga real quick. Fuck silence, fuck that. My nigga Jasper, dirty fatass, that nigga boxers stink. My nigga Frank. Fuck, fuck Frank, nigga, fuck him. Taco, ohhh, young bitch ass, I should, I, fuck, I hate all these niggas. And you know, that little short gay light-skinned nigga Hodgy and that fatass nigga Domo. Let me just...[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I'm a lotta narcotics, flow aquatic atomic
The way I rhyme in Islamic promises, ignorance is common sense
Straining my glottis, fucking hungry hippopotamus
You niggas are in the bottom pit, obnoxiousness
Is what I was raised around as a child
I'd rather chuck up my middle finger than give a bitch a smile
Hostility fertile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler?

[Interlude]
Uh, you hear that shit?
Ay, run that shit back
Yeah, that shit hot, nigga

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Hostility fertile like my mule and 40 acres
In my Stacy Adam gators, where's that mothafuckin' stapler?
Good grades on the wall, niggas hate to see me do it major
I’m just a leader of my team and I ain’t afraid to trade ya
Lacing my shoes, we the MellowHype jews
We controlling the crews, drinking Belgium booze
We animals out the zoos, with a fuse abused
Bitches brewing in our stews, on they knees like the pews

[Hook x2]
Sock a buster in his jaw
Fuck the police, break the law
Twist your fingers up, grip your balls
If you ain't got heart you ain't got shit at all

[Bridge x2]
Where your homies at? They'll get fucked up too
Where your grandma at? She'll get fucked up too
Where your bitch at? She'll get fucked up too
Where the roof at? We'll stomp that bitch through

[Interlude]
Here we go negero, I sing figaro, figaro
Chunking up my deuce bigalow, burning bodies in infernos

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
Aww, mothafucka wanna see you shine and I got my gold on
Clancy said I'm late for my flight, well they better hold on
Can't wait 'til I fuckin' buy me a jet, there gon' be some hoes on it
Just blow O's on it, count dough on it
Smoking in the sky, damage the ozone, don't it?
Shit, I'll take a life for my moment's moment
Contract your own sale, fuck a deal, you're in auction
Turn the bass up, give mothafuckas concussions
Rappers nowadays are all phased when it comes to soft shove
If niggas saying your flow weak, you shoulda bought one
You call this brand new, to me it's Santa Cruz
Don't find HB the man to lose, you ain't a bruise
Catch me on MTV or your local channel news
In London recording to Muse, I'm the man at the fuse
I'm fucking crazy, need slavery to behave me
Engraving what I am saying into your mothafuckin' brain and skull

[Hook x2][Verse 1]
Bitches think I'm crazy but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performing
That's an act so I won't bore you to death
Cause I adore you.. and it's the summer so

[Hook]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, or in your room?

I can bring you to our tree house
We'll be fucking on the rooftop
If you're not down, we can just make out

[Hook][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Bitch
It's the five-nine taper fade; Sideline Laker game
High time save a page; They already know the name
Doms in this bitch I mean it's real shit taking place
Money still the motive and I'm clocking it like Flava Flav

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Let me take my scarf off five-four-three-two-one bitch
Hodgy bout to barf logs, I be spitting fire campin makin s'mores
My flow be tramping like you whores I'm suicidal fuck the door
I'm and if but and or

[Verse 3: Domo]
Bitch what the fuck is you talking bout if you ain't getting no money huh
Broke niggas is talking loud I swear you niggas is funny bruh
We what the fuck is up 2012 clutch as fuck
Fast lifestyle nigga slow me down double cup

[Verse 4: Hodgy]
Old school visans rhyme ambidextrous
I switch hands five o clock when your bitch lands by six
She will be quicksand better than the next nigga: this man
Pockets swell up like a sick gland killing your whole ambition
Bitch

[Verse 5: Domo]
My hat says high cause that's exactly how I feel bitch
All I need is green grass and gold on my real bitch
Watch me get it nigga I'mma sell it real quick
Hodgy drew the master plan and Domo hit the kill switch

[Verse 6: Hodgy]
I'm young fellow guy peddle by reppin MellowHigh
Girlfriend never settles why? To busy in the meadows high
Out to Dena I'm fresh like I'm out the cleaners
Hardwood like an angry beaver I'm nuts like my fucking t-shirt
Get it?

[Verse 7: Domo]
A phantom you never hand a random rapper eating cannibal
She can't refuse so I let her drink it like it's Danimals
Handsome dude she wanna be with standing by camera crews
I let her snooze and dream cause none of them wishes tangible

[Verse 8: Hodgy]
I'm balling like Benjamin it's all about the Benjamins
That's why people acknowledge me and I ain't even friends with them
Call a ho then stall a ho I'm also dope across the rope
Catch my fade I bang grenades and beat your face 'til it's off your throat

[Verse 9: Domo]
Please shut the fuck up let me put this shit to sleep
The shit he speak got him all antsy like his Christmas week
Silly me, riding with several bitches with slim physiques
And I'm tryna see lights cameras action like Mr. Cheeks

[Verse 10: Hodgy]
Army fatigue Bape boxes for the league
No ghetto barrettes and weaves down to the sleeve for the fees
If packaged she'll be petite know how to roll up my weed
Her doing's doing the deed and she don't really need shit

[Verse 11: Domo]
They asking Domo "where you been?" They feel they got ditched
Just look for the influence I be under that bitch and
It's a headlock when it come to that grip
You ain't never met a motherfucker done in that sick

[Verse 12: Hodgy]
I'm the best thing yet the I'm the best thing next
I bet I'll mess with presets and jet around all these vets
That don't know how to let go; this game is filled with a bunch of grey hair dead souls
Promise 90 retro, ho

[Verse 13: Domo]
Hey y'all get out of he way cause I'm going AWOL
Bitch lay off the gas that they giving your head tank dog
Thinking that you better than me will get you taked off
You either gotta win or go home, bitch it's the playoffs

[Verse 14: Hodgy]
More luxurious that a throwback with no low Jack no driver but it got doormats
Zero to sixty in like 4 flat; you know any nigga that own that
I ain't stuntin' I'm a youngin' me and my niggas we be thuggin'
At our shows that we be bugging groupie loving and we buzzing

[Outro: Both]

[Domo]
So meet me in the trap; it's going down
MellowHigh leaning like the jaw of Bobby Brown

[Hodgy]
Cops arrest me for a DUI prohibition
We don't need you motherfuckers to stop and listen
Golf Wang Bitch[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]

Oh shit, yea, shut up bitch

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
If I was a dinosaur I would be a flexasaurus
Since you don't like what the fuck you heard, fast forward to the chorus
Hodgy Beats, Odd Future, Golf Wang nigga, but there's more of us
Coroner's out when they're killing the gorgeous
Diamond cut like what the fuck is flawless?
Tell the runner to go and get me some go
Cause I'm bubblin' on you horrors
I'm such a mystery
Mystery is more quiet than a hipster Prius takin' a trip to Egypt
Niggas claim to be scenic when I know they ain't seen shit
I see shit fuckin' seasick, rain showers is what I predict
My flow is like gymnastics, so
Beef flips, patty cakes, smoke a pound of dro for the algae taste
Say what up to my pinky, say hi to my index
Fuck all the hoes want middle finger, thumb take shots like a pentax
Bitch I kill 'em all, you could just write off they death tax
Boxin' niggas out of the mic, punch lines, death match

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I invented swag, fuck what these other niggas talkin' 'bout
Niggas wanna brag 'bout the shit that they lack
But the truth of the fact, it's all word of mouth
Talk a lot of crap, but ain't shit for sure
Bathin' Ape shit that I get for low
I don't pay much and I don't say much
But I still got a swag you should get to know
I flip a show, spend it on apparel
Spanish bitch tell me I look mucho dinero
Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yea
Doper than the 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps
Sorry bitch, I'm paper, chase
When I get where I am, I want my demands
With my nuts in my hand, like fuck you pay me

Kill Them All Tyler I'm Was In This Place (I Got This)
All I Gotta Go With This New Face[Intro: Tyler the Creator]
It's the fucking- AH! Yelled, I came too hard on it. I came way too hard on that. I'm gonna be scaring kids and shit let me, let me tone that down I'm sorry

[Verse 1]
It's the fucking general
Vans, cut shorts, neck covered in colored emerald
The yellow by the blue look like I pissed inside your swimming pool
I'm Mr.Made-a-Bundle, fuck being rapper and lyrical here's a ticket to carnival
Barnacles, now I gotta brag
Bimmer drive right by you niggas like I was kinda fat
With a paint job that's flatter than Miley Cyrus ass
Ludacris niggas is hoping that rapper Tyler Crash
I see a victim
Call the fucking doctors I'm starting to see symptoms
Faggot getting sick again
Fucker get a syringe and a prayer from all your friends
That are actors who pretend with me if they see blood
Cuz, the red and blue like what the fuck's popping?
I'm in black face with white America, and a noose in my pocket
Everyone's dumb or either dead, so you not have an option
So I'm sorry Martian and activists, I'm about to tie knots with
And ain't no one gon' stop shit
I'd rather find my pops locking lips with a hot locksmith
Find I was adopted by chimps and a hippopotamus
Tyler's a fucking animal, when he spit he go ape shit
So it technically makes sense

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Nigga, H
Nobody ever told me that I spill more than I drink
I didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know
Al-Anon meetingAnnotates meeting and greeting boy fickle
Cucumber turn pickle, nigga, nickel by my cellular sickle
Exchange phrases from heroin addicts pistol arms
Niggas go to the drug dealer like bristol farm, when it get it, it's gone
Seated next to Chunky's  hands fidget marmoset monkeys
This ain’t where I’m supposed to be at, how am I supposed to react
When somebody here test my nervous, I’m clean and sober
And still got a lot on my mind that I’m getting over  only getting older
Snow and slush is colder, love don’t get you on the bus
Free rides are in the Rover where tear drops wet on my shoulder
Started hitting bars  whiskey style shit
You know a young nigga always finding new outlets
Mentally I’m just crowded, but shit I guess it’s time to change my outfit

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
Live from the gutter , young stunner  trumps what you niggas blundered
I uppercut 'em by the bundle,  nigga take a number
I'm bout my butter, never let them suckers take me under
Cold like I hate the summer ? You ungrateful son of a bitch
I gave less a fuck and I struck it rich,  suck my dick
Tell the world that I’m coming, don’t fucking spit
Bump your lips , guess you really ain’t sure who you fucking with
You won’t find me on no office shit  I’m semi auto off this shit
My whole approach is arsonic no party be cautious
With  my partners on some raunchy shit, you better use your conscience quick
I swear my whole demeanor all fucked up
Shitting everywhere like I had a meal off the lunch truck
Dumb fuck  come one one it and get your mug bucked
Love what?  No love for these hoes we only love lust
Inhale that marijuana until my lungs bust
Still out for blood when the suns up

[Verse 4: Earl Sweatshirt]
Fuck what you been talking 'bout, nigga, got a toddler reputation
Just from chalking out niggas and bagging 'em up
Dickies baggy, sagging off my ass, abandoned the cuffs
And Wang syndicates the color of the ambulance trucks
Blunt got a nigga feeling like I'm standing on my head
Wolf pack back up out the shed, foaming at the mouth
Got these bitches lip-locking, britches soggy on the couch
Talking shit, bringing profit in and bodies in to count
I told myself just to walk and let the rumours run
Blue golf overalls, jump when them Goombas come
This the fucking sound of chickens coming home and roosting up
The rudest one, make a nigga take a nigga jewels and run
Hand full of cash, other hand full of homes to feed
Who exactly am I supposed to please?
And nigga, who the fuck you supposed to be? Four-five traffic blasting
Tyler pissy cause I'm ashing on his momma Rover seat
Beeline to the substance, impair the judgement
Sticking to the script, thumb sticking to that pump grip
Wolf Gang nigga[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Carter Wong, bring the challenge from the eight masters
Hodgy Long one of them bastards that would head bash ya
Yeah, we Skate Mental, but the meaning of a Thrasher
Is to whiplash out and leave you pussy niggas fractured
I need meds from a mental institution
'fore my brain is revenged, free throw finger shootin'
Record them screamin, interwine them in a loop, then
Take the garbage out back, I pay the homage in fact
I'm throwing T-Bones to these wannabe me clones
And their wannabe me clothes, bitch I'm actually old
I spin ya like the cover we on, you're in between the pages
I'm 21 now been running these Fairfax blocks for ages
Organic for breakfast, free-ranging on stages
It's twelve-noon on my clock, engaged for 12 Gauges
I spit the plague, and don't believe it be a pagan
I'll send your wife dead photos of you taken by Sagan, bitch

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
This that we shit hot shit, piss off custodians
Get rich and marry fat﻿ bitch Lamar Odiom
I’m rich bitch, and y'all's jelly as that jar of petroleum
That I had used when I eloped with him and 40 Mormons and
I'm planning on firing Clancy, ain't no damn controlling him, boy
You can't carry this, them Cannon Nickelodeon boy
My boy Domo higher than fat bitches sodium
And nuggets greener than the fucking can my Arizona's in
I'm sneaking in your kid's ear lobe "Oh, no! It's him! Goblin!"
Dropped like the soap in the tub
Now I have have famous friends who like coke and they're drugged
Dancing with me, Jerry Sandusky, and the Pope in the club
Jerry's trying to get a tug but it isn't paying enough
Now if he doubles it I'll tug it in the bathtub with bubbles
And a rubber ducky that I got on tour Kentucky with some groupies
Where I had got lucky with some sucky-sucky trust me honey bunny
If you fuck me you gonna leave with runny nose
I be running in these hoes ain't no condom on, fucking fuck, me[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang
