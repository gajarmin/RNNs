Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
Put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
First class yo this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like
Hmmm this might be all right
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well uh the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out
I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "Nah forget it, yo homes to Bel-Air!"

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air[Verse 1]
On your mark ready set let's go, dance floor pro
I know you know I go psycho
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Got to get jiggy with it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid, wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it, getting jiggy with it

[Hook]
Getting jiggy with it

[Verse 2]
What you want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)
I makes it hot, getting jiggy with 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly, getting jiggy with it[Intro/Hook: sung]

Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

Verse One: Fresh Prince

Here it is the groove slightly transform
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about a groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if it ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the base and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

Chorus [x2]

Verse Two: Fresh Prince

School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
A back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checking out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Ridin' around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody go
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to
See what you beepin' at
It's like the summers a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and to get you equipped for the summertime

Chorus [x2]

Verse Three: Fresh Prince

It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbeque that's starting at 4
Sitting wit' your friends cause y'all remincise
About the days growing up and the first person you kissed
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playing out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new defintion of summer madness

Chorus [x3][Intro: Will Smith & Sisqo]
Mmmmmmmm...

Wicki-wild wild (doo doo doo doo dooooo)

Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at

Bring all your boys in, here come the poison
Behind my back, all that riffin ya did
Front and center, now where your lip at kid? [S: Lookin at me!]
Who dat is? A mean brother, bad for your health
Lookin damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that
He got mad weapons too? Ain't tryin to hear that
Tryin to bring down me, THE CHAMPION?
When y'all clowns gon' see that it CAN'T BE DONE
Understand me son, I'm the slickest they is

Did I say I'm the slickest they is?
So if you barkin up the, wrong tree we comin

The Wild Wild West[Intro]
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Miami, uh, uh
Southbeach, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

[Verse 1]
Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Everytime the ladies pass, they be like (Hi Will)
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But everytime I come I always wind up stayin
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin

[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami
Bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami
Welcome to Miami

[Verse 2]
Yo I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, (Will we loved your last hit)
So I'm thinkin I'mma scoot me somethin hot
In this salsa- merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay papi!"
Everytime I come to town, they be spottin me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin in the palm trees
Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone
Miami, my second home

[Hook][Will Smith]
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - how your mom an' 'em?

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Mr. Nice Guy, relationship advice guy
Light on the vices, priceless smile
Look at the eyes, got the look
Of a survivor, husband, father
Dissed by Eminem but didn't bother him
Yup well he classy
Big Will just did another 20 mill', walk right past E
I'm a nice guy, why y'all harassin me, huh?
On the radio they be over-exaggeratin
So blase with they lies, they be aggravatin me
Agitatin me, but they be waitin and hatin
And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie
Keep a nice flow for your mom down in Philly
On the news you go if you blow and act silly, y'know?

[Hook: Will Smith]
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

[Will Smith]
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Will's a nice guy, why he's so nice I'd
Let him date my daughter like he was a white guy
Not like the rest, he's a private flight guy
Why, if I were gay on Friday night I'd...
Larry Elder - Uncle Tom?
You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Off, girl, better leave me alone
Before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?

[Hook] - 2X

[Will Smith]
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Uh, my life is a cage but on stage I'm free
Hyped up, psyched up, ready for wildin'
Standing in a crowd of girls like a island
I see the one I want, I said "come here cutie"
I flip her around and then I work that booty
Work the body, work, work the body
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody
Hold up, yo let's get just one thing clear
There's only one reason why I came here

[Bridge]

Well here I go, here I go here I, here I go

[Verse 2]
Yo, dance in the aisles when the Prince steps to it
The rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw
How do I know?, because the crowd went (HO)
In response to the way that I was kicking it
Smooth, an individual, rhymes always original
Like the Dr. Jekyll man and this is my 'Hyde' side
I am the driver and you're on a rap ride
So fellas (yeah)
Are y'all with me? (yeah)
I said fellas (yeah)
Are y'all with me? (yeah)
Why don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do

[Hook]

[Fresh Prince]
Here I go
The F-f-f-f-Fresh P-p-p-p-Prince is who I am
So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam
But sometimes I get n-nervous and start to stutter
And I f-fumble every word, for word I utter
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it
They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling
Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow
So pump up the volume, along with the tempo
Many have died trying to stop my show
I came here tonight to here the crowd go

[Hook]

Don't stop
All night long
And I'm outta here[Will]

Hit ya on the two-way simply to say I gotta see you today
They say love is a gamble and if so, I'm the Belagio I can't lose
And I guess that make you the mirage
Wait you more exotic than that you like the Taj Mahal momma
You a treasure to me life with you is a pleasure to me
And I'm a make sure no man ever measure to me
Like Run and D you and me are together forever

Woke up this morning to invite and couldn't wait to write you
I licked your back and then kissed three little kids that look just like you
Love is magic and it's plain and sometimes it just happens
Saw your picture your so silly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and
You know my heart you know my thoughts so ruffneck yet you're tender
The only person ever locked up safe was to surrender

All my love (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
A thousand kisses from you is never to much

Yo yo me and more it's like a Picasso painted your aura
It's like Beehtoven composed your vocal tones
Wrote band inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man (uh)
Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop

I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)
I'm feeling sad (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Sitting in a hotel room
A thousand miles away from nowhere
Sloped over a chair as I stare
Out the window I sigh as I'm thinking
I take a sip of the juice I been drinking
I'm trapped inside of me
Lost in the memory
Of how things used to be
I think somebody better call a doctor quick
Oh never mind I'm just a little homesick
Thinking of my mum and my dad
And when I was young good damn I was a bad boy
I remember playing catch a girl, kiss a girl
Like a sucker getting slapped every time I pucker
But I kept on chasin
Kept on running kept coming like Jason
Much nostalgia keeps bouncing through

[Hook]
There's no place like home (yeah)
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home

[Verse 2]
Yo there ain't no place like home
And I'm itching for the hood when I cross the states I roam
On tour getting the crowds going wild and
Stacking the honeys in a pile and putting em on file
XL a paragon on the scene
Fancy hotels and getting chauffeured in a limousine
Travel the world and yet my heart is achin
I be Yearning and burning for my mums eggs and bacon
Yo, there ain't no place like home, place like home
Ain't no place like home
Uh, I feel like Dorothy so I tries it
Kicks my heels but my Jordans wouldn't 'ize it
So back to reality
Back to Philly, get back to my family
It's fun to see strange places
But sometimes I wanna see familiar faces
Like charlie mack, bam, nut and wood
Names kinda funny but as friends go real good
Ain't no place like home for true
And that's why

[Hook 2.5x]

[Verse 3]
Sitting in an airport my mouth watering
It's thanks giving day I'm just putting my order in
I call my mum on the phone kind a demanding
Don't stop cooking mum at seven I'm landing
She just laughed and said I don't intend to
My grandma picked up and then she ran the menu
There was turkey and stuffed corn and macaroni and cheese
And sweet potato pies ooh grandma please
On the plane now my mind drifting
Thinking of the way it used to be on Christmas
My mum used to put us to bed about nine
Saying it's, "o f t baby, ol' folks time"
That'd be down stairs laughing and jamming
But then (boo) raise ya seats back for landing
I walked in the house I felt the love
And my grandma saw me and screamed
Now here come all the hugging
I got such a feeling of emotion and love
Because can't nobody can hug you the way your grandma does
Give me a shovel and put some feed on my plate
My father said grace right before we all ate
And after he was finished I put a p.s. on
I said yo, "there ain't no place like home
And I thank God to be here with all of you"
Cause I was feeling

[Hook]

[Outro]
On behalf of DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince
We'd like to take this opportunity to wish y'all a (There's no place like home)
Happy Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
And all that sumthin sumthin (There's no place like home)
But we'd also like to encourage you
To take this opportunity to pause (There's no place like home)
Just take a minute and stop and look around at your family
And thank God for them (There's no place like home)
Because they not always be here with you
Peace
There's no place like home
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
There's no place like home[Ali]
I ain't draft dodging. I ain't burning no flag, and I ain't runnin' to Canada. I'm stayin' right here. You want to send me to jail? Fine, you go right ahead. I've been in jail for 400 years. I could be there for four or five more, but I ain't goin' no 10,000 miles to help murder and kill other poor people. If I want to die, I'll die right here, right now, fightin' you, if I want to die. You my enemy, not no Chinese, no Vietcong, no Japanese. You my opposer - when I want freedom. You my opposer - when I want justice. You my opposer - when I want equality. Want me to go somewhere and fight for you? You won't even stand up for me right here in America, for my rights and my religious beliefs. You won't even stand up for my right here at home.[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
Now let's get this party started off the right way
Oww and HOE I think the crowd might say
When we're on stage you know you can't resist
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}
I'm the ultimate and that's all I can say
I sat down for about eight hours today
Tryin to figure out the proper description of ME
And I came to the decision that
There's no one syllable or phrase
That can adequately describe this new craze
But I'll sum it up in one sentence, let's see
OK, I've got it, "All praise me!"
Yup -- that's about the size of it
I know it sounds kinda strange, doesn't it?
But when we're on the stage you know you can't resist
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
It was a Friday afternoon if I remember it correctly
But I can't quite recall the time exactly
But it was somewhere around, two or three or four
Oh forget it, let's just go on
Anyway I stepped out of school
Sneaks were Gucci shirt was Polo and my pockets were full
Blew some kisses to the girlies cause I like to tease
They started chantin my name, I said, "Ladies.. please!"
I grabbed my friends and hopped in my Benz
Grabbed a Martini and Rossi passed out to my posse
Things were lookin good. I had plans for later on
Plans for Donna Michelle, plans for Stacy LeShaun
Word! I was ready, I wonder if Jeff's home
Let me give him a call, on my car phone
Yo Jeff, what's shakin?
[Jazzy Jeff] Coolin, whassup?
[Fresh Prince] Girlies
[Jazzy Jeff] I'm with it, come pick me up!!!
[Fresh Prince] I caught up with Ready on the way to Jeff's
A whole carload of girlies and they ALL was def
We walked into Jeff's and said, "Girls, you can't resist"
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh] Yo Jeff man, are you with me?
{Jeff scratches.. "Hit it!"}
[Fresh] I didn't hear you man, are you with me?
{Jeff scratches.. "Hit it!"}
[Fresh] I'm with it to GET BUSY!

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
Ready Rock C, give Jeff a hand!

{Ready Rock beatboxes while Jeff scratches the same sample}

[Scratched] "As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"

[Fresh Prince]
Throw away them chairs, cause you don't need em anymore
Cause this hip-hop hit, is gonna keep you on the floor
If you dance everyday or if you never danced before
It doesn't matter if it's {"somethin like this"}
Time is essential, so let's make the best of it
Today we don't have a lot of time, so let's not throw it all away
Let's use this time in a very special way
Let's use it, {"somethin like this"}
I went outside at about 12:30
I saw a couple girlies, and they were lookin pretty good!
.. if you know what I mean
So I freshened my breath and stepped on the scene
I walked over to em, stepped in between them
One stepped to the other, "I think that I've seen him
Somewhere before." I said, "Sweetheart, you might have"
She said, "Oh yeah, it was last night
At that party." I said, "Yeah I tried to talk to you there
But you were acting as if you were scared."
She said, "I'm not scared now." I said, "Bet, well let's go then."
She said, "But hold up, what about my friend?"
I said, "I got a friend!" So the three of us left
Went back to my crib and gave a call to Jeff
Five minutes later Jeff walked in
And I thought to myself, "Yeah, now the fun begins!"
But the girls started buggin, and they said, "Now we want
Dinner in the best restaurant in town
We want caviar and lobster tails, both by candlelight
And Dom Perignon." I said, "Yeah right!"
Y'all must be crazy, and Jeff said
[Jazzy Jeff] "Y'know?
I really think it's time for these ladies to go."
[Fresh Prince] We walked em to the door and told em they were dismissed
And it went a little {"somethin like this"} *door slams*
But that was okay, that was alright
Cause we still had fun that night -- yaknowit!
The moral of the story is plain and visible
We always watch out for those kind of women
But the past is the past and the present is the present
And we feel that everyone should be sitting down
{"so you all don't miss"}
{"As we go a little somethin like this, HIT IT!"}

Big Willie (repeated)

[Verse]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face
Me and Jeff again, "Oh my" you say
1985 to the Y2K
The new millenium, prophecies, I'm fulfillin' 'em
Everywhere I go, people be yelling "yo, that's Will and them"
I check the rhyme like Quest
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper/actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap
Tap like Gregory Hines, read the headlines
Hip-hop's number one son still shines[Intro: Left Eye]
This one goes out to all the big willies

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad and we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green v
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas boss players all across the board move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight

[Hook: Will Smith]
Now how we do it
(you know it's Big Willie style baby)
Now how we doing it
(you know it's Big Willie style)
Repeat

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down (boom)
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will Nas Escobar J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representing like it's ladies night
Coming right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink
Rocks in the link, In the drop with a mink
Like my shit don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam
Blowing up spots then running off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passing
Breaking you down like fractions
While we be rapping about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it happen
With Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace
With a sweet smell
This female leading the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real?
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Will Smith]
Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it

[Hook]

[Outro: Left Eye]

Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude

So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now

One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right there
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember

When the enemy is near the elite is hear
So have no fear just let me see you

Ha![Verse 1]
Yo, yo forget the club
Today we play in the block
It's goin' down and it's blazzin' hot
Jeff pop the new CD turn tables joints
You just got to get the amps from Boogie
Get the van from Rock and then
Call up Ishkabibble's, Jim's and Pat's
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sendin' 'em back
And get my mic right
If I get hyped, I might rap
Then take the speakers find a good spot
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top
You wanna come, you got to come on your feet
Ain't nothin' like havin' a party
When it's out in the street, come on

[Hook- Tra-Knox]
Nine o'clock I'mma call my crew
And ten o'clock we gonna roll on through
I don't know what you gon do
But whatever you do, hit the block party tonight

All the ladies rollin' up with friends
And don't be late or you won't get in
Our party's packed from begining to end
Everybody tell a friend that the block party's tonight

[Verse 2]
It's ain't nothin' like
Havin' a party on the block
When everybody know everybody on the block
And everybody on the block
Come to the party on the block
And when the sun drop, (we don't stop)
Funny how fast they travel the word
A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard
That it's a block party down in West Philly
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy
Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap
Jeff got it... jam packed
Everybody, hands in the air
(Just get your hands in the air!)
Yo Philly! (dat's where the party's at!)
Uuh, D.C. y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)
A-T-L (dat's where the party's at!)
West side! (dat's where the party's at!)
Mid-west y'all (dat's where the party's at!)
Dirty South now (dat's where the party's at!)
Yo, I can't hear y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)
Where ever we at! (dat's where the party's at!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo and when the sun drop
Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop
All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on
All day long I been plottin' on this nice john
It's ten o'clock now Jeff is tryin' to hype me
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?
Hear the crowd cheer, broguht a little smile out
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out
I know he's old, but
Mabye it's a slight chance
I could get my brother hype
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not
Lemme get the crowd jumpin'
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something
I'm like Rob Base- I wanna rock right now
Y'all know who run the block right now
All we need is a mic and a beat
And a couple of speakers
And some turn tables out in the street, come on!

[Hook][Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom

Chorus(Will Smith talking)
I believe in God
I believe in destiny
Not destiny in the sense of all of our actions being pre-determined
But destiny in the sense, of our ability to choose
Our ability to choose, who we are and who we're supposed to be

(Will Smith rapping)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I was born to reign
Point blank my name, to be etched in stone, destiny pre-ordained
Tryin' to live righteous, fighting for life
This my life, and that's why I go lite on my vices
Tighten the vices of truth, on the ruthless
This rhyme and the crime is they minds is just useless
The path of the poison, the Genesis of the genocide
You and your boys, tryin' to decide
What to write, but your pen is a sword
And the blade has been forged, young minds gettin' gorged
States have been altered, by liquor, by weed
And then hate gets exalted, as art falls to greed
Choices is made, as the voices is laid
On the track, contract, ya souls the wage, sold ya wage
Did you see his new Benz, but your mic a syringe
Now you proud of your binge, gotta lot of new friends, gotta lot of new ends
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen
Giving false accounts, of your accounts amounts
Amounts of fans treason, stands to reason
Since your inception, laced with deception
And bred false affection, it must parish
From a terrace, I see the fire burning the streets
But I won't shield my eyes to the heat
Born to Reign
Oooooooooh
I was Born to Reign
Oooooooooh
I was Born to Reign[Tatyana]
Uh, uh, uh
Oh, oh yeah
Baby

[Tatyana]
From the moment that I saw you babe
All I think about is loving you
Every time that you are near
I just can't help but stare
I'm dreaming of eternity with you
So maybe I can

1 - [Tatyana]
Run away with you
Imagine all the things we'd do
Call my name
And make this fantasy for real
Run away with you
Imagine all the things we'd do
Call my name
And make this fantasy for real

2 - [Tatyana]
Can't hold it, I can't fight it
Want you and I can't deny it
It's all about the things you do
Boy, you knock me out
Can't hold it, I can't fight it
Want you and I can't deny it
It's all about the things you do
Boy, you knock me out

[Tatyana]
Can you feel the vibes I'm sending, baby?
All my energy and thoughts towards you
There's now way I could let go
Of all these dreams and hopes
Anxieties so deep, feelings so new
Just maybe I can

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

[Tatyana]
Falling for you, this love's a TKO
Falling for you, baby
Falling for you, this love's a TKO
Falling for you, baby

[Will Smith](Tatyana)
Uh, uh, uh
Here it is a groove slightly transformed
Again, but with a Tatyana Ali spin
I knew ever since she was ten
As Fresh Prince from back then
I had a synch she would win
Whatever clique she was in
Now she's all grown up not Ashley
Mad sexy, true but classy
She in the fast lane under my wing
Kissing the sky
Tatyana Ali, girl you knock me out
(Cause boy you knock me out)

Repeat 2 till end[Fresh Prince]
It's new.  It's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary
A literary genius and a superior beat creator
Have come together and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance? We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk

It was kind of an accident, the way that it happened
One day I was rappin, and on the beat, Jeff was backin me up
And all of a sudden, he brought in a cut
And I dropped my microphone and said, "What the...?
Hold up, Jeff, wait a minute, play it"
He just smiled and said, "Yeah def ain't it?"
It was {funky} it made wanna {get, get down!}
And we knew almost at once it was the {brand new funk}
So we continued to listen to it
And we knew it was def when I started rappin to it
So I gave a hi-five to Jeff
And without hesitation popped in my cassette
I took it home that night, and analyzed it
Rewound the tape over and over, and memorized it
That Friday, we went to the club
And out and out cold tore it up!
You shoulda seen the people dancin and shakin and movin and jumpin
And spinnin and clappin, while the beatbox was groovin
And screamin and yellin while on the microphone I was flowin
Fresh rhymes I was showin, the people say, "Yo keep goin"
So I continued to rock, while Jeff was on the beatbox
Special assistance from my homeboy Ready Rock
People fought just to get up front
To get a bird's eye view of what we call the brand new funk

Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *

Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat}
Yo Jeff! {Rock the beat with your hands..}
* Jazzy Jeff cuts and scratches *

Now get funky with the beat!
* Jeff starts spinning backwards *
Now turn it all around!

The most original, amazing, astounding, miraculous
Remarkable, startling, sensational, stupendous
Music that has ever been created
Is ours - but believe me it was complicated
But we have done it, so now we can breathe
A long awaited sigh of relief
This isn't a publicity stunt

Excuse me Miss, can we chat for a second
I'd ask how you doin', but you fine I reckon
Wait, do you have a man, cause I ain't' into homewrecking
No?. .Aight cool just checking
Look, from a hundred yards you caught my eye
An all my boys said I didn't have the heart to say hi
I'd like to have your number you don't have ta give it now
But if you diss me while they lookin I'm a never live it down
Y'know what I mean, Aww damn, my name's Will
Maxine. Pleasure to meet you, look here's the deal
Can I sit? Thanks, now I don't mean to objectify
But this the metaphore that crossed my mind
You sweet, good enough to eat
Make a brother wanna TLC--Creep
A brother can't sleep
It's like a kid fallin for you
So here's my own private nickname, I'm a call you

[Hook]
Candy (No Doubt, Do you wanna bounce?)
It's the same feelin I always feel together but now
Candy

All I thought about was livin life beside you, Boo
All I wanna do is be the perfect guy to you
Tell you the truth, it's like (Candy) cause I'm feelin like its callin me
You're tryin ta hold on, but fallin
Seem quite far ta me
I stay strong but it's hard to be
Cause somethin bringin out the dog in me
(It's like Candy) when I'm keepin my zone
Chat on the phone, I lower my tone
Steady plottin on takin ya home
Gettin all inside of your dome, makin you moan
You shoulda known (It's like Candy)
As I'm seein you here, Mommy I know your peepin my stare
And feelin my glare, brother thinkin bout unrollin the bear
Strokin your hair, (Touchin me where?) Yeah there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know the deal, I talked to Mary Jane and she said
Your ex-boyfriends Mike and Ike are both Lemonheads
I ain't tryin ta player hate girl I know
That you go with Bazooka Joe
Now you know he don't love you like that
He tryin ta get a Reeses piece of the Kit-Kat
Really hon, what he need is a jawbreaker
Cause I'm the one that'll love you baby Now and Later
Be my Peppermint Paddy with a Hundred wishes
An I'll be your Hershey daddy with a hundred kisses
Get the Twins M&M's, they booked all outta flights today

I don't care what it cost, girl a Hundred Grand
We could snicker all night at my Jolly Ranch
Just me and you, I'll call your friends up too

Everywhere we go, downtown or to a show
We have two necessities, Charlie Mack and our limo
He's feared by suckers yet he's loved by kids
Pay attention and let me tell you who Charlie Mack is
He is our homeboy from around the block
He's regarded through the city as the hip-hop cop
Height about 6'6", weight about 290
Everywhere I go, Charlie Mack is right behind me
He never laughs, never smiles nor sweats
He doesn't breaks arms or legs, only spines or necks
He once KILLED a man cause he would not let go of his Eggo
Apollo Creed is a SUCKER, Charlie Mack could beat Drago
He could bench about three-hundred pounds
The cops all take a vacation when Charlie's in town
He's the toughest around, so everywhere that I go he goes
He's Charlie Mack and he's the first out the limo

[Fresh Prince]
I guess you're wonderin why he's the first out
The limo, yo, let me give you this bit of info
So you'll know the things that Charlie can do
And you'll know every single reason why he's down with the crew
The limo picks up about a half past six
With the radio blastin our latest hit
It's me, Jeff, Ready Rock, Omar and J.L
Charlie Mack is up front as we depart the hotel
First we cause chaos throughout the city streets
Then maybe stop at Burger King for a bite to eat
And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place
Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face
He's not a troublemaker, in fact, he's a troublebreaker
And if somebody gets dumb, well it'll only take a
Second or two, after some fools snaps
Law and order is restored by my hero Charlie Mack
Wheel off into the limo, and head for the jam
Charlie cracks all the knuckles on both of his hands
And when we pull up to the show, the routine is unrehearsed
It's just natural that we let Charlie hop out first
He clears the crowd without sayin a word
Man, that's the loudest silence I've ever heard
A lot of times guys test him by tryin to bug
He just leaves ring imprints all over their mugs
He's a terminator, a Hercules of sorts
Man to hell with chess, he likes physical sports
You may not have known before but now you know
The reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo

[Fresh Prince]
We'd like to apologize to all of our fans
But please don't touch us when we're at our jams
Cause Charlie don't like folks around us when we're doin a show
And if he punches you, uh-oh, better get Maaco!
Still you weak rap dudes tempers are hot
Just because I've got somethin that YOU AIN'T GOT
If you want to get physical, rowdy or try to bomb me
I won't get excited, I'll just say, "Yo Charlie!"
You shoulda been kind, you shouldn't have snapped
Charlie only hit you once and now you're takin a nap
And when he leaves you decaptitated, crushed in the dust
You'll look up and see your girl in the limo with us
You may think that that's enough homeboy but I think not
Charlie kick his face again I think you missed a spot
I roll down the limo window and yell, "Bon voyage"
You'll see your girl buck naked givin Charlie a message
I'm serious. I'm not jokin. No doubt
You know how many doubters bones have been broken?
You may not have known before but now you know
The reason why Charlie Mack is the first out the limo

[Fresh Prince]
Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo
He's Charlie Mack.. the first out the limo

In closing, we'd like to say this to you bustaz
If you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up, plus get
Embarassed and laughed at by all of your friends
And if you cross Charlie Mack it's the beginning of the end
Of life as you know it. You might not die, sir
But if you're not dead, you'll wish you were
But if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go
You can bug with Charlie Mack cause he's the first out the limo

He's Charlie Mack
And he's the first out the limo[Verse 1]
Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venitian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question, if the pradda dressin and the Gucci
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever

[Hook]
I wanna stay with you forever
I wanna spend all my life with only you
I wanna stay, lets stay together
Chasing forever, with only you

[Verse 2]
Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
Fore I die I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust
An taught me monogomy is uh, monogamous
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carrats than even bugs could eat in a week
An the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad
Havin more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

[Hook][Will Smith]
Uhh.. hoo!
Uh, yo, Big Will, in the place to be
Mic check and uh, mic check and uh
Uh, uh, yo
Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Would you love me if my pants was hand-me-downs?
Hah, huh?
Yo, yo

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out and about
8 to 80 all walks of life be shoutin it out
Usually when it's time for an encore I hear it
But when I did somethin hot it broke in the spirit
It's weird, it's like a double-edged sword when y'all applaud
It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile
How do I respond to the phrase "I love you Will!"
Kinda heavy when I hear it - be like "Damn f'real?"
In a way it make me wanna stay strong and moral
But history, say I could be gone tomorrow
And though my future look floral, it feel like I'm open
For much pain, when people stop shoutin my name
And doubtin my game, likin others better than me
Writin, letters to him instead of letters to me
A veteran B, I know the game, but do me this here
In your heart be clear before you bless my ear, c'mon

[Hook: Will Smith]
Could you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Could you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?
Will my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
I pray before I sit with a pen and a pad
A birth of a thought occurs, and it calls me dad
And to the universe an idea, released from me
Just a CD? Nah man, a piece of me
But you can't see it that when you be dancin B
As I asked you a question that's how you answer me
So when you don't dance it be like I'm chokin from cancer
Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive, sure
I rationalize, like oh I see
But if you don't like my cut it's like you don't like me
Some stuff works, some works, not so well
It's like you work like hell, still get hurt like hell
Yo, it can tear you apart
But don't let your wins go to your head, your losses go to your heart
And if we ever get the pleasure to meet
Be clever wit and please measure what you yell in the street, c'mon

[Hook][Will Smith]
Uh, uh, uh
What?
Whoo! Ha-ha
Yeah mic check
Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic
Alright now let's go yo

[Lil' Kim](Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?

[Will Smith]
Here come the butter baby
Bringing it smooth and hot
Got the staff from K-B
Singing this groove a lot
So I got my spiral notebook
Drink and pen
And then abracadabra y'all, done it again
Married but I flirt a little
Siking the ladies
In the videos I be bringing it like Mike in the 80s
Level of success based on my level of risk
You've been yelling for the lyricist
Then reveling this
Old school hip-hop a beat and a rhyme
Some chapters and some verses, you seek and you find
Look no further here I go, Big Will, Johnny Inferno
Flame by hip-hop burns eternal
All aboard on my train to fame
Rappers hoping that it'd rain
Trying to stop the game
But rain can't stop me
I got a coat in the crib
Hey look y'all yellow bricks quit beefin' at the whiz, what?

[Lil' Kim](Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Uh, bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?
(Lil' Kim y'all what?)

[Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim, Big Will give a damn how y'all feel
Hate, but on the real, Big Will is seven mill
If I wasn't on top I'd have a lot less ends
I'd most likely have a lot less friends
You know what I learned, let them keep talking
Uh-huh, pull up in an Azure and watch them keep walking
[Will Smith]
Kim haters be making me wanna flip and react
[Kim]
No-no-no, chill Will and let me do that (alright)
Huh, I gotta eat can't get with broke cats
You know the queen like to be where the money at
I'm the mother, y'all like adopted in this
Call us Mr. and Mrs. Papadapolis
When will y'all learn?
Y'all just interns
You gon' get what you earn, just wait your turn
I rock telephones with the TV screens
So I can have real phone sex
Know what I mean?

[Lil' Kim](Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Yo I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?

[Will Smith]
It's the fun king, I've been doing one thing
Running things for years, give me one swing
And it's out of here, crack!
Over the fence ladies and gents
Keeping rappers impressed but depressed by my current events
[Kim]
Yes Lord!
[Will]
Big Will swinging the best sword
What'cha flexing for, don't be testing me boy
Messing with me boy, you're stepping on the root of a daisy
I have you're girl saying
[Kim]
Will why you do that to my baby?
Yo Will, what they looking stupid in the face for?
What? I can't have rocks the size of a baseball
Trust me when I cop I make sure mine cut glass
Never spend my last, like a crack head for the blast
Y'all can kiss my ass acting like you know me
You ain't got a Rolley, take this one here you owe me
All in together now, wrists looking better now
Screw greyhound bound, I'm getting cheddar now
[Will]
Burrrr! When she step up in the scene!
Who! Ice gleam, y'all scream, "Bow to the Queen!"
Ring on her finger mad phat
Leonardo DiCaprio saw it and caught a flashback
*mouth noise*
All you rappers wanna snap, Jazzy Jeff got my back
*mouth noise*
Lil' Kim bring it back, Lil' Kim press the rack
[Lil' Kim]
Yeah I'm short and sexy, my love's divine
My name is QB and I blow your mind with the
*mouth noise*
When I step up, body lookin' hot
All the music just stopArtist: Will Smith
Album: Big Willie Style
Song: Don't Say Nothin'

Yo
When I released my first single back in like '86
People was like oh you know "that's popcorn" and you know "they weak"
You know then I mess around I go world trade on them
Bangin' out them multi-plats they still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice don't say nothing

Take your place allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country
Grammy winner soon to be oscar nominee
Who he? "that's dressed jiggy, straight from west Philly"
Thought I was whack cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
The ill kid
Hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with come on keep it real kid
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me
Really don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas chatting with Oprah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados chillin' with Jada
Vertex is me the magnanamous
Got you sayin' "damn I've always been a fan of his..."
Y'all know how it is, oh wait, hold up y'all don't
Look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't

Just don't say nothing

Man I love being me ready to rock the block
With some more hot top notch ---- for you to cop
No more mr. nice guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(he soft he whack man that ain't real rap)
You beleive that
It hurt me at first but it's cool
Took the insults feed it to my ego used it for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out
(oh my lord)
Did you see it's that brother from
(ID4)
Now can I please get
(a picture and your signature)
Sure you can miss
(oh my god my girlfriends they ain't gonna beleive this)
Worldwide wait nah hold up galactic
Hear my name don't nothing change but the accent
Bangok to Madagascar they wanna see me
Prince epe in Spain Japan I'm cota eshe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private
And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know he's only four taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man who'd a thought my life would be such an interesting topic
Well y'all know how it is wait hold up y'all don't
Well look here y'all don't say nothing than I won't

Just don't say nothing
Just don't say nothing
Just don't say nothing
Just don't say nothing

Go ahead adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
I'm about to show you how a man like me works
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seater
Fifty inch sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
Cause I'm about to get two thumbs ten toes one knee and probobly a couple
Of elbows
Cause yo I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film fests to vos and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so-called friends who been nothing but actors
You're way of carachter but now who's the bomb
It's Will from west Phil just slightly transformed
Y'all know what it is
Ah damn that's right y'all don't
But look here y'all don't say nothing then trust me I won't

Just don't say nothing
Just don't say nothing
Just don't say nothing
Just don't say nothing
