[Busta Rhymes]
Here in 1992 we present
The fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form and one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!

[Kid Hood]
Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
F it (shit) I lick buckshots
Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra, extra, pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say "oh no," you bitch ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man

[Phife Dawg]
Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips
The five-foot assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet cause I'm kickin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop
The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and "Remember the Time" (Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin cause you sure can't rhyme

[Cut Monitor Milo]
(Big up, big up!) Enter new identity
Next to say something cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique?
(Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
Milo in De Dance is the new identity
One two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
Ten to one that I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Kicking right inna your what's it not
I could rock longer but fair is fair
So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)
C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)

[Charlie Brown]
Makin moves y'all (Moves y'all!) On and on and on
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn
(Who's that?!) just one of the L.O.N.S
And a Tribe Called Quest (East coast) to West
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica
To all MCs fall like the Battlestar Galactica
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin (Style!)
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle
Representation, sensationalization
"Scenario" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so
(Here we go yo!) Yeah
Force, Main Source LP on the rise
In living color we'll see seen through original eyes
And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh
(Ooh ahh, ooh ahh!) There it is baby pah

[Dinco D]
Flying in on a limb, slim trim, D I am
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim
Sight we be right, be polite for my mics
Like I'm like (See sick, see syke)
And slip away, and off to the Poconos
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
Yamaha (Ay-Ha May!)
Let's split the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)
Enough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys
Bed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale
Bounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled
In the hallways always ringing with a (Ho!)
This one two times nine on the Scenario

[Q-Tip]
Check it out everybody, rhymes and mics
Black Benz gettin looped (Doin' what they like!)
Eight black brothers in the public eye
If you listen very close, I will tell you why
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down
Will commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)
In-terrogation for the knockin of the box
The boom-box ruler, controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, nine-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)
The meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey what we gon do (Dooo) in '92
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground
What's goin on my man? (Goddamn!) And now my brain is hurtin'
Listen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, cause I'm in the mood
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes
Body drippin with blood comin out your nose
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin for?
(More!) Only your sacred and pure
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
Yeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my roach spray (Anyway!)
Ding-A-Ling, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School
Mad brother when stealthy RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin' I see my influence still shinin'
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
That's the Scenario![Hook x4]
La Schmoove, yo we don't got nothing to prove

[Verse 1: Poc Fu]
Yo, when I was small they used to tease me
Because my hair was peasy, hard and greasy
But now I'm living well like George and Wheezy
So easy (WHAT) does it (YO)
Is it because I'm rocking -- beats, beats, beats
Fu-Manchu'n cause I'm doing what just had to be done
Now we in there like swimwear, girls calling me hon
Give me hugs, little peck, mucho tongue, lots of sex
Nuff respects to my bros that live on five-six street (RIGHT)
I'm smashing monster mashing boom bashing in a fashion
Which is wild now I smile when I whip-lash MC's with my style
Call me Cuckoo, I'm making buku bucks
I'm geared and fully prepared to tear all MC's that are schmuks
For bros who sleep and cavity creep and listen when I talk
As I soothe in the groove, cause I'm smooth like Mr. Rourke
Doobely-zoo Mr. Wu, no need to be rude but F.U
Cause I ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chip Fu]
Leave it to Beaver'-arriva, derci
Heavens to mercy ba FU sayanora
Adios muchachos dorme vous unbuckle my Fu-Schnick shoe
Mr. Chip Fu, about to wreck shop
With the Judo (CHOP) a Judo (CHOP) a Judo chop (CHOP)
Yo zilch kaput me nada none son
I don't think so, so take a look at
A Superfly big Jimmy the Honeynut Cheerio Bee
Ba schnicker bah snchnucker
I ams what I ams that's all what I ams
My lyrics are never done
I'm the big John Elmer Glue the Elmer the Fudd
Al Bundy the Bud Light stud
Come like tongues lashes, with the quickness
Moc and Poc is, my witness
Ask the Kung about my tongue and the styles that I brung instead
I'm the Ali Babi cutty rankin shuba-dib-da-dabble
Jaw Boy Wonder Bread dread, BUM BA READ
These lyrics ah-come out of mi head, BUM BA READ
Mr. Chip Fu's gon stay' di-di, da-di-di, dra-dread
You said I couldn't rap, but I really wrecked shop
And I don't stop drop, I get props
I pick up the mic drop a style and pattern and fashion
And all MC's jaws drops down
My accent, you're mocking my clothes, you're clocking
Ripping MC's to smithereens to their
Ribbidy-diddiby-Pippi Long-STOCKINGS
So don't step to Chip, I'm on the La Schmoove tip
You'll say Drats I really failed again plus he sank my Babble-ship
So oooh, shit G, wa-wa or biscuit
Rip it and be specific doin it terrific when I kicks it
Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang, Pepe LePew, Pepe LePew
La Schmoove, yo I ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Now here I go, once again with the ill flow
Other MC's that rap, their style is so-so
Phife Dawg was never the type that ever lacked skills
I just stay true to my roots and then I get ill
Twenty years of age but yet I still see (KNOWLEDGE)
And this year, was so-called, my Senior year in (COLLEGE)
But I chose to pursue, in a field called music
And with some hype beats and breaks you know I won't refuse it
Get on the board lay down the track and I'll do ten laps
Pass the pen, pass the pad, and I'll kick nuff (RAPS)
Just come inside your jam and witness who is boss
And it won't be Tony Danza nor Diana Ross
As small as I am, I still can pack jams
Do a freestyle and step, but yet I still slam
Not trying to say that no one can get with me
Not only is it the lyrics I write, it's my delivery
Name one rapper that you know who has this high-strung voice
My name's Malik and I'm unique, in other words top choice
Nothing commercial bout this, it's mainly hardcore
Now that you got what you want, do you want more
Because I got more in store

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Moc Fu]
MC, the Shining One, a.k.a. The Golden Child
I have a grin at times but then throw up a fake smile
Vaseline Intensive Care, don't fear mon frere
Sak Pase, everybody that rappin, G pull his hair
Back in the groove, it's no way you can handle this
Shit so fly, that you can call it scandalous
Cause I mani-fest in, words that I'm preaching
Unleashing you now seek the sounds that I'm teaching
I hear (NOT) see (NOT), knots to makes butts (ROCK)
I rides rhythm to the beginnin, then won't stop
The Chinese Son of Sam, the Skipper's Peter Pan
The rootinest tootinest cowboy in the East
Releasing a new type of lyrical lingo
Single, +The Alarm+, the girls cooties I will tingle
No expiration date, so you know I won't (EXPIRE)
No skippin a weekly check, so I don't have to (RETIRE)
Write, the ca-pital, M.O
Chip Fu with the Kung-Fu givin shouts on my show
Ir-regular styles is here too
Tripped, boo-boo, you first made a mistake
Not Alexander but considered to be Great
Great, but, like the Grape Ape
Fake, the moves, and your ankles I will break
Break, or broken, the M.O., has spoken
Movements on the slick, taking the train you need a token
I guess not, cause you pause for the cause
You either biting your nails, or start picking straws
Holy Mick I'm living large just like trunk jewels
Nuff respects to many minds, Ah-OWWWWWWWWWWWEE

[Hook][Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Coming from the urban city ghettos
But we still King, queen, natural born rebels
Black tails, crack sales
Heavy [?], we do- (push it along)
We done seen everything
From niggas, gun fights, sellin' dope, gettin cream
It ain't the pressure, you can ask my ancestors
Trifecta from the Tribeca
I bet you we a (push it along)
Resurrect, lil' effort
Lil' 17 tryna' microphone check it
Niggas tryna' stress it
Rather see me Pyrexin'
That ain't me, that ain't we
We the essence

[Hook]
Push it along (uh-uh), push it along (okay)
Push it along, just push it along (come on)

[Verse 2: T3]
It's too much to spit, my life is kind of tragic
I'd rather spit a hit for the jam and be Kobe
Still on the quest like Phife and Jarobi
Gotta (push it along, just)
Tired of being bummed out

[Phife Dawg]
Yeah, It's been a minute
Nothing short of 60 seconds
Can't stomach where I come from
Hard to eat breakfast
You ain't refined when you tryna' get acceptance
Gold Lexus, Rolex's, stupid dumb necklace
(Push it along)

[Baatin]
You see the rap game is stitched in my hoodie
Like, when I'm on the mic to excite
You like I'm goodie
[?]
You guessed this, what is this
Spit [?] when I kick this, relentless

[Phife Dawg]
Yeah, you did it to death
But that's a death wish
Gotta do it big like you Precious
Let's just

[Hook]
Push it along (uh-uh), push it along (okay)
Push it along, just push it along (come on)

[Bridge - 3x]
Push it with me, you gotta pull it (yeah)
You gotta do what you do
We keep it movin', yes
You gotta

[Verse 3: Young RJ]
Fuck the next saint
Young Trey got his cream on
Block got him braced
But his [?], the love gone
Bout' to move up, the Jefferson theme song
The means are extreme, but what he goin' lean on

[]
[?]
Who playin' hotta'?
Trash rhymers back off
Your mics gettin' cut off
New York or Rock City
We never rhyme soft
Emphasizin' true spit
Dat girth and grit (uh, yeah)

[Young RJ]
Rose Gold dreams, high self-esteem
Livin' on your knees ain't [?]
Clock don't stop, so the [?]
Don't clothes shop, tryna' cop
Heavy triple beams
You better (push it along)

[]
Like Tribe's Instinctive Travels
[?] you know the boy, Mutty Ranks
Back in the [?]
[?] hiatus, I stays ready to battle
King from Queens, get your ass out of my castle

[Young RJ]
Yeah, preacher told 'em but it ain't clickin'
Light switches get dimmer when it's gray and the sun missin'

You gotta do what you do
We keep it movin', yeah
You gotta

[Bridge - 2x]
Push it with me, you gotta pull it, yeah with me
You gotta do what you do
We keep it movin', yes
You gotta

Just push[Intro Cj Fly]
I'm feeling the energy inside the room tonight
The tunes are nice, hey girlfriend ah you mi like [x4]

[Verse 1 Cj Fly]
We just happened to as meet in the club
I was there reading vibes, she was cheesing so much
Put my seeds on her buns
Feel it in her guts, anytime she take a crunch
Tried to take my spread when I seen her for lunch
The number I think she wanted when she ate
Driven going the distance with a couple different place
Overall they over shaped, had them digging in the crates
Got my chicks by the dozen, six that I done did
Became so redundant, used to front but now they want me
Find that shit so funny
My only prob with cam, is she loves to use a cam, posting pics on Instagram
Caption say she with her man
My only prob with sharon, is she do way too much sharing
It's apparent she don't care about her appearance
With her parents, looking for a baller with a bigger hoop earrings
It's all def true it must be F'ing up her hearing
If Emma leave then I go fuck with Emily
Or probably Bethany she live down in Beverly
You invite her to the crib then she'll probably never leave
Everyone had a turn, name rings bells on every street
The girls that I like, set goals in their life
Wannabe known as a wife not a ho for the night
Got this girls number, didn't know what to write
I Guess she wasn't my type

[Hook]
I'm feeling the energy inside the room tonight
The tunes are nice, hey girlfriend ah you mi like [x4]

[Verse 2 A la Sole]
She wanna go get me now cause my team in the spotlight
She better be going down like she plumbing on the cockpipe
We at the top flight, without an elevator button
If I'm good for anything,you know I'm good for nothing
I roll the sumption then she come and try to puff it
I get up in her guts,no dutch but I stuff it
She cause a ruckus, when we fucking cause she love it
She never want to leave I wear her out like my bucket
We chilling like a villain, your chick a super ho
And I'm iron man I'm sticking ironing
But she can't leave the kid cause she used to pros
So don't fight it then just invite a friend
Like who am I to judge shawty preferences
Girl I steady turn heads like an exorcist
Straight exing chicks who are classy but they ashy
I know to take a L like a chair when they pass me

[During Hook]
[CJ Fly]
Yo phife it's fly what's good?
[Phife Dawg]
Yo what up son, you good?
[CJ Fly]
Everything good man
[Phife Dawg]
Yo member when I came to the chi to see ol roc[?] I think it was New Year's Eve?
[CJ Fly]
Yeah man how could I forget, shit was crazy
[Phife Dawg]
I ain't tell you what happen to me that night B?
[CJ Fly]
Nah what happen?
[Phife Dawg]
Let me tell you wha rude boi
[CJ Fly]
*Laughing*
[Phife Dawg]
You ain't gonna believe this
[CJ Fly]
Aww man

[Verse 3 Phife Dawg]
Okay I feel the energy inside the room no doubt
All eyes on me as if 2Pac touched down
New Year's Eve, Chitown favorite city (Word up)
Maceo from dela spinning, got the shrine turnt up
Pro era was performing, hey they ain’t no joke
Ooo, two mami’s in the [?], with that good ass smoke
Marisol from southside, Monique from hyde park
Just my luck, one likes them short, the other likes them dark
They mentioned they would love to start the New Year right
Love the fact that 3-1-2 chicks be so forth right
Off to the tele kid, you know my style
Cabby four points, rush street, magnificent mile
5”3  but 35, With the skin so soft
No no, keep on them vince komodos. But where that next gal gwan?
Open and take my third leg, Monique your girl wants to share
Burner to my back and ear, this was the moment I feared
So much for vibes.. huh?[Phife]
Dilla dawg, I had a dream about you fam
Its 2005, we in the same hospital room
You on one side, I'm on the other
I'm stressed out, but what gave motivation was you pullin' out that MP
And bangin out some bangers as usual
Nothin' ever phased you fam, and for that, I miss you

D-Town throw it up
NYC throw it up
The whole world throw it up
BK
[Verse 1: Phife]
Hold tight, this ain't the last time I see you
Due time, that's my word imma see you
Frontin ass rappers now here stealin' intros
Posin like they hard when we know they all see through
Imma tell you Dilla why they lackin skills now
No stage presence, cadence, style
They livin off of hooks, skinny jean crooks
Pre-K lyrics, Why would i need a book?
I Reminisce reminisce, when Mobb dropped shook
Shan was down by law, such a good look
Nas God's Son his return was Stillmatic
Distortion To Static, You and Slum Fantastic
Thought I'd chop you out son see how you're doin
Come back to earth homie, hip hop is in ruins
I'm a third of the Tribe but Imma speak for the click
What up though, we miss you kid
Motor city say

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Jay Dee flip another beat for me, Jay x4

[Verse 2: Phife]
Yo yo
Beatwise, you still that cat which most shit be measured
I'm that MC known to share his displeasure
With the route the game was taking, how mundane things have gotten
You know music on a whole, nevermind just hip hoppin
I'm in the club 3 hours and change
DJ spinnin Top 40, we be hearin all day
Some MCs are catalog, and yeah they stay paid
But why pay over one buck, when they lip synchin on stage?
King of pop, Barry White, rollin over in they grave
Jones Girls, Emotions singin Back in our Day
Dilla dude still crackin', they wish to be like you
Producer extraordinaires, knowing their beats be recycled
But on your worst day they couldn't mess with you
Cats makin Ts in remembrance of you
Least they could do is give your fam a dime or two
This man gave his heart, this what the fuck y'all do?
But yo don't stress my you, word bond we got you
Tell Baatin I said whats up, word he right next to you?
So NYC to the D with heavy hearts we miss you
Word God wish you were here, so until we meet again just

Hook

[Outro: Phife]
Ma dukes
V.Rich on the keys
My main my DJ Rasta Root on the beat, on the cuts
Smokin Needles, [?], salute
ATCQ forever(Yo, I'm checkin' for Left Eye man)
Oh God 'G', hm
I don't know God, I don't know God
I don't God, I don't really really know, check my flow...

[Phife Dawg]
My man Al B. Sure! "He's In Effect Mode"
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get wit me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Um, speakin' of which, you know how I troop
Late Thursday night playing ball at run and shoot
I see my girl Chilli in her Lexus Coupe
Sittin' pretty, oohh, in that hot pink suit
And BAM!! In through the door she struts
It's the lovely T-Boz with the ill haircut
(But Left Eye's the dime piece)
Yeah, you know it's all good
But I hear...it was a hood...
It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Phife from freak
It's like that y'all
My name's Malike the Phife from freak
It's on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E I rule
TLC up in the house, CrazySexyCool

Get on the microphone and just rip the track

Verse 1: Shaq
Who the hell is Shaq Attack you'd better read the paper
Treat me like Biz Markie you'd better catch a vapor
I've got mad props so why would you exploit
Punch you in your face like that kid from Detroit
Really yo you'd better ask MC Hammer 'bout this bad mama jama
Tall kid with the hoopa hypa lipta-gramma
Watch out yo it's time for MC bashin'
Got more loot than my man Johnny Cash and
I'm hard like a 360 twice jam
Ask Dr. Dre and Ed Lover who's the man
I'm sure they'll say me brother please don't play me like a shrimp
Dunk it on your head then I'll point like Shawn Kemp
Don't need the drink crooked I juice to get loose
My favorite cartoon is Bullwinkle the Moose
I'm 'bout to sting you like rubbing alcohol
Yes yes yall call me Ed Jones cause I'm too tall
Put the rhyme between my legs then I'll score
Never mind a whore I wanna do a phat tour
Come freak the style that the big Michelle display
You know the style that be my fortee

Hey yo I'm over here
Get on the microphone and rip a funky track

Verse 2: Phife
It's the Phife and Shaq mission plus Shaheed's got the goods
Making rough daddy jams knocking harder than wood
Make ya boogie with the fly armstrong crew
Phife Dawg and Shaq Fu this is how we do
Funky renditions there's no competiton
Split mc's apart as if their group was New Edition
Make mc's hush stop look and listen
It's hard to comprehed so they commence to remincising
Far from an amateur microhpone damager
End your whole career beat down your manager
Never was a herb kick you to the curb
There's more to my attitude than the city of Johanesburg
Styles are mean but this year they're even meaner
Carrying chips on my shoulder so call me Sarafina
Gaurantee Joey martin pissin' and a fartin'
Mess around with this and you'll be on a milk carton
Mc's don't like me I say tough titties
Blow up the spot like my man from Jersey City
People always askin' 'why is Phife so cocky?'
I gotta be good at something cause I can't play hockey
You know the status and the status is live
The first draft-pick for the label called Jive

Yo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at
Phife, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife Dawg, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
You can't front on the track cause the track is phat

Verse 3: Shaq
Yo here I am again you'd better call the cops
Pump up your Reeboks and ya just don't stop
I got mad styles you better sit and watch
I can kick it like he-he then I'll grab my crotch
Yo it's 1993 I mean nineteem-ninety-Shaq
Whatever year it is the Shaq will never slack
Giving mad shouts to my homeys up in Newark
On and off the court you know I do work

Verse 4: Phife
Peace to that dog and peace to this dog
Here comes the Phife Dawg aka the top dog
World's greatest 5-footer as if you didn't know
Rhymes are like the Lord's lessons they constantly flow
Mc's need to step on you see it is to ???
As long as the mic's on that's when I get my run on
Battle anybody come bring your whole crew
You want the short black eskimo come see me in my igloo
Nasty like vomit couldn't clean it with comet
Psycho like the Lords crazy like Onyx
Forget the hes and shes and concentrate just on the flow
Phife Dawg sigining off enjoy the rest of the show

Yo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here/ yo Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here/ Big Shaq, where ya at?

Verse 1 (Phife Dawg)
Everytime yuh see mi licked mushitup dancehall
Mc’s big or small, mi nuh afraid it dem all
The boyz, dem are jealous cuz see how I’m rock
I try comb voice to represent non’stop
Idiot bwoy, idiot bwoy, idiot bwoy step to side
And in enough room, feature all in my ride
Is a…
First come, first serve bases
Coolin’ out girl, I take you to the def places
I one of the kind, for you people the like
Plus, the shorty, his name Phife and I’m wreckin’ the mike
One time for you mind, and I’m chillin with notch
And, when they comes with rhymes, yo, I got mad styles
Six years in the game, and ain’t damn things change
???Set the warning, watch so many mc’s, they sounded on ring???
Manufact, too many mc’s they sounded on lie
To the point what you think, and they possessed to say mine
Same ?mazen?, gun took on, blunt smokin’, hoes smackin’
You see they just be append
And say hey jack when maybe rappin
But you may say: who the hell you there talk?
Punk  shorty from New-York, you have ?find ass?, better walk
But you no better than nigga fresh with those lips
Nuff crew, or no crew, I sink you whole fuckin’ battleship

Yo, it's Mutty Ranks in the place (Mutty Rankin')
But in the immortal words of Shabba Ranks (Where are the girls?)
We got some sweet, we got some foul
I'm about to break it down, check it out, let me know

Are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!) Do you like it like this?
Are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!) Do you like it like this?
Are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!) Do you like it like this?
Are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!)

Yo, as I cruise through this ATL town, my eyes brown
Chillin', freshly dipped when I get down
Jarobi, tell 'em 'bout the puppy named Mutts
Like lifestyles galore in case a chick wanna hump me
I'm rough with mine, tell me who's rougher
Makin' honeys express theyself like Salt-N-Pepa
Not sayin' that sex makes everything better
But if all else fails, I'mma fuck that tail
Now watch out now, damn look at your trunk
We could take it to the rest right now and get it crunk
Sing "Shorty Swing It My Way", it's only right
Turn the door, now walk it in and see the real sign of life
Fuck a Phife, I'm on some Shawn Micheal shit tonight
On some Five Foot Freak shit, or I don't eat shit
But if you act right and you ain't about games
Then my screwin' can be longer than Nina's last name
Now tell me somethin' good before I hang up your friend
Free humps and I'm out there if the shit is mad lame
Mad lame (mad lame) mad lame (mad lame)
Free humps and I'm out there if the shit is mad lame

When it comes to skins ain't no shame on my game
Mutty orders you to (BEND OVER!)
You can't live with them, you just can't live with them
So don't waste my time, just (BEND OVER!)
Now if you frontin' on the tail, then you get the cold shoulder
Diggy orders you to (BEND OVER!)
Girl, you are not gettin' younger, you are just gettin' older
So hurry up your ass and (BEND OVER!)
BEYATCH!

Are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!) Do you like it like this?
Now are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!) Do you like it like this?
Are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!) Do you like it like this?
Now are you ready? (WHAT!) Are you ready for this?
Do you like it? (WHAT!)

Forever in the jam where the diss be lookin' laced
Dancin' to the tunes of Cool J and Babyface
Me and my crew, no doubt we in the place
Ass everywhere, (Yeah son, this place is great)
Bumped into this cutie, damn boo you lookin' straight
Checked her backyard, can I guard that with a gate?
Slim trim, brown skin, what's your name? ('Salina Kate')
Where you from? ('Trinidad, but I live here in the States')
'It's only been three months but I'm searching for a mate
Word 'round town is you love to penetrate'
Of coarse, baby girl, what's the deal, you want a taste?
A stain is on your brain that could never be erased
'Sounds good Mr. Phifer, but I hear that's the case
Your style be so super that you should wear a cape
I love the way you sound on all five of your tapes
Plus you're always on the job like Mr. Slate'
Of coarse her best friend just has to player hate
And being who I am watch the Phifey hesitate
On dissing her ass, yo Jay, look at her face
Her motherfuckin' voice got way too much bass
Now back your ass up off me and give me my space
You know your fuckin' breath smell like chemical waste
Not to mention that ass, it be way overweight
Keep that ass out of Wendy's and lay off them shakes
Now back to you Salina, damn I admire your shape
'FUCK YOU! Mr. Ranks you just dissed my date'
Now what I'm supposed, scratch my head and ask why
You know that rug munchin's at an all-time high
Now all these chicks today are just hot hot hot
And me and my crew just wanna get hind, watch
I won't hold it against you the things that you do
I'll just have you know that I'm a lesbian too
So wiggle your ass here and swing over them titties
If you need to pay bills take your ass to Magic City
No need to act shitty, you're so so saditty
If you need to pay bills then take your ass to Magic City, what what

All you're lookin' for all this time, money
Well ain't got enough time to take
You can't run game on a gamer!
You can't run game on a gamer!
It's Phife Diggy (What) I gets busy (What)
Blowin' up the spot (What) Givin' back shots (Ooh! Ooh!)
J.U.S. (What) You know you can't test (What)
Blowin' up the spot (What) Givin' back shots (Ooh! Ooh!)

When it comes to skins ain't no shame on my game
Mutty orders you to (BEND OVER!)
I'll fuck in a Land Cruiser or a Range Rover
Diggy orders you to (BEND OVER!)
Now if you frontin' with your ass, then you get the cold shoulder
Diggy orders you to (BEND OVER!)
You are not gettin' younger, you are just gettin' older
So hurry up your ass and (BEND OVER!)

Like that y'all, to the beat y'all
Freak freak y'all, so sweat y'all
My name's Malik y'all, style's unique y'all
No doubt y'all, I come through y'all
Tribe all y'all. Phife Diggy y'all
On the ball y'all
And all these bitches on the way get the balls y'all
Phife Diggy but I never fall out
Slum Villy, got to bend over
What what what what, all over
Detroit Michigan, down in Angeles in CA
Fuck that we don't play round my way
Long Island, we whilin'
Yugoslavia, no doubt I'm Slav-in' 'em[Phife]
Dilla dawg, I had a dream about you fam
Its 2005, we in the same hospital room
You on one side, I'm on the other
I'm stressed out, but what gave motivation was you pullin' out that MP
And bangin out some bangers as usual
Nothin' ever phased you fam, and for that, I miss you

D-Town throw it up
NYC throw it up
The whole world throw it up
BK
[Verse 1: Phife]
Hold tight, this ain't the last time I see you
Due time, that's my word imma see you
Frontin ass rappers now here stealin' intros
Posin like they hard when we know they all see through
Imma tell you Dilla why they lackin skills now
No stage presence, cadence, style
They livin off of hooks, skinny jean crooks
Pre-K lyrics, Why would i need a book?
I Reminisce reminisce, when Mobb dropped shook
Shan was down by law, such a good look
Nas God's Son his return was Stillmatic
Distortion To Static, You and Slum Fantastic
Thought I'd chop you out son see how you're doin
Come back to earth homie, hip hop is in ruins
I'm a third of the Tribe but Imma speak for the click
What up though, we miss you kid
Motor city say

[Hook: Q-Tip]
Jay Dee flip another beat for me, Jay x4

[Verse 2: Phife]
Yo yo
Beatwise, you still that cat which most shit be measured
I'm that MC known to share his displeasure
With the route the game was taking, how mundane things have gotten
You know music on a whole, nevermind just hip hoppin
I'm in the club 3 hours and change
DJ spinnin Top 40, we be hearin all day
Some MCs are catalog, and yeah they stay paid
But why pay over one buck, when they lip synchin on stage?
King of pop, Barry White, rollin over in they grave
Jones Girls, Emotions singin Back in our Day
Dilla dude still crackin', they wish to be like you
Producer extraordinaires, knowing their beats be recycled
But on your worst day they couldn't mess with you
Cats makin Ts in remembrance of you
Least they could do is give your fam a dime or two
This man gave his heart, this what the fuck y'all do?
But yo don't stress my you, word bond we got you
Tell Baatin I said whats up, word he right next to you?
So NYC to the D with heavy hearts we miss you
Word God wish you were here, so until we meet again just

Hook

[Outro: Phife]
Ma dukes
V.Rich on the keys
My main my DJ Rasta Root on the beat, on the cuts
Smokin Needles, [?], salute
ATCQ forever[Phife Dawg]
When folks say they want some raw hip hop, guess who they quick to call?
Diggy Dawg, cuz my shit be neanderthal
Some call it primitive, retaining to an earlier time
Can't help but go back to them years like '89
When brothers gave a damn about the beats and rhymes
Now life is only by the party, ices worn by everybody
But what are you saying lyrically, come on, seriously
See that's what's wrong with this muthafucking industry
MC's be listening to they A&R friends
But they ain't your friends, they ain't into setting no trends
It's all about them, and how you can make them some ends
But fuck that, I'm here to make sure that skills transcend
Where there's a, pad and pen, Phife gon' make 'em some yen
With Mr. Fudge on his job, Hi-Tek on the blend
Wifey holding me down, granny singing me hymns
Urging me to praise God and keep my eyes on him
Just to look is at, see him, he's a mimic to me
Simply put things in perspective, on how to MC
And be an all I can be, done deal, and that's real
Phife the baby face of hip hop, with the raw whip appeal

[Hook: Phife Dawg (Hi-Tek)]
I'm here to do what I can do, and I'm done with that
(Yo, fuck that, this where the realness at)
I know you fraud ass rappers can't attest to that
(Yo, fuck that, this where the realness at)
Real rap's aim at the wig, while rest fake jack
(Yo, fuck that, that's where the realness at)

"The realness"
"And that's my word"
"Queens"
"Into that"

[Hook 2x: Phife Dawg]
One-time for your mind, this is how we do
Phife Dawg rock gems, Hi-Tek produce
And it don't stop, we got the sure shot
It's for the, it's for the, better men of hip hop

[Phife Dawg]
So you wanna be that superstar, but you more like nova
Shining for a week, by next Monday you're over
Anytime you see a mic, better look over your shoulder
BOW! Before you get smacked with the boulder
Thought my attitude was cold for you G? It's even colder
Bitter, MC's get kicked right in they shitter
Mut' Ranks, more controversial than Adolf Hitler
Test me, you getting cut with this here log splitter
Now who's iller, backs get snapped like Tostitos tortillas
My shit be killa dealer, Planet of the Apes, fuck a Magilla
Feel me, black, to Queens, New York, where y'all at?
Lick two shots out in the air, front front to back
Too many rappers running round, fronting like they the bomb
Or you hardly to be the first to read the 23rd psalm
Did you think you'd just get over, with the looks and charm
Or did you, study the style that the next was on?
Come on? Time's up for the fraudulent, peep the style that I implement
I'm say, God damn I'm so innocent
Shit's just so critical, niggas don't wanna hear the lyrical
And they wonder why this rap game's so God damn fickle
Peep the fake shit that the wack suburban rapper be on
One or two rappers from the projects they might sing love songs
Tell me, is something wrong? Damn, right, niggas ain't tight
And they won't be tomorrow, next Never-uary, and damn sure not tonight
You wanna know why? Cuz Diggy Dawg is in they eye sight
You wanna know why? Cuz Phife Dawg is in they eye sight

[Hook]

[Hook 4x]One time, yo

Yo, you know what?
I might not always say the right thing
But I say what the fuck I feel
On the real
What the deal

Knawmean?
World's greatest five-footer back up in yo shit
Check it
Let me ask you

[Verse 1]
Who these cats, lookin punanny-ish?
For those who don't understand: that's some vagina shit
I think I'm lost, yo, tell me what you're dealin with?
Niggas' rhymes be watered down like porn star clitoris
It's so ridiculous, you're soundin hideous
Talkin tough, but be dressin on some wussy shit
Tight see-through shirt, on some hard nipple shit
Fake Versace shades while all up in the club and shit
Fake Rolex, it'll change the color of your arm and shit
Sports bras, halter tops, what the fuck is this?
Dudes be brought up just to sell some records? SHIT
Then wanna be voice of the streets, you see this bullshit?
Wait - if you gon' half-step in hip-hop, you need to stop
This here remains in the street, play puss, you're gettin fucked
Go 'head, play yourself with them ho-like hooks
Sing ballads if it's all about the Maxwell look
Mack make-up with a pair of [brand name] thinkin you're cute
Fubu suit with Steve Madden boots make me wanna puke
Phat Farm shorts with a garder belt, lookin like a whore
Or a purple bandana cause it matches your shaw?
Now tell me, what you rhymin for?
This shit is all about flows, fuck a fashion show
Hip-Hop 101, Professor Diggy, yo
And if you want it laid back, call Kenny Lattimore
No disrespect to these men, cause I like R&B
But right here in my class we gonnna emcee
It's all about the zhigge-zhigge, yeah, the scratch 'n cut
Graffiti art, jammin in the park, holdin your nuts
Muthafuckas, I am hip-hop, I walk hip-hop, I talk hip-hop
I need hip-hop, I lust hip-hop, I love hip-hop
B-Boy round the clock, doin it non-stop

[Hook]
Flawless
Diggy gon' hit you with the rawness
Pass me the mic and I'mma scorch it
And when mi done with it, mi just toss it
But never force it
My shit is flawless
Mutty Ranks hit you with the rawness
Pass me the mic and I'mma scorch it
And when mi done with it, mi just toss it
But never force it

[Verse 2]
Peep the Groove Attack ensemble, we about to fly high
Fuck majors, we independent like the 4th of July (Why?)
I guess we didn't really share the same vision
But it was their decision
Them fuckers just wouldn't listen
But now look who's bitchin
While Phifey cuts with precision
It's my ass they're kissin
Don't worry 'bout what I'm shippin
As for Jive, I know they hate on how I blow up the spot
How quickly they forget what got they ass to the top
What they figure, I bust my ass to feed they dirty-ass kids?
Get the fuck out of here, fuck am I, Britney Spears?
These cats'll turn you against your brethren if you let em, and how
It's the reason me and my former partner don't talk now
Communication is the key, capital word be unity
These folks will guide you to your grave, then come and read the eulogy
Independent like Philly, majors can't do shit for me but suck mi toe
Go find a MC with some half-assed flow
But I understand these styles, they just quickly endin now
Forever wantin to play games, but guess what, I'm not a child
For the new breed of MC's: learn to own your shit, gee
Stay black, keep it real, purchase at [Name]
Fuck a waiting to exhale, Malik is at once released
While all you so-called CEO's and A&R's get impeached
Say Fudge - you shoulda never let me off the damn leash

Ha-ha
Arrrf!
Now break it down now
I am hip-hop, I sleep hip-hop, I want hip-hop
I love hip-hop, I lust hip-hop, I need hip-hop
B-Boy round the clock, doin it non-stop

And I'm
Flawless
Diggy gon' hit you with the rawness(Yo, I'm checkin' for Left Eye man)
Oh God 'G', hm
I don't know God, I don't know God
I don't God, I don't really really know, check my flow...

[Phife Dawg]
My man Al B. Sure! "He's In Effect Mode"
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get wit me
But just in case I own more condoms than TLC
Um, speakin' of which, you know how I troop
Late Thursday night playing ball at run and shoot
I see my girl Chilli in her Lexus Coupe
Sittin' pretty, oohh, in that hot pink suit
And BAM!! In through the door she struts
It's the lovely T-Boz with the ill haircut
(But Left Eye's the dime piece)
Yeah, you know it's all good
But I hear...it was a hood...
It's like that y'all
My name's Malik the Phife from freak
It's like that y'all
My name's Malike the Phife from freak
It's on the M-I-C-R-O-P-H-O-N-E I rule
TLC up in the house, CrazySexyCool

YouknowwhaImsayin?
Ya know what I'm sayin'Yes, ha ha ha
Oh boy, it's big trouble in the place
I'm in the place, I'm in the place, I'm in the place
I'm in the place, I'm in the mash hall place

Just when you thought you was nice
In comes the rude boy that they call Phife
Since the year '89, I've been around the world twice
And I everywhere, I go they say the same shit: (that kid is nice)
Gotta give a shout-out to my everyday peeps
The ones who knew the time, the ones who never did sleep
'89 twas the year when I entered the game
Nobody knew my face, nobody knew my name
But I knew from day one that this here wasn't games
Gots to do this cause I love this, so mother fuck the fame
Gotta represent with the correct mindframe
Since the day that De La put me on, hip-hop has never been the same
My eyebrows stiffed when 'Tip and Sha' said "kick a rhyme"
I simply go for broke, because I'm no joke
I learned to freestyle early because I couldn't afford a pencil
Or better yet a dime that I could lend to Mr. Wendall
Alot of emcees talk, say they pushed the tech out
They figured I'd lose my touch, just because I'm down south
But you know good and well that Malik ain't havin' that
I could live in fuckin' Greese, still in all, I won't slack
I'm sayin' though, my brother, you know there ain't no other
So tell your main bitch that the Malik is still a lover
Got that rough daddy flow, my idol's Michealangelo
Enviro means I'm gettin' paid, cause my Eli said so
I drop you emcees in a line like that game of dominoes
So here we go, here we go, here we go
Yes, see in the east we get biz
Unh, Phife Diggy is the man kid, whoomp there it is
That's to give a shout to Walt, since '87, he's had my back
Pa dukes, ma dukes, my little brother named Zack
My main purpose in life, is to be no one but Phife
Just when you thought you was nice, now break it down

Now if you think that I'm gonna be good to you
If you think that I got what you need
Shorty you're right
(bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippe yea
Phife Dawg's got somethin' for you baby)

Now I'm the type of emcee to toot my horn like Reno
Before I hit the stage I take a sip of aquafino
I used to date Sabirno, or better yet Selino
Who had more fuckin' lumps than half-cooked forino
You know my stee, the illy-illy emcee
Phife Diggy, still knockin' off fleas
Yo, plus how I bring it on the freestyle note
Fuck what you heard, my shit is capital 'D', dope
Yes indeed, I give you what you need
You try to test me, you're smokin' too much weed
Yo, watch now how we bring it, and everybody sing it
And like Mint Condition, no doubt, we fuckin' swingin'

Ha, it's like that yo, check the flow yo
Ha, word up, word up
Yeah, now break it down
Ha, Jay Dee throw it down
Detroit status, what, we is the baddest, what
New York status, what, we is the baddest, unh
Chicago status, what, we is the baddest, unh
Saint Louis stats, what, we is the baddest, what
H-O-U, stand for Houston
ATL, you know what you did
It's like that y'all[Hook x4]
La Schmoove, yo we don't got nothing to prove

[Verse 1: Poc Fu]
Yo, when I was small they used to tease me
Because my hair was peasy, hard and greasy
But now I'm living well like George and Wheezy
So easy (WHAT) does it (YO)
Is it because I'm rocking -- beats, beats, beats
Fu-Manchu'n cause I'm doing what just had to be done
Now we in there like swimwear, girls calling me hon
Give me hugs, little peck, mucho tongue, lots of sex
Nuff respects to my bros that live on five-six street (RIGHT)
I'm smashing monster mashing boom bashing in a fashion
Which is wild now I smile when I whip-lash MC's with my style
Call me Cuckoo, I'm making buku bucks
I'm geared and fully prepared to tear all MC's that are schmuks
For bros who sleep and cavity creep and listen when I talk
As I soothe in the groove, cause I'm smooth like Mr. Rourke
Doobely-zoo Mr. Wu, no need to be rude but F.U
Cause I ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chip Fu]
Leave it to Beaver'-arriva, derci
Heavens to mercy ba FU sayanora
Adios muchachos dorme vous unbuckle my Fu-Schnick shoe
Mr. Chip Fu, about to wreck shop
With the Judo (CHOP) a Judo (CHOP) a Judo chop (CHOP)
Yo zilch kaput me nada none son
I don't think so, so take a look at
A Superfly big Jimmy the Honeynut Cheerio Bee
Ba schnicker bah snchnucker
I ams what I ams that's all what I ams
My lyrics are never done
I'm the big John Elmer Glue the Elmer the Fudd
Al Bundy the Bud Light stud
Come like tongues lashes, with the quickness
Moc and Poc is, my witness
Ask the Kung about my tongue and the styles that I brung instead
I'm the Ali Babi cutty rankin shuba-dib-da-dabble
Jaw Boy Wonder Bread dread, BUM BA READ
These lyrics ah-come out of mi head, BUM BA READ
Mr. Chip Fu's gon stay' di-di, da-di-di, dra-dread
You said I couldn't rap, but I really wrecked shop
And I don't stop drop, I get props
I pick up the mic drop a style and pattern and fashion
And all MC's jaws drops down
My accent, you're mocking my clothes, you're clocking
Ripping MC's to smithereens to their
Ribbidy-diddiby-Pippi Long-STOCKINGS
So don't step to Chip, I'm on the La Schmoove tip
You'll say Drats I really failed again plus he sank my Babble-ship
So oooh, shit G, wa-wa or biscuit
Rip it and be specific doin it terrific when I kicks it
Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang, Pepe LePew, Pepe LePew
La Schmoove, yo I ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Now here I go, once again with the ill flow
Other MC's that rap, their style is so-so
Phife Dawg was never the type that ever lacked skills
I just stay true to my roots and then I get ill
Twenty years of age but yet I still see (KNOWLEDGE)
And this year, was so-called, my Senior year in (COLLEGE)
But I chose to pursue, in a field called music
And with some hype beats and breaks you know I won't refuse it
Get on the board lay down the track and I'll do ten laps
Pass the pen, pass the pad, and I'll kick nuff (RAPS)
Just come inside your jam and witness who is boss
And it won't be Tony Danza nor Diana Ross
As small as I am, I still can pack jams
Do a freestyle and step, but yet I still slam
Not trying to say that no one can get with me
Not only is it the lyrics I write, it's my delivery
Name one rapper that you know who has this high-strung voice
My name's Malik and I'm unique, in other words top choice
Nothing commercial bout this, it's mainly hardcore
Now that you got what you want, do you want more
Because I got more in store

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Moc Fu]
MC, the Shining One, a.k.a. The Golden Child
I have a grin at times but then throw up a fake smile
Vaseline Intensive Care, don't fear mon frere
Sak Pase, everybody that rappin, G pull his hair
Back in the groove, it's no way you can handle this
Shit so fly, that you can call it scandalous
Cause I mani-fest in, words that I'm preaching
Unleashing you now seek the sounds that I'm teaching
I hear (NOT) see (NOT), knots to makes butts (ROCK)
I rides rhythm to the beginnin, then won't stop
The Chinese Son of Sam, the Skipper's Peter Pan
The rootinest tootinest cowboy in the East
Releasing a new type of lyrical lingo
Single, +The Alarm+, the girls cooties I will tingle
No expiration date, so you know I won't (EXPIRE)
No skippin a weekly check, so I don't have to (RETIRE)
Write, the ca-pital, M.O
Chip Fu with the Kung-Fu givin shouts on my show
Ir-regular styles is here too
Tripped, boo-boo, you first made a mistake
Not Alexander but considered to be Great
Great, but, like the Grape Ape
Fake, the moves, and your ankles I will break
Break, or broken, the M.O., has spoken
Movements on the slick, taking the train you need a token
I guess not, cause you pause for the cause
You either biting your nails, or start picking straws
Holy Mick I'm living large just like trunk jewels
Nuff respects to many minds, Ah-OWWWWWWWWWWWEE

[Hook][Dres]
Yo! One for your mother, two for your pops
Three's for the niggas that's trying to kill the cops
So whether the Black Sheep are here, with the corner for the car
D-R-E-S so yes I guess it back and watch the Dres get raw
In transition, a pubic hair I can't stand
I tell your momma "I love you" if you thought my style was missing
My Snoopy, Droopy, Casper, a punky
You're rolling with Dres, the Black Sheep, that says my brother's freaking
Funky
I know you want to test me, but but but please don't try to sub me
Cause when but forever you get to snuff me
Beretta to your head and yo you'd better be on your jet ski
I could never be The Ruler but like Rick I say I'm slick
You're just a backwards kid, excuse me I meant to say a dik
So now you got beef and broccoli or is it cockolli?
But we got time, we keep 18, or yet two nines
So let the horns blow cause you know that you're just a barking dog
Bluff all along, prince now a frog
Don't play post, because we both know you're kellogs

[Dove]
I be the drama so watch the Wonderama
Catch a dips hips sweeter when I call her "mamacita"
Not a lover, a fighter, no need to loving these see
Didn't like the Brady Bunch, for many years I had a hunch
Living like the Givens, big thanks for big banks
I'm sticking like a dish swordfish when I shanks
Maximum is maximized, minimum is none
You want to shoot the breeze, please, pass the peas my pig is done
Not the vigilant, or walk with a slant
Want to hit the "Yes I Can Can" and never say I can't
I wear the Neil Diamonds and fucks what Simon says
Had to freaks the fat so I cuts some from my dread
But back, again they come, just a little sooner to
Become one nation under the groove
Oh I feel the Clinton, soothing me like Lipton
Tea, and it's definitely under the groove
I'm feeling kind of hot but like my man Rowdy Piper
Raining with the raps so hit the window wiper
Tired of y'all brothers going from a cipher
Don't baby sip the bottle or I hit you with the diaper
Never toke or smoke, I don't even own a lighter
If it's any pipe I'm lighting, it's the pipe that goes inside of her
Check the ??? boy as I ride or break time from the rhyme
Cause I'm back and out of sight of

[Fashion]
Snort up a kilo, better sex than Rio
Fashion, Ju, and Les, I make a third of the trio
Fiddly fi, fiddly fy, fiddly fo, fiddly fum
I smell props, hit 'em hard, and then I cum
Love to eat a skin, but first I inspect it
Not a crim-im-im-inal, got a record, go and check it
Or you can get ate up, pass me a plate of
A little seafood, I find a phone and ring a date up
So never start a track without Beatnuts on the list
Brothers buck shots from point blank and still miss
Middly miss, middly miss, why would I ever diss?
Fiddle or fight or peace and for for it fists
Ayo Huggy Bear, do your manager, do your damage
I'll let you tell the story but first get you a bandage
Cause you can go for MILES and MILES and MILES and
Talk more tracks than the dog doo doo piles and
Kennel, I say when'll, or when he stop
Let me see your girl and better believe those drawers will drop
It's getting freaky, a Beatnut thing that is
Let the horns blow because that's what time it is

[Phife]
Yo! Doggy doggy jivin', guess who's next?
The 5 foot assassin with the microphone check
I'm all that and more cause there never was comp
Play Mr. Bad and you shall get stomped
I had a head full of hair, but I kept all my rhymes
A brother from Queens and yo I always gets mines
No shorts are being taken, no not this year
The Phife Dawg is here so you'd better beware
Concieted? I guess it's something like that
Cause God don't make no jokes so I know I ain't wack
So relax and chill, sit your booty still
Or just take loss like the Buffalo Bills
But when I'm called the Phifer, how many times have you heard that?
Suckers walk around talking bout they can burn that
Soft MC, he can't be talking to me
Cause I'm far from a wuss and I never was a puss
I grab the mic, MC's start to get petrol
Cause there's no MC like Phife, like those who fight progresso
Open your back, not give you no slack, see what I'm saying son?
There more to this here than being short, dark, and handsome
Messing with my lady, you know that's a no-no
Why? Because you can't mess with my Yo-Yo
You know that I'm the one, you know that I'm the boss
I'm in there (Like the Dove?) No, like Franco ?Source?

[Chi-Ali]
Well it's me Chi-Ali and I'm the last to spark, yo
Everywhere I go I get stalked by NARC
And TNT just can't understand
You see a brother with gear, a beeper, and in his pocket a grand
But enough of that, let me break it down
We are all black brothers on a quest, yes we do have soul
Some of us are hoein', some are on the positive road
Me, I'm hoein', on the mic I'm flowing
With the tongue and we are positively growing
Now when I'm in a battle, I just be having fun
But competition be so scared that they be whitling come
Now ou heard me flow to a nice tempo so, let the horns blow[Busta Rhymes]
Here in 1992 we present
The fabulous What's The Scenario remix
Whereas there are seven MC's
Six which are in physical form and one which is in spiritual essence
And he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!

[Kid Hood]
Check the vibe, walk that ass or get got
F it (shit) I lick buckshots
Hood, madman, I rip up stages
Lay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis
Extra, extra, pick up a clip
I'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)
I'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs
I'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty
I baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news
I'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews
Death on the phono, my skills are porno
You say "oh no," you bitch ass homo
I bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time
I slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time
Sick ass brother, nasty ass nigga
Pump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river
Two tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can
(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man

[Phife Dawg]
Quick is how I flip from the tip of the lip
Punchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips
The five-foot assassin has just raided your area
Your booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya
(So!) Roll out the red carpet cause I'm kickin' this
Vanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous
Excuse my French, but profanity is all I knew
And to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too
And let it be known, I'm not the one to step to
You're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue
Freestyle fanatic, probably the best around
As for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down
The Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop
The five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop
So do like Michael Jackson and "Remember the Time" (Do you remember?)
Put on your dancin' shoes or somethin cause you sure can't rhyme

[Cut Monitor Milo]
(Big up, big up!) Enter new identity
Next to say something cause you pass it to me
What does it take to check a technique?
(Many styles, many styles!)
Hostile heat, brings bursts of energy
Milo in De Dance is the new identity
One two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect
Ten to one that I come (Correct!)
In my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots
So I can grow dreadlocks
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Maintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)
Kicking right inna your what's it not
I could rock longer but fair is fair
So C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)
C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)

[Charlie Brown]
Makin moves y'all (Moves y'all!) On and on and on
(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn
(Who's that?!) just one of the L.O.N.S
And a Tribe Called Quest (East coast) to West
Remix mad kick, more than Metallica
To all MCs fall like the Battlestar Galactica
Stampin', stompin', rompin' Compton
(People all over the world!) I'm promptin (Style!)
Pick a style, any style, Strong Isle
Representation, sensationalization
"Scenario" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so
(Here we go yo!) Yeah
Force, Main Source LP on the rise
In living color we'll see seen through original eyes
And I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh
(Ooh ahh, ooh ahh!) There it is baby pah

[Dinco D]
Flying in on a limb, slim trim, D I am
There I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim
Sight we be right, be polite for my mics
Like I'm like (See sick, see syke)
And slip away, and off to the Poconos
Spot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose
Yamaha (Ay-Ha May!)
Let's split the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)
Enough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it
If I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it
Cause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys
Bed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest
Male, not female, hail from Uniondale
Bounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled
In the hallways always ringing with a (Ho!)
This one two times nine on the Scenario

[Q-Tip]
Check it out everybody, rhymes and mics
Black Benz gettin looped (Doin' what they like!)
Eight black brothers in the public eye
If you listen very close, I will tell you why
(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown
Shaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down
Will commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)
In-terrogation for the knockin of the box
The boom-box ruler, controls the medulla
None come cooler, I win like Shula
So bust out the moves as you start to pursue her
Intensified mind, nine-blunt consumer
Tip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)
The meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)
Peace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner
Smoke 'em up later, if not then sooner

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey what we gon do (Dooo) in '92
Even though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91
Wonderful my days, herb dream comin' down
Ponna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground
What's goin on my man? (Goddamn!) And now my brain is hurtin'
Listen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em
Rip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em
Open up your mouth if you want the food
To get rude, Flipmode, cause I'm in the mood
Ah-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes
Body drippin with blood comin out your nose
Give me a Band-Aid, what are you askin for?
(More!) Only your sacred and pure
Adverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap
Rap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes
Yeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my roach spray (Anyway!)
Ding-A-Ling, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School
Mad brother when stealthy RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!
To my dragon, baby, stop whinin' I see my influence still shinin'
More crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo
That's the Scenario![Intro Cj Fly]
I'm feeling the energy inside the room tonight
The tunes are nice, hey girlfriend ah you mi like [x4]

[Verse 1 Cj Fly]
We just happened to as meet in the club
I was there reading vibes, she was cheesing so much
Put my seeds on her buns
Feel it in her guts, anytime she take a crunch
Tried to take my spread when I seen her for lunch
The number I think she wanted when she ate
Driven going the distance with a couple different place
Overall they over shaped, had them digging in the crates
Got my chicks by the dozen, six that I done did
Became so redundant, used to front but now they want me
Find that shit so funny
My only prob with cam, is she loves to use a cam, posting pics on Instagram
Caption say she with her man
My only prob with sharon, is she do way too much sharing
It's apparent she don't care about her appearance
With her parents, looking for a baller with a bigger hoop earrings
It's all def true it must be F'ing up her hearing
If Emma leave then I go fuck with Emily
Or probably Bethany she live down in Beverly
You invite her to the crib then she'll probably never leave
Everyone had a turn, name rings bells on every street
The girls that I like, set goals in their life
Wannabe known as a wife not a ho for the night
Got this girls number, didn't know what to write
I Guess she wasn't my type

[Hook]
I'm feeling the energy inside the room tonight
The tunes are nice, hey girlfriend ah you mi like [x4]

[Verse 2 A la Sole]
She wanna go get me now cause my team in the spotlight
She better be going down like she plumbing on the cockpipe
We at the top flight, without an elevator button
If I'm good for anything,you know I'm good for nothing
I roll the sumption then she come and try to puff it
I get up in her guts,no dutch but I stuff it
She cause a ruckus, when we fucking cause she love it
She never want to leave I wear her out like my bucket
We chilling like a villain, your chick a super ho
And I'm iron man I'm sticking ironing
But she can't leave the kid cause she used to pros
So don't fight it then just invite a friend
Like who am I to judge shawty preferences
Girl I steady turn heads like an exorcist
Straight exing chicks who are classy but they ashy
I know to take a L like a chair when they pass me

[During Hook]
[CJ Fly]
Yo phife it's fly what's good?

[Verse 3 Phife Dawg]
Okay I feel the energy inside the room no doubt
All eyes on me as if 2Pac touched down
New Year's Eve, Chitown favorite city (Word up)
Maceo from dela spinning, got the shrine turnt up
Pro era was performing, hey they ain’t no joke
Ooo, two mami’s in the [?], with that good ass smoke
Marisol from southside, Monique from hyde park
Just my luck, one likes them short, the other likes them dark
They mentioned they would love to start the New Year right
Love the fact that 3-1-2 chicks be so forth right
Off to the tele kid, you know my style
Cabby four points, rush street, magnificent mile
5”3  but 35, With the skin so soft
No no, keep on them vince komodos. But where that next gal gwan?
Open and take my third leg, Monique your girl wants to share
Burner to my back and ear, this was the moment I feared
So much for vibes.. huh?[Announcer]
Still not convinced about Ghost Weed?

But right now I'm 'bout to show you Phife, you heard me?
Alright here we go
You know what just, somebody hit the beat
*****

[Phife]
L-Y-R to the I-C-S
Niggas still fussin' 'bout who be the best
When Diggy Dog bounce through I put all that to rest ..
.. anyone try test I put two in they chest
Quest or no Quest I leave venue's a mess
Don't ask me to colab', me and you don't mesh
I stay fresh from the fresh, never frontin' or fess
In the name of J Christ all mics'll get blessed
Peep how I posess flavor, style, finesse
Microphones, honeys, two things I caress
To all you fake jiggy niggas, still not impressed
Queens, I rep' it to the fully, you'd think I own the Mets

*****
What, know I'm Phife, Phife nigga, what
You know how I know you ain't Phife?
You'da said you own the Knicks or somethin'
Listen man I'm sayin', it's sports it's what I'm just doin'
I'm sayin', it don't matter, that's not the point
That shit is wack, impostor yo
I sound like PhifeYo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Yo yo, I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here

Yo yo, I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife Dawg, I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Get on the microphone and just rip the track

Verse 1: Shaq
Who the hell is Shaq Attack you'd better read the paper
Treat me like Biz Markie you'd better catch a vapor
I've got mad props so why would you exploit
Punch you in your face like that kid from Detroit
Really yo you'd better ask MC Hammer 'bout this bad mama jama
Tall kid with the hoopa hypa lipta-gramma
Watch out yo it's time for MC bashin'
Got more loot than my man Johnny Cash and
I'm hard like a 360 twice jam
Ask Dr. Dre and Ed Lover who's the man
I'm sure they'll say me brother please don't play me like a shrimp
Dunk it on your head then I'll point like Shawn Kemp
Don't need the drink crooked I juice to get loose
My favorite cartoon is Bullwinkle the Moose
I'm 'bout to sting you like rubbing alcohol
Yes yes yall call me Ed Jones cause I'm too tall
Put the rhyme between my legs then I'll score
Never mind a whore I wanna do a phat tour
Come freak the style that the big Michelle display
You know the style that be my fortee

Hey Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here
Hey Phife, where ya at?
Hey yo I'm over here

Phife Dawg is over here
Yo Phife, where ya at?
Hey yo I'm over here
Get on the microphone and rip a funky track

Verse 2: Phife
It's the Phife and Shaq mission plus Shaheed's got the goods
Making rough daddy jams knocking harder than wood
Make ya boogie with the fly armstrong crew
Phife Dawg and Shaq Fu this is how we do
Funky renditions there's no competiton
Split mc's apart as if their group was New Edition
Make mc's hush stop look and listen
It's hard to comprehed so they commence to remincising
Far from an amateur microhpone damager
End your whole career beat down your manager
Never was a herb kick you to the curb
There's more to my attitude than the city of Johanesburg
Styles are mean but this year they're even meaner
Carrying chips on my shoulder so call me Sarafina
Gaurantee Joey martin pissin' and a fartin'
Mess around with this and you'll be on a milk carton
Mc's don't like me I say tough titties
Blow up the spot like my man from Jersey City
People always askin' 'why is Phife so cocky?'
I gotta be good at something cause I can't play hockey
You know the status and the status is live
The first draft-pick for the label called Jive

Yo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at
Phife, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife Dawg, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
You can't front on the track cause the track is phat

Verse 3: Shaq
Yo here I am again you'd better call the cops
Pump up your Reeboks and ya just don't stop
I got mad styles you better sit and watch
I can kick it like he-he then I'll grab my crotch
Yo it's 1993 I mean nineteem-ninety-Shaq
Whatever year it is the Shaq will never slack
Giving mad shouts to my homeys up in Newark
On and off the court you know I do work

Verse 4: Phife
Peace to that dog and peace to this dog
Here comes the Phife Dawg aka the top dog
World's greatest 5-footer as if you didn't know
Rhymes are like the Lord's lessons they constantly flow
Mc's need to step on you see it is to ???
As long as the mic's on that's when I get my run on
Battle anybody come bring your whole crew
You want the short black eskimo come see me in my igloo
Nasty like vomit couldn't clean it with comet
Psycho like the Lords crazy like Onyx
Forget the hes and shes and concentrate just on the flow
Phife Dawg sigining off enjoy the rest of the show

Yo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here/ yo Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here/ Big Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here/ yo Phife, where ya at?
I'm over here/ yo Shaq, where ya at?

He's over there/Big Chris, where ya at?
He's over there/Nick Ander, where ya at?
He's over there/yo check it out[Intro - Phife Dawg]
Lo, Bay, Snag, and Phife
This is how we hold it down every night
Aiyyo it's Lo, Bay, Snag, and Phife
Money in our pocket and our chicks is right
Aiyyo it's Lo, Bay, Snag, and Phife
This is how we hold it down every night
Aiyyo it's Lo, Bay, Snag, and Phife
Aiyyo, money in our pocket and our chicks is right

[Verse One - Big Lo]
There's a lot of niggas out there that spit that shit
And there's alot of motherfuckers that just talk shit
But a nigga like me, I got hundred percent G
To get a homeless nigga come and cop a tape off me
I do my thing with the flows, do my thing with the hoes
And my nigga Bay Lloyd keep a fresh pair of both
When it's time to rock raps you better be on your toes
It's Big Lo, I come through with the murderous rhymes
Man, Mike got shit but he ain't fuckin' with mine
Chick be like, yo who the fuck left the pussy open?
Feelin' fucked up in his skins while he strokin'
Mad cause a nigga like me left it open
I'm the cat on the low in the hood, who be creepin'
Catch me with a hot black chick or a Rican
If shorty blow the spot, fuck it we just won't be speakin'
But trust me she'll be back by the motherfuckin' weekend
Cause I stays on my toes when it comes to the freakin'
I kick the hot shit that keep my whole team eatin'

[ Verse Two - Bay Lloyd]
When it comes to rap, I got a arm like a quarterback
The nigga to but your daughter on the track, and sell her body
Not stressed for paper, there's more to rap
It's the fans, they like to see me pop bottles at every party
Got our band's website, for fiends to order crack
I'm the man of my hood, I thought I told you that, don't be nervous
You're worthless, BE ALL YOU CAN BE!
Y'all niggas better off joinin' the service
Don't hustle y'all baby (mama), why don't you sell garbage
Twelve-twelve fifty eighths, hear me take off like Curtis
Mayfield, and reach a nigga, stay still
Y'all niggas, don't you know can't fuck around with Bay's skills
Come in heavy like Durangos with thick soles
I'd rather hair stores sell weave to Kim Coles

[Hook 2x]
This here hold it down for Lynden, Bully like what!
Runnin' through life and not givin' a fuck
Gotta get your paper, never mind these sluts
They ain't goin' nowhere we can always get butt

[Verse Three - Snag]
Hit the record button Snag's about to floss logic, tape deck
I spit more classics then niggas been raised by poppin' acid
Now peep my tactics, flat on they back, without a mattress
When I go birdy, Snag in the Gucci casket
I brought platinum back, but it's only on the plastic
It's the fourth quarter, peep the Snag as he stretches
Y'all niggas claim you playas but you warmin' up the benches
I back-crack bitches on mats, whip out extensions
Hit the box on your backboard, piss on your track boy
Hijack a car for the landin' and then kill you
Shea Stadium, on the roof of the Paladium
And get head, 'til I bob through, this chick is premium
If any gun's pulled Snag'll be the one aimin' 'em
Lettin' off like a menace, all at your fuckin' tree
And leavin' you careless, Snag said it it's time to end it

[Verse Four - Phife Dawg]
Last but not least it's Mutt Ranks
Nice with the mic and you can take that to the bank
Knockin' all you maggots out the park like the Yanks
First nigga on stage, that's my word he's gettin' shanked
No longer Phife Dawg, see them bloody days are done with
Mutty Ranks now! Time that I get on some dumb shit
It's great goin' solo thats my motherfuckin' word!
You know my style Bay, gotta put myself first
Anybody poppin' shit then they get what they deserve
With chicks I get more action than a motherfuckin' verb
Come one, come all and you all will get served
Cats is hard-headed when the fuck will they learn
Too many fraud rappers, I don't know 'bout them I deal with
For those that's hard of hearin', G I'ma make you feel it
Fuck your pot smokin' and your sips of Hennesey
The pussy that you get, what the fuck that mean to me?
Handcuff these clowns and the rhymes they be sayin'
One smack to the mouth and they know you ain't playin'
When I'm on the mic, son there won't be no delayin'
Them niggas frontin' hard be the same niggas prayin'
Knawmsayin'?

[Hook 2x][Phife Dawg]
Uh-huh Phifey leaving MC's feeble, cuz they fact-less
Featherweight niggas got me fed, I'm here to fix shit
Diggy, fearless one, what, who giving feedback
Wish you facing feces, black, I'm saying 'fuck that'
Hip hop, something you feel, you cats sound feminine
Rid 'em, kid, hip hop fellow shit, aiyo, we live for this
Most niggas be fiasco out, sounding like duplicates
Feline shit, I'm a dog, can't fuck with it
I got the ability to produce like fertilization
Rich in material, you need a demonstration
Forget flagellation peep the maturation
No vacation, time to flood it, fuck the faking
Fluidity, baby, it's the shit you can't fathom
Niggas still flirting with floozy chickens with flat booties?
Fixated with them fake chicks, them hoes that been in porn flicks
You need to do, get to know about this flow shit
Flaming MC's, since the days of sporting flat tops
I got the flare for this, I love the fickle sport of hip hop
I live for check one-two's and you don't stop
Mr. Katrell, make the beat drop

[Hook 2x: Phife Dawg]
Alphabet soup for the mind, body and soul
Try it, you may like it, come grab, yourself a bowl
I'm sure most of my B-Boys and Girls, can straight relate
Before it's late, don't be fake, grab a plate

[Phife Dawg]
As I commence to set it off with this confident conglomerate
Consisting of concoctions, we have carved up for you
My crew, calmly stays consistent, but at the same time
We're confused, by the corny BS ya'll listen to
I do consider conquering these cornballs, til they catch up
With they conscience, can't control 'em by the motions that they choose to do
Who's concerned with some clown wearing Cardier, fronting
Like he down with each and every damn crew
It's time to wake up, my brothers, time to wake up, my sisters
Best consult with one another, cuz these cats ain't got a clue
Let's confide in one another, combine with one another
Coordinate, cooperate, on how the hell we moving through
What will it take to convince you, that this world is corrupt
Can we converge at a convention, showing that we give a fuck?
See life is more than what you claim to be, correlating in that cup
I'm constipated by that corny shit, most choose to construct

"Sick of gimmicks, mimics and mimes, wack rhymes"

[Phife Dawg]
Underdog, I have an undying love for this rap shit
Which leaves MC's unready which is unfortunate
I know me, dropping gems on this LP was unforeseen
But most MC's are just unfit, fucking with this legend from Queens
Fuck that, my MC's data's unforgettable, which is lovely
Which gives me reason to show you, why you be's my understudy
Who dares to challenge this, bring his unequal ass here
You spit first, then I show you why this battle's unfair
Yeah, now you fronting like my style be unfamiliar
You can't test the undertaker, fuck it, I had to kill ya
Undermine me if you'd like, but it's been said and told
Who laughs last, they laugh best, now watch the saga unfold

[Hook 2x]Malik, what are you gonna do with your life?
Are you gonna stand on the corner?
Are you gonna sit around with your friends?
You wanna wear new sneakers, you wanna have nice clothes
How 'bout gettin a job?
How 'bout finishin school?
How 'bout gettin your life together?
Don't you wanna prosper, don't you wanna be somebody?

[ VERSE 1: Phife ]
11-20-70, who would have known
That premature born will be grabbin microphones? (Mutty Rankin)
Called Malik Isaac Taylor to Walt and Cheryl
Grew up bein a sports fanatic, wantin to box for gold medals
Influenced by the likes of Ali and Sugar Ray
Magic Johnson, Tony Dorsett and Doctor Jay
Then came the Cold Crush, L.L. Cool J
Pops said he had to move to Cali, but nah, I had to stay
New York was all I ever knew, plus hip-hop started tweakin
Block parties every weekend, come home late, catch a beatin
Gettin grounded for months, to the jams young Phife was speedin
Only 4'8", still the ladies had me cheatin
I reminisce about them hot New York, nights grabbin mics
And hell, God forbid if your flow wasn't tight
Queens, L.I., nothin but flavor over here
I could tell you but so much, cause you had to be there
Growin up I spent much time with my nana, Mom was at work
Knew every version of Bible, I damn near lived in a church
Nana was 7th Day Adventist, those days I can't forget
All day, Saturday, I have to wait until the sun set
Friends would knock on my door: "Can Malik come out to play?"
"No hon, no way, not today, he has to pray"
Those famous words that my granny would say
Therefore I run my ass upstairs and sneak on the TV
Aw shit, _Soul Train_, better act like you know
I used to turn the volume down, so nobody would know
Now while I stared at Jodey Watley, I would practice my flow
Look at all them asses, yo, no doubt, on the low
Steady enjoyin the show, everything good to go
Low and behold, granny was right at the do'
Now I'm dealin with the punishment of pain - I sure deserved it
Proceedin to the fullest, only three hours since the sermon
Then comes the fatal question: "Did you learn anything from service?"
But in the name of hip-hop - for real - it's all worth it
You know my name

[ VERSE 2: Phife ]
Growin up in a West Indian household, it was real
All my Trini, Bahians, Haitians, Jamaicans, they know the deal
So many days doin nada, watchin cartoons on the couch
Underdog, Mighty Mouse, with the twizzler in my mouth
Mom dukes used to say, "That's all you care about
Eat, drink, sleep, shit up the toilet in my house"
Dropped out of high school, went to get a G.E.D
The only thing though on my mind is how I'm gonna emcee
God kicked out the crib, moved with my aunt in D.C
Used to make my housecalls, by sellin nickel bags of weed
Here and there I copped some gear, but I would stay with my dough
80 bucks a hour, just to hit studio
Everyday, every night, I be spittin my flows
Entered talent shows, would lose, cause they love the go-go
Walkin off the stage vexed, "y'all muthafuckas don't know"
Finally made a decision, to take my ass back home
Copped at job at Mickey D's, flippin burgers with cheese
Had to find a better way, cause this wasn't my speed
Tight uniforn pants, with the arch in the back
Phone ring, it's for Phife: "What up Shaheed, where you at?"
"Jive, muthafucka, we just signed a contract"
"Say word?" "Word bond, now give that uniform back"
Now I'm happy than a mutha, yo, you can't tell me shit
Couldn't wait to tell my mama: "I'm a celeb now, I quit"
From the tender age of 9, this is all I dreamed of
Hip-hop, the first chick, to ever have me in love
Tell the world my name

[ VERSE 1 ]
Growin up I used to use the Afro Sheen
Knicks and Lakers was my favorite basketball teams
Underground MC, but I can bring it mainstream
Rap style being seen like muthafuckin Tom Greene
In the immortal words of Rakim, I'm a microphone fiend
Trini say 'yes, Jamaica say 'seen'
(Hold it down) gotta hold it down for Queens
(Recognize) (my name is Phife)
People still takin rappin for a joke
All they know is chips, whips, dank, hoes and smoke
What we need is raw peoples who will practice they craft
Goin hard to the extreme, why would you go half-assed?
Call me the Cal Ripken of the industry (Carl who?)
Seen rappers shine, as well as seen some hang their head in misery
No matter what whoever said, I stuck with it
Stay committted, hence the reason competition stay gettin shitted
On - what - I've held shit in for so long
(Go 'head, Phife, get your man on)
Reminiscin 'bout them school lunch tables I used to bang on
Run-D.M.C. at M.S.G. gettin they shine on
Knowin one day I'd get that chance, yo
And the reward wasn't just dough, it was when people hit the danceflo'
A way with culture lyrics or shorties singin "Can I kick it?"
Yeah, that's the ticket, go 'head, show me your Tribe spirit
Man listen, I'm here to tell it
Success was bound to come, how I know? I can smell it
Phife be sharper than an arrow
Equivalent to Pete Rock or Primo collectin vinyl
Cause it's all about the love, yo
Battle whoever whenever, let's get it on, yo
Bust that ass like no tomorrow
Just to keep the flows up to par
But nowadays none of you maggots would like to spar
But here I are, 10 years in the cut
Five albums, did three of em dope, two of them ( *disgusted sound* ) - and such and such
But like they say, a true champ, he always rises
Phife Dawg, Da LP, full of surprises

(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas ain't got no clout
(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas got my name in your mouth
(Lemme find out)
Them labels lately puttin shit out

[ VERSE 2 ]
On my way to the club better known as One-Tweezy
Where you find them fake ballers and some hoes lookin sleazy
The place where robbin a nigga is so easy
Same club where strippers go, I think I found one to ease me
1:30 in the morning, taking it easy
This one dude's all in my shit, for a sec I thought I had tits, gee
I overheard him saying that my rap style was pussy
I'm nothin on my own, the rest were better without me
I couldn't comprehend, he said it under his breath
But when I did, no hesitation, to my business I stepped
What you say? Excuse me? Pardon? Oh, don't be a bitch, sucker
Now you wanna act shy? You know my name, muthafucka
Straight pussy nigga, oh now it's what, you don't know?
Believe me man, you can get that ass bust for sho'
Just because a nigga rappin, what you think it can't happen?
What the deal, you wanna dance? We can get straight to scrappin
Hm, I'm sayin Pete, you know the drilly, black (No doubt, son)
New York is to the fullest, we don't know how to act
But on a professional level, should I deal with this?
Like the Goodie Mob say, I'm too real for this
Work too muthafuckin hard for this, used to lie, cheat, steal for this
An innovator when it comes to this
Feed my fam with this, put clothes on they back with this
Bust my ass to be a part of this
Livin my life with this
Makin people straight rejoicin this
Aw fuck it, I'm so nice with this
I make your broad drop her drawers for this
Slit her wrist for this, and now what, punk, bitch
But fuck it yo, I ain't trippin
I know a asshole when I see one, just don't get caught slippin
So what the fuck now, nigga?
Yo, suck on ???? right here, in my pants, behind my zipper

(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas ain't got no clout
(Lemme find out)
Y'all niggas got my name in your mouth
(Lemme find out)

Ya hear me
Live life
Live long
Stay strong
I'm out
(No doubt, son)[Intro]
You know what
We been through so much together
When I first got down
In like seventy-nine
Pre-Tribe
During Tribe, post-Tribe
It's all gravy, can't let you go

[Verse One]
Used to think this game was a fairytale, until I met you
Never into bullshit, you were happy being you
My face would just glow anytime you walked past
Makin' a brotha jitter every time our eyes clashed
You were cooler than cool, smarter than most
Which made the Five-Footer get closer than close
And to our ten year bond, I have to give a toast
Cause the way that I feel, yo it ain't no joke
You got a brotha feelin' high like Busta-Bus when he smokes
And I ain't no weedhead so I might just choke
But if you make a power move and decide to be around
Then word to Flipmode, I'll smoke a whole damn pound
From Trini to Atlanta, (Yes) I'll romance you
Take you to ecstasy anytime I get the chance to
And I can rock you all night if you want me to
So what you wanna do? (Come on!)

[Phife w/ scratched hook by Butta L]
No Doubt
"Rock the mic" - Phife Dawg "Microphone" - Rakim
Phife Dawg, Pete Rock
"Rock the mic" "Microphone"
This is how it go down when a Trini and a Jamaican get together
"Rock the mic" "Microphone"
"Rock the mic" "Rock the mic"

[Verse Two]
I got a love jones for your body and your skin tone
Unplug the phone, we needs to be all alone
Tourin' straight for eight months, which means you can't front
And you know, and I know, I gots what you want
Never cuff you at the top, I tried to stop
You see I get after lock, when the crowd starts to rock
This one dyme up front started doin' the walk
The way she licked her lips it made a brotha real hot
She had the grill of Nia Long, smile of Stacy Dash
Front of Lisa Carson with the Mary Blige Ooh!
My friends be laughin' hard cause I lable you as fam
But they don't understand you have made me who I am
And at the end of the day, yo we'll have the last laugh
My boo's about to have twins, so we gots to get the cash
But as long as I live, that's my word, I'mma be there
For you, you, besides I love you, Mwoi!

[Phife w/ scratched hook by Butta L]
Come on
"The mic" - Phife Dawg "Microphone" - Rakim
Uh, bob your head to this
"The mic" "Microphone"
Get on the dance floor
"The mic" "Microphone"
And go for yours
"Microphone" "The mic"

[Verse Three]
See when the label started frontin' you were always there
When the management was frontin' you were always there
There were times when I felt the group had want to replace me
Whether I'm right or wrong you were there to embrace me
When you have too many sheets in one tent, how can you represent?
Shit be bugged, but you were there to show me love
That's when I kindly picked you up and moved to ATL
My attitude was like, whatever, might as well go for South
Guess they felt I wasn't worth it, didn't feel like Phifey had it
But now who's movin' units, motherfuckin' silly rabbits?
Peace to the few who had my back
For the fakers in my clique, fuck you, that's that
Life has really been worth living since I found you, true
And there's nothing in this world that Malik won't do
You're my latest and my greatest inspiration, true
I put this on my granny bible, I would die for you, uh

[Scratched hook by Butta L]

Rock to the joint, roll up a joint
Bust shots to the joint, Spike Lee to the joint
Bounce to the joint, screw to the joint
(Say what?) Yeah, you know it's on point (uh huh)

Just vibe to the joint, ride to the joint
Bump 'n grind to the joint, then skate to the joint
Now slide to the joint, act wild with a joint
Huh, once again it's on point, come on (here we go!)

[Verse One: Phife Dawg]
Party over here, fuck y'all over there
Drinks on Malik, ya live once, I don't care
Love the night life like Sonny love Cher
Bound to take a shorty home, put her ass in the air
Look at Miss Thingy, I heard she type pissy
One that'll have simple ways, that'll block and get busy
Fat Joe, Pun said it's all about trizzies
Spit the game in her ear, in the coatcheck chick
Had to give it to her, came out, pull out my zipper
Now I'm like "WHOA" cause her come my baby father
Shit money big, now I think I'm gonna need back up
He walked right next to me and smacked her ass up
WHOO that's a close one, here let me bounce
Third floor, gotta see who else is in the house
Up north, reppin with these chicks from down South
Shorty sippin Hennesey, singin 'put it in your mouth'

[Hook]
Rock to the joint, roll to the joint
Bust shots to the joint, Spike Lee to the joint
Bounce to the joint, screw to the joint
Uh, you know it's on point (no doubt)

Vibe to the joint, ride to the joint
Bump 'n grind to the joint, unwind to the joint
Slide to the joint, act wild to the joint (yeah)
You know it's on point, c'mon!

[Verse Two: Phife Dawg]
On towards chillin, now we at the after party
Com' Sense, Mos Def, fuck it - everybody!
Fuck chillin at the tele, I'm scoopin me a hottie
Chillin load of girls, and those shorties lookin sloppy
Came to the door, made the dancefloor wild
Shorties "Sayin My Name" like Destiny's Child (aah)
So I just smile, get em thirsty like 'ow'
I know I'm type foul, trippy steady on a pile
Eyes wide open like a motherfuckin owl
Who's this tig bitty chick with the Colgate smile?
Said her name was Tafy, with nose by to act me
Straight from St. Louis, said she'd love to do me
Smacked on her ass as if she worked at Big Skippy
Wanted to give my neck a hicky, but something 'bout her's tricky
Looked at the bar, oh shit it couldn't be!
The J to the A to the N to the E
You don't understand? Ask EPMD!
Thinkin to myself, goddammit why me?
Thinkin to myself, goddammit why me?
Thinkin to myself, goddammit why me?

[Hook]
Rock to the joint, roll to the joint
Bust shots to the joint, Spike Lee to the joint
Bounce to the joint, screw to the joint
Uh, you know it's on point (no doubt)

Now vibe to the joint, ride to the joint
Bump 'n grind to the joint, unwind to the joint
Slide to the joint, act wild to the joint
You know it's on point (no doubt, no doubt)

[Outro]
You know it's on point (no doubt)
You know it's on point (no doubt)
You know it's on point (on point..)[Phife]
Now in this hip-hop world I happen to live in, heads be bitching
It's a wonder that when the punks walk, they don't be switching
Someone always got something to say, and I be itching
To verbally bust their whole fucking frame, I ain't kidding
Nothing wack over here, moneygrip, I'm always hitting
And being that my name is Phife Dawg, I just be shitting
All over the track by Diamond, fuck a rumor
If you try to bite this style you might catch a brain tumor
Nowadays it's eather the Heather or cheddar, fuck the babbling
Put your money where your mouth is or there'll be no battling
Don't play yourself and get dissed by Malik, it's too embarassing
Take it straight to your face like Vin Rock, fuck the Samaritans
I'm out to get the cheddar, no deals, I ain't having it
Never to work again in my life, fuck Blake Harrington
East Coast representation, as well as West
Rub daddy speak, better listen, diggey knows best

[Diamond]
I'm swerving on MC's with these degrees
The only cheese you've seen is from promotional fees, please
I don't congregate with small timers
I leave you scratching your head like Alzheimer's
In a corner with four-timers smoking pretty women
With this city rhythm I get witty with them
Big D a.k.a. Ben Grin, I send men defending
You run home and then send
Your whole team back, scoped out I lean back
Focused on greenbacks, niggas want to see me in green slacks
Upstate doing a bid
But I got plans reclined at the Sands
With my team, in the name of cream
Sipping on Jim Beam, still scoped your scheme
It seems to me, it's obvious, it seems to be jealousy
Fuck it if it means the beat
Cause I dream to be the next one on the top
I might blow up, but I won't go pop
Fuck the props, I want to breeze with the cheese
And my squeeze in the Florida Keys

	Pains and strife, let me live my life
	Born into a world that's trife
	Like a knife I cut through the mazes
	State to state smashing down stages, overcome with...  (Repeat 2x)

[Diamond]
I'm off the hook, no more working off the book
I often look at how MC's turn soft and book
Look, you couldn't fade this renegade
]From when it's made, plus your rhymes are minute made
What's the deal, for real I watch you
Got you under my skin like Sinatra
Raise the stakes, see I believe it pays to make
A thousand ways to take your tasty cake

[Pete Rock]
Hit the spotlight, and let me get right
Crowd anticipation when we rock the mic
It's like sex, good to the very last nut
Every word that we say, every cliche
So check the survery, Phife Dawg rhyming with Diamond
Niggas get astounded, all simple like Simon
Cream, working on plots and schemes
To hit big clientel to the fullest, so represent, kid

	Pains and strife, let me live my life
	Born into a world that's trife
	Like a knife I cut through the mazes
	State to state smashing down stages, overcome with...  (Repeat 2x)
