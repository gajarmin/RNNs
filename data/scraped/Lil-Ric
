Song:   Rollin Thru My Hood

Yo kid man, stop the music

Rollin through my, rollin through my hood
This what I see when I'm rollin through my hood
2 to the 3 to the 4 the 5 the 6
And everybody in the ghetto trying to sew this bitch
Cause she's a dope fiend, she need emphetamine
But I'm the only motherfucker with the candy cream
Now the spots hot, here come the cops
The ??????????, it's time to close up shop
Time to move on, brothas on there cellular phones
Talkin to them hoochies, I mean them ding dongs
Cause in the ghetto everbody got nicknames
Like Master p, Lil Roy, and Big Man
Eyes red, dank to the head
I'm not Snoop Dogg but I feel like Lil Half Dead
Henace with a dab of that gin and juice
Gatorade, but it gotta be 80 proof
So we can remenisce to all the niggas missed
And when I said the ghetto's trying to kill me, feel this
Cause in my hood, it's rest in peace shirt
And every nigga in they momma done did dirt
Or formed a gang, or even ganged banged
Or slang dope, motherfucker it's the same thang
Cause where I'm from you got to watch your back
Cause every nigga in the town got a gat
And these hoes, you can't love em
Even though a motherfucker wanta kiss and rub em
Watch your back, cause gats go rat-tat
But mind your own motherfucker and it's like that

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

Rollin through the cuts
Dippin down the alleys of killa Cali
Big Ed got that top drop cause it's not cloudy
So I roll on, tank-top with my swoll on
Pullin in sun rays that be peepin through the ozone
I like to chill out, hang out
Cause I'm cool, you know Big Ed is in the mix with the fix
Fool, I seen niggas shakin ivory, hoes shakin asses
But everybody head turn when the coup passes
Who ride, I ride with my 9 ho
I creep as I crept cause I gotta keep that low pro

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

This nigga, I am one
Quick to use that A-K gun
On a mark motherfucker who wanta pick a bone
2 to the dome will do your ass home
Huh, ain't no love in my motherfucking hood
Lookin where I'm at, ain't shit turning all good
We need cash cause it's all about the fucking rent
We get the dice and start rollin on the pavement
That's how it is on the first of every month
Sippin gin, and toking off of blunts
Gettin higher than the sky, don't ask why
Young G's from the hood trying to get by

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

When I'm rollin through my hood
I see alot of factors, alot of actors
But since the money's low, I see alot of jackers
But where I stay at, it be the east to the bay
But what do I be dippin, it be a 6 to a tre
And what do I be strappin, it be a ace to a K
But I don't love them hoes, that's why I never ever play
In the 9-4, I use to sell dope and holla at the bitch
But it's 9-5 so it's all about me trying to get a grip
14 niggas in a cut tryin to get at the butt but it ain't all good
Cause a nigga like set trippin up in my neighborhood
???? through the cut, I see task hoppin off of the tree
It's all about mine, so it's all about me tryin to get a fee
Can't trust none of these hoes, I leave them hoes at the bus
Cause it's one motherfucking thing in this world that you can't trust
It be a bitch, cause they a snitch, they get you caught up
In this game, heavy locked up, tore up from the floor up
I seen this bitches, these niggas
These niggas all the same
It's a scandel thang, and Silkk won't be caught up in this ghetto game

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood

I hit the play twice, and then I'm off to a get away
Where I got my shit hid away in the cut
A personal yaht, I snatch a few sacks
About to hit the track to come up on some scraps
Hit the block sideways, perking, trippin
Swervin, I'm servin the shit that I made cause it's tight
All night long nigga's hustle for paper
24-7 nigga's stay on the caper
Gotta get them riches, and you gotta have game yo
Gotta keep lie-lo with them hollow
You see it's still going down
Motherfuckers gettin bucked in the town
The silent sound
Never go away, every other day it's another nigga in the game
Straight passed away
And as well as we all know
It's a little bitty city where motherfuckers bound to get shitty
Now when I roll through my spot
I see niggas like broke, with them Glocks, 17 shots nigga
Hot nigga, pop you nigga, and I just bought a 4-5 in the hood
(in the hood, in the hood)

Like that, check it out fool
It's a ghetto thang, ghetto thang, ghetto thang
And if you ain't from the ghetto you wouldn't understand

Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood
Rollin through my hood, rollin through my hood
That is what i see when I'm rollin through my hood
Rollin through my hoodVerse 1 (Master P)

Four niggas in the Chev and we all strapped
Put one up in the chamber case we had to bust caps
Let me let you know bitch who you fucking with
Master P killa murder motherfucking lunatic
With the giggety giggety nine
Put the Glock to your dome and your shit will be giggety mine
Break you off something proper bitch
Ask me where I'm from the manor central soutside of the Rich
Worry niggas can't stand me
Cause I'm known on the turf for serving
Them fiends that fucking killa candy
Break 'em off as I creep slow
But if you run up on the P
Yeah you know you get your ass smoked
12 o'clock and my beeper still beeping
On my way to the northside late night creeping

(Chorus)

Late night creeping (creeping)
Should I say jacking or should I say skeezing

The dope fiends be begging me for crack
Although they want to beat me with they baseball bats

Verse 2 (Master P)

Red and to the blue will be the giggety plain giggety thang
A nigga slang dope, but the P I don't gang bang
Leave a sucker dead any mark on a slab of rock
Arrive at your house smoke a sherm than a nigga laugh
Play a game called show and tell
And if the bitch is hella thick tell her meet me at the motel
Cause slipping is a no no
And the bitch better come true so long at the mo mo
I'll leave a bitch dead and broke
Check a ho, I ain't no motherfucking got damn captain save a ho
So with my nine I be sleeping
Check it out bitch if you catch me late night creeping

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Master P, Lil'Ric)

I can't sleep at night my mind start playing tricks
I'm having nightmares the ghetto's trying to kill me bitch
I'm paranoid, I sleep with three fucking gats
A tech nine, a oozie, and a carjack
I'm addicted to money and bitches hella disturb
A ounce of dank, that'll calm a nigga nerves
I will mash on that ass like a gas pedal
You owe me scraps I will melt you like a piece of metal
I'm a bounce your ass just like a basketball
And with a pig's blood, write your name up on the wall
So make your fucking death wish
And why you dead I'm gone steal your goods and fuck your bitch
I'm a let you know life in the Rich ain't no joke
So don't you coming riding without your straps ho
And you know the Rich is known for busting caps
Diggety zap the P put the Rich on the giggety map

Lil' Ric

Yeah, back at that ass once again there
Its your nigga Lil Ric, creepin through the windows
Getting him for whatever I can get
Now its time for my niggas to ride
And let this shit fuckin clear

Verse 4 (Big Ed)

Late night creeping Big Ed and Master P
P has got his tech I got my nine next to me
Cause niggas like to jack and in the Bay it never stops
But my hollow tips will leave more scars than the chicken pox
Or run up ya like Emmitt
Hitting like Bonds cause I have a nice slugging percentage
Because a nigga's like loced
Run on up, I'll call ya hickory because your gonna get smoked
I ain't no joker g cause I'm TRU
And everybody in my crew a TRU g too
I thought you knew motherfucker
I'm the type of nigga that'll leave ya fucking heart in the gutter
With the rat-tat-tat rat-tat-tat rat-tat-tat-tat
P, I'm gone put this fucking nigga on his back
I'm a show you why they sleeping
Cause its me and P and we late night creeping

(Chorus)Niggas gonna ride high to die
And I'm 'gon stay ridin' high
Ride high to die

(Lil Ric)
Straight from the block with a Glock

And twomp sacks, fuck this brew
We meet and straight yack a fifth of that please
Straight to the trees
Mobbin' villan life, livin' that wicked rich life
Nuttin' nice off the heazy
You will not want to see thee
Gorilla motherfuckers puttin' a mash straight down
That ass seein' all fucked up and bucked down
Got scrilla downtown, bet I got a swoop
Then fuck the bitch on a fuke in my niggas coup
Whoomp there it is, case gets dismissed
Back on the streets with Glock and block zibs
Shits more funky than a weak dead donkey
Man it's on in the ghetto
Everybody got metal
Lookin' for strips daylight
Through midnight this shit might
Go down on sight
Now I'm gettin' through the city of life
4 deep in a rented Jeep Cherokee
I see my G from the block and
He taking flockin' a reno
But come up on some quick c-notes (c-notes)
They got a kite for my nigga big track
Him and Spice doin' 23 and ones of FED max
Bought an AP strap to donate to the hood
That's ready to clock a (?) track
With the whole click if it's good
Now I'm rollin' through the southside
Smokin' vegas gettin' high
Deep on the scene with the gangsta lean
Triple beam sceems workin'
Niggas from every turf spendin' bread with this loot
Knuckle heads see the feds got they
Eyes watchin', this niggas in his 50 knockin'
I hit back and ugh, early mornin' make me shoppin'
See Lou with it with Eightball
On the mission for scrilla gettin' bigga
And we 'gon straight ball
Since the hall where them wild juveniles played
Been witness in murders from the buck shot
To the ten gadge spray
We 'gon ride, ugh
And ya

Chorus x3
This is for the niggas who we ride fo sho
For the niggas gettin' scrilla on they grind fo sho
For my niggas locked down doin' time fo sho
And for the bitches who be lovin' us 'doe

See me and my niggas be ride fo sho
See me and my niggas be on the grind fo sho
And man, a few of my niggas doin time fo sho
But punk bitches be lovin' us 'doe
See me and my niggas be ride fo sho
May me and my niggas be on the grind fo sho
May some of my niggas doin' time fo sho
But punk bitches be lovin' us 'doe
