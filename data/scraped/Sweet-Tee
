[Intro]
What, you didn't know Christmas went hip-hop?
Check the clock, and let the jingle bells rock

[Verse 1]
Snow on my window pane, eating candy canes
Christmas is here, I feel it in my veins
To celebrate, the 25th is the date
It's time for love, it's not too late
Sit by the tree shining bright
Listening to the carols on the radio all night
Snuggle close with the one you love
Kiss while the mistletoe hangs above
You don't know what you're missing til you miss it
Christmas is fun, so get with it
What, you didn't know Christmas went hip-hop?
Check the clock, and let the jingle bells rock

[Verse 2]
I saw a wreath hanging on every door
Santa on the corner getting cash for the poor
People shopping, their eyes filled with gleam
Store windows have a Christmas theme
Chestnuts roasting, champagne toasting
Kids on the corner with their new toys, boasting
Open your heart, cause Tee has an earful
No time for hate, be cheerful
Snowflakes falling, relatives calling
It's Christmas so have a ball an'
Rock with Sweet Tee cause I'm pumping
When I'm in the place, I gets the party jumping
So get near it, I know you hear it
Tee's doing it up with the Christmas spirit
You said you didn't know Christmas went hip-hop?
Check the clock, and let the jingle bells rock

[Verse 3]
How many of you can seriously say
You heard a girl rock the mic this way?
I say it with feeling, add a little passion
But I do it in a ladylike fashion
On the go, whether fast or slow
I'm a pro, so my rhymes flow
Grab a friend and have some fun here
Christmas is once a year
Turn on your radio, rock with Sweet Tee
Shake your body to the Christmas beat, so
Now you know Christmas is hip-hop
Don't stop, let the jingle bells rock

[Verse 4]
The last day of the year is here, so now you know
At the stroke of twelve, you gotta let it go
Out with someone dear
Throw confetti, scream, "Happy New Year!"
In with the new, out with the old
Sweet Tee is signing off, and now you've been told to
Make it good, do it up right
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night

Let the jingle bells rock(Rolling tape)
Hurby, my headphones are not loud enough
(Alright
Yo Dre, pump it up somethin
How's that?)
Yeah, let's do this

[ VERSE 1 ]
Sweet Tee's in the groove, yes, I'm back on the move
It's the thriller to kill, cause I got nothin to lose
I'm at the top of the heap, Hurby was lookin at me
And oh, how they screamed (Go Sweet Tee!)
Just wanted nothin but fun, cause I'm second to none
And I'm here in the flesh to show how it is to be done
So turn your speakers way up, until your ears start to pop
And if your mom starts beefin, say, "Mom, do the Whop"
Hop on the dancefloor, dance to the music
Toe-slam to my jam, you can do it
I write rhymes, and to the world I'm givin
(Get busy, Sweet Tee) That's the way I'm livin
Leather or lace as I step in the place
People come to say hi cause they know my face
And you know I'm stylin, nails I'm filin
Standin on stage, smilin, profilin
Lean, mean, breakin out on the scene
Me and the girls steppin fresh outta Queens
So if you wanna have a ball, give me a call
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all

[ VERSE 2 ]
Nonchalant as I flaunt the style I know you want
Like a ghost in your mind, it's your conscience I haunt
When I rap I bring joy to every girl, every boy
Some think I play games cause my name is Toi
Back to raise hell, I got records to sell
I'm still on the top, don't you think I fell
Never takin a loss, weak rappers I toss
Make no mistake, Sweet Tee is the boss
Janet Jackson's nasty, but I'm in control
Aretha Franklin, bow down to the new queen of soul
Never settle for less, god is my witness
Jog every day for physical fitness
Climbin higher, I'll never retire
Rap so hot, they start three alarm fires
But don't be alarmed, it's just my grace and my charm
I'm here for the good, I'll never do you no harm
Sweet Tee's on the money, you know I'm makin it
I do it live, so you know I ain't fakin it
Five foot eight, standin ten feet tall
And if you ask me why, it's like that y'all

[ VERSE 3 ]
Slam on the jam just as hard as you can
While I rock the mic with my all-girl band
And you know I'm clever, taken down never
Give me a beat, and I'm a cold-blooded terror
My voice is on wax, now you know I'm set
Cause the better the rhyme, the more money I get
And I hope I'm told, when my record's old
That they all got sold, and my jam went gold
I give it all I got, and all I got I give
I take no shorts, that's the way I live
Tee's on the move, and I never get moved on
(Long live the queen) Well, I'ma live real long
I'm the people's choice, so all the people choose me
Keep my beeper beepin, so the fellas don't lose me
Sly as a fox, sippin juice on the rocks
When I get on the roll, I can never be stopped
When I'm good I'm good, and when I'm bad I'm better
Keep that in mind and don't you forget that
I write the rhymes that make you jump off the wall
And you wanna know why? It's like that y'all

[ VERSE 4 ]
Cruisin down the street in my jett-black Volvo
Rockin to the radio playin [song name]
Heads all turn as I drive by
As I wave to the fellas, all the fellas say (hi)
Stepped on the gas, and I went to the disco
The music's pumpin and the people screamin (Ho!)
The place is packed and people shakin their bodies
The crowd outside is screamin (We wanna party!)
Jump on the stage, knuckleheads began the rampage
They stopped short when my girl pulled the 12-guage
Rocked anyway, cause I'm bad, and I'm bold
Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole
If you know what it is, then you know I'm a whiz
Toes are tappin while I'm rappin, cause I'm in showbiz
Autographs I sign while they stand in line
I remain number one till I'm 109
I play no games, and you know I ain't frontin
Let me know if you wanna start a little somethin
Why? Cause I'm a heavyweight, I go for it all
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'allI got this feelin, and it's makin me break in-
To a cold sweat whenever I'm present
It doesn't matter how long
If you wasn't down from now on
You'll be around to count on
This feeling, put you down with the program
Like I am
So just dance till you feel how I feel now
Sweet Tee's cold rockin the crowd
Turn up the music, I'm a fanatic
Make it heard from basement to attic
Keepin you hooked like an addiction
Sweet Tee is fact, not fiction
On the records you hear me rhymin
On the charts you see me climbin
To the top of the deck, and I'm dealin
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin

Now's the time, so check your timex
Hold tight while I take you to the climax
Of the music, yeah, that'll work
Get on the dancefloor, go bezerk
Tee is here to let you know
That you others got to go
I'm steppin hard, steppin strong
Step out my way or, get stepped on
I entertain, make you go insane
Stick with me when I'm on the mic, and
You'll feel no pain, I'll keep you up
Like a cup of Saeco
Get down like a sailboat anchor
I'm on a roll, and I'm wheelin
I'm Sweet Tee, and I got the feelin

Stop and - ehm, listen to the rhythm of
Sweet Tee, then fall in love
Cause I'm hype, Tee's on the mic
When I do it, I do it right
[Name] is on the cuts and
She makes party people shake their butts and
She gets busy, she ain't no joke
And with Tee on the mic - you know we dope
In demand, as I expand
I know how
So here and now
I'll take my stand
This ain't no game, I ain't playin
Listen to the words I'm sayin
At the top of the deck, and I'm dealin
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin

Now what I want you to do is
Get wet
Let yourself perspire
Get hot like your body's on fire
Get ready, so you can observe
The man with the beats - make it funky, Hurb

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move it
Start sweatin, cause I'm lettin me
Be real good, no one's forgettin me
I'm good to go, yo
I'm not a amateur, Tee's a pro, so
I give no slack
Cause it's like that
I'll be back, jack
Cause I got the feelin

If it feels good
(She's got it)		(2x)

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move itTestin my mic, one-two, one-two
I'm here to entertain, yes, this means you
Don't need no help, all by myself
I proceed cos you need to enjoy yourself
Try to compare? oh, don't you dare
Cos I'm sweeter than the cream in a french eclair
Smoother than the ice in a skatin rink
Have I forgotten anything? hm, let me think
Oh yes, I take a pen, draw you all in line
You'll find that I'm a lyrical mastermind
The more you scream, the more I strive
So get live and put your body in overdrive
Let's check the situation from a serious tip
Wanna hear somethin wack? well, this ain't it
Cos the beat is def and now you're told
So prepare to work out a little rock and roll
Lace them shoes, tighten up that belt
And beware cos it's somethin that you never felt
Cos it's ruffer than ruff, hipper than hip
Don't be a drip, let it rip
But on the smooth tip

Toes are tappin, hands are clappin
My deejay's on the cuts and Sweet Tee's rappin
Rockin the spot cos the jam is hot
You think I'm through? hm, not by a long shot
I'm not a doctor, but I'm on call
I'm not the police, so get off the wall
In a club on stage to make you move
A mic and a beat are the tools I use
Yeah, I been crowned the gift of wax
Sweet Tee's in the house, so just relax
Give your hips a ride, give your feet some slide
And do what you feel inside, you know
It's easy to do if the beat is hip
Dancin and swingin, if the needle don't skip
Straight to the dancefloor, run, don't walk
Move to the groove, let your body talk
To me cos I happen to know what you like
So when I pick up a pen I know what to write
To hype the jam, so the jam'll hit
So rock with Sweet Tee on the smooth tip

Move that stuff, put your body in cruise
Take it easy and slow, but make it smooth
Gather around and get on down
Ain't nothin like hangin when you got some sounds
To this career I been ordained
Doin things a anthropolgist can't explain
Try if you will, I leave em stand still
Rap better than me, that noise please kill
Solve any crime like the great Dick Tracy
Make more jazz than the late Count Basie
Rhythmic sounds flow like Lake Eerie
Alterin any scientifical theory
Another like me well, I - never
You know why? cos I'm too damn clever
I'm the rap soloist that you can't resist
Bust that, party people, then again, bust this
It's time for my rhyme to reach the end of the line
I hope you all had a groovy time
Without further ado I'mma take my trip
But remember Sweet Tee, y'all, on the smooth tipHow shall I rock thee?
Let me count the ways

(1-2-3-4 - hit it)

The bass is thumpin, the party is jumpin
I got the rhymes to keep your body pumpin
To keep you rockin, that's what I intend ta
This ain't number one on the Sweet Tee agenda
I'm gonna break it down, so you can see
The skillfull way I recite my poetry
Quick as a flash, I'll pop upon the scene
Break out the Casio and the drum machine
Got to get busy, cause I know I'm down
As I tap into my instruments this funky sound
Prone to make your body start to perspire
As I turn the volume up higher and higher
Grab my JVC, pop in a cassette
Have the people stompin to my beat, you bet
Play it for my friends cause it sounds so neat
And they ask (What do you call it?) It's My Beat
(Ha, what?) It's My Beat
It's my beat

So take a minute and wipe your sweat
But don't lose your tissue, cause I'm not done yet
I'll jump on the stage, the crowd will come swarm in
And through the bass bottoms my beat'll come stormin
In, like a beast, breakin out of his cage
Pursuin eardrums with a deadly rage
Cold kickin ass, a blast from the past
First in line, all you weak ones are last
I'm simply novelist to say the least
And if I want to be conceited, I'll hear myself, chief
Ace lady rapper, cold queen of hip-hop
Have the people screamin (Sweet Tee, don't stop)
Just gettin busy, I'm tellin you, baby
Take it as a promise, no ifs, ands, or maybes
Totally convinced, I wouldn't call it conceit
But I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat

I'm the entrepreneur of the hip-hop decor
Have you people rampagin and hit the dancefloor
Freak to my melody, get hip to my beat
As I display my rhymes so viciously, see
Eh, I'm on the top, number one, yes uno
Don't play stupid, cause I know that you know
So go take the chance cause you don't wanna miss
Jazzy Joyce on the mix, rock my funky beat, bust this
(It's in my shape
About to work me to death)
My beat is rough, but yet it's so tender
Do the right thing, party people, surrender
Go with the flow, cause I want you to know
That the lady Sweet Tee is runnin this here show
Ain't nothin to it but to go ahead and do it
Don't need a pair of sneakers to run right through it
Situation's stable, no question about it
Me get rocked by who? I doubt it
I'm only gonna tell you once, dog on it
Do yourself a favor and g- g- get on it
Super high post, I catch the beat with ease
Demolishin rappers while I'm shootin the breeze
So be on the look-out, Sweet Tee's comin
Fast with the rhymes and twice as stunnin
Make my day and you face defeat
Cause I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat

(1-2-3-4 - hit it)

Due to circumstances you'll have to be aware
That Sweet Tee and Jazzy Joyce are definitely here
To stay on the top, right where we belong
And if you think we can be taken, I'm sorry, you're wrong
Quite confidentially I'm well aware
That I'm talkin out my face, but I just don't care
Cause we're the ultimate, on the top, can't you see
You better never ever sleep on Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee
Jazzy Joyce (On the wheels) Jazzy Joyce (No one better)
Jazzy Joyce (Speedin faster than a '86 Jetta)
Cold bloody terrorizin, baby, that you can bet
(And if you battle me, never let me see you sweat)
Yo, put on your glasses, so that you can see
That's right, it's all about Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee
Now you know about us, my voice real clear
Peace out, yo, be easy, Jazzy Joyce, we're outta here[ VERSE 1 ]
As the beat goes on, I do damage
Sit on your couch, grab a soda, a sandwich
Entertaining is what I get paid for
Sweet Tee is rockin hardcore
That's my life, word, it's essential
Easy to get, whether if you know the fundamentals
The music comes on, strong, slammin
Hear the people say, "Damn, she's jammin!"
Speedin up the beat, cause it's time for you to
Hear new rhymes, cause the old ones won't do
It's My Beat, that's finished, done through
That's part one, this is part two
Pausin for the cause, and I'm comin out a winner
I keep my rhymes with me through my breakfast, lunch, and dinner
Risin and surprisin those who thought I couldn't do it
They didn't take me seriously, so now they blew it
You thought I was a regular? Come on now, stop it
I use the same beat twice, and still rock it
I'm in the right, doin no wrong
Singin my song as the beat goes on

[ VERSE 2 ]
As the beat goes on, it's a cryin shame
When I flip on those who thought I was a regular dame
Better step back, cause I'm gonna go off
Hm - think again if you think I'm soft
I'll squeeze you like a vice, and punch like Tyson
Stick to my rhymes like white on rice, and
Gettin to the point, and the point is this
Like Reggie on the play, when I hit, I don't miss
Hittin hard, raps well written
Rock so hard, others think about quittin
Takin my skills up to a much higher level
Rap by myself, cause I'm a queen rap rebel
Sincerely speakin, can't you see that
I'm number one, you better believe that
I'm on the verge, cause I got the urge to
Get the feelin, so I wanna splurge, I'll
Jump in my car, throw down the top
Sip some wine and listen to some hip-hop
Max and relax to the break of dawn
As - as the beat goes - as the beat goes on

[ VERSE 3 ]
Tee is here, and on the mic I'm a pro
Don't tell me that I'm good, I know
Demandin respect, and I get it
I write what I recite, and you can check the writer's credits
Lethal with a pen, the result is awesome
Combinin with my crew, and it's a one-two-three-foursome
Paid when I talk, my pockets are chunky
Hurb's on the beats, and it's soundin rather funky
Weak rhyme-hater, ready now and never later
Bring the great and the greatest, and I'll still be greater
On the strenght, not the bench I'm a heavyweight fighter
Sting more deadly than a black widow spider
Cooler than suede, and I don't mean leather
Entrepreneur of the rap world forever
Standin on my feet or sittin in my seat
You other rappers are obsolete
So get ready and set, and I'm on the go
I'll seize the crowd and squeeze out woe
I'll never overstay my welcome, so
I'ma drop the mic and let the beat flowThe first day that we met, it was love at first sight
You were my thoughts everyday and dreams every night
This was it and I knew it cause it felt so strong
In my heat and my soul that this love would be life long
But you were to fine and I was too blind to see all the games that you
Played with my mind
All the agony...baby can't you see (How could you do this to me?)
I asked you time and time was there someone else
You always said no thinking of yourself
Not that I'd be hurt or torn apart
Didn't make a difference if you broke my heart in two
Cause you knew how much I loved you
Everything you say, everything you do
I could go on and on and on like a chant
But to forgive you I just can't
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
But why did it have to be me

(CHORUS)
Why did it have to be me?
Please tell me why?
Why did it have to me?
Tell me, Tell me,tell me

You know it use to be great
Just you and me
You'd take my hand and we'd walk down by the sea
I remember when you asked me to be yours I said yes
Because without a doubt, I knew I had the best
You bought gold and diamonds, and furs
A car, a house with towels marked his and hers
You'd hold me so tight that I'd wanna pop
But then I'd whisper in your ear, don't stop
Things started changing, what did I do wrong
To have you pouring my heart into this love song
You'd leave in the evening, return in the morning
Say that you're tired, but you're not even yawning
You smell real good, but it's not your cologne
It's the scent of a perfume that I don't own
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
But why did it have to me

(CHORUS)
Please tell me why, why did it have to me
Please tell me why, Tell me, tell me (uhhh...hhh)
(repeat twice)

(Talking)
You know, one thing you'll learn is true
What you do to others will turn around and be done to you
It's the way The Almighty made it you see
Those who give pain will receive it eventually
Cause love is secrete, love is loving, love is love
It can't be replaced with anything you can think
But one day its gonna happen to you
The girl that you loved, she won't love you
Then you'll see how it feels when you can't eat meals
And you find out the heartaches are for real
Then you'll think about me
Just think about me
But don't call me
Because you'll be looking in the mirror and asking yourself
Why did it have to me?
Why me? Why me?[Intro]

Make it heard from basement to attic
Keepin you hooked like an addiction
Sweet Tee is fact, not fiction
On the records you hear me rhymin
On the charts you see me climbin
To the top of the deck, and I'm dealin
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin

Now's the time, so check your timex
Hold tight while I take you to the climax
Of the music, yeah, that'll work
Get on the dancefloor, go bezerk
Tee is here to let you know
That you others got to go
I'm steppin hard, steppin strong
Step out my way or, get stepped on
I entertain, make you go insane
Stick with me when I'm on the mic, and
You'll feel no pain, I'll keep you up
Like a cup of Saeco
Get down like a sailboat anchor
I'm on a roll, and I'm wheelin
I'm Sweet Tee, and I got the feelin

Stop and - ehm, listen to the rhythm of
Sweet Tee, then fall in love
Cause I'm hype, Tee's on the mic
When I do it, I do it right
[Name] is on the cuts and
She makes party people shake their butts and
She gets busy, she ain't no joke
And with Tee on the mic - you know we dope
In demand, as I expand
I know how
So here and now
I'll take my stand
This ain't no game, I ain't playin
Listen to the words I'm sayin
At the top of the deck, and I'm dealin
Sweet Tee's in effect, and I got the feelin

Now what I want you to do is
Get wet
Let yourself perspire
Get hot like your body's on fire
Get ready, so you can observe
The man with the beats - make it funky, Hurb

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move it
Start sweatin, cause I'm lettin me
Be real good, no one's forgettin me
I'm good to go, yo
I'm not a amateur, Tee's a pro, so
I give no slack
Cause it's like that
I'll be back, jack
Cause I got the feelin

If it feels good
(She's got it)		(2x)

If it feels good, then prove it
On the dancefloor, y'all, move it(Rolling tape)
Hurby, my headphones are not loud enough
(Alright
Yo Dre, pump it up somethin
How's that?)
Yeah, let's do this

[ VERSE 1 ]
Sweet Tee's in the groove, yes, I'm back on the move
It's the thriller to kill, cause I got nothin to lose
I'm at the top of the heap, Hurby was lookin at me
And oh, how they screamed (Go Sweet Tee!)
Just wanted nothin but fun, cause I'm second to none
And I'm here in the flesh to show how it is to be done
So turn your speakers way up, until your ears start to pop
And if your mom starts beefin, say, "Mom, do the Whop"
Hop on the dancefloor, dance to the music
Toe-slam to my jam, you can do it
I write rhymes, and to the world I'm givin
(Get busy, Sweet Tee) That's the way I'm livin
Leather or lace as I step in the place
People come to say hi cause they know my face
And you know I'm stylin, nails I'm filin
Standin on stage, smilin, profilin
Lean, mean, breakin out on the scene
Me and the girls steppin fresh outta Queens
So if you wanna have a ball, give me a call
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'all

[ VERSE 2 ]
Nonchalant as I flaunt the style I know you want
Like a ghost in your mind, it's your conscience I haunt
When I rap I bring joy to every girl, every boy
Some think I play games cause my name is Toi
Back to raise hell, I got records to sell
I'm still on the top, don't you think I fell
Never takin a loss, weak rappers I toss
Make no mistake, Sweet Tee is the boss
Janet Jackson's nasty, but I'm in control
Aretha Franklin, bow down to the new queen of soul
Never settle for less, god is my witness
Jog every day for physical fitness
Climbin higher, I'll never retire
Rap so hot, they start three alarm fires
But don't be alarmed, it's just my grace and my charm
I'm here for the good, I'll never do you no harm
Sweet Tee's on the money, you know I'm makin it
I do it live, so you know I ain't fakin it
Five foot eight, standin ten feet tall
And if you ask me why, it's like that y'all

[ VERSE 3 ]
Slam on the jam just as hard as you can
While I rock the mic with my all-girl band
And you know I'm clever, taken down never
Give me a beat, and I'm a cold-blooded terror
My voice is on wax, now you know I'm set
Cause the better the rhyme, the more money I get
And I hope I'm told, when my record's old
That they all got sold, and my jam went gold
I give it all I got, and all I got I give
I take no shorts, that's the way I live
Tee's on the move, and I never get moved on
(Long live the queen) Well, I'ma live real long
I'm the people's choice, so all the people choose me
Keep my beeper beepin, so the fellas don't lose me
Sly as a fox, sippin juice on the rocks
When I get on the roll, I can never be stopped
When I'm good I'm good, and when I'm bad I'm better
Keep that in mind and don't you forget that
I write the rhymes that make you jump off the wall
And you wanna know why? It's like that y'all

[ VERSE 4 ]
Cruisin down the street in my jett-black Volvo
Rockin to the radio playin [song name]
Heads all turn as I drive by
As I wave to the fellas, all the fellas say (hi)
Stepped on the gas, and I went to the disco
The music's pumpin and the people screamin (Ho!)
The place is packed and people shakin their bodies
The crowd outside is screamin (We wanna party!)
Jump on the stage, knuckleheads began the rampage
They stopped short when my girl pulled the 12-guage
Rocked anyway, cause I'm bad, and I'm bold
Another rapper couldn't touch me with a ten-foot pole
If you know what it is, then you know I'm a whiz
Toes are tappin while I'm rappin, cause I'm in showbiz
Autographs I sign while they stand in line
I remain number one till I'm 109
I play no games, and you know I ain't frontin
Let me know if you wanna start a little somethin
Why? Cause I'm a heavyweight, I go for it all
I'm Sweet Tee, it's like that y'allHow shall I rock thee?
Let me count the ways

(1-2-3-4 - hit it)

The bass is thumpin, the party is jumpin
I got the rhymes to keep your body pumpin
To keep you rockin, that's what I intend ta
This ain't number one on the Sweet Tee agenda
I'm gonna break it down, so you can see
The skillfull way I recite my poetry
Quick as a flash, I'll pop upon the scene
Break out the Casio and the drum machine
Got to get busy, cause I know I'm down
As I tap into my instruments this funky sound
Prone to make your body start to perspire
As I turn the volume up higher and higher
Grab my JVC, pop in a cassette
Have the people stompin to my beat, you bet
Play it for my friends cause it sounds so neat
And they ask (What do you call it?) It's My Beat
(Ha, what?) It's My Beat
It's my beat

So take a minute and wipe your sweat
But don't lose your tissue, cause I'm not done yet
I'll jump on the stage, the crowd will come swarm in
And through the bass bottoms my beat'll come stormin
In, like a beast, breakin out of his cage
Pursuin eardrums with a deadly rage
Cold kickin ass, a blast from the past
First in line, all you weak ones are last
I'm simply novelist to say the least
And if I want to be conceited, I'll hear myself, chief
Ace lady rapper, cold queen of hip-hop
Have the people screamin (Sweet Tee, don't stop)
Just gettin busy, I'm tellin you, baby
Take it as a promise, no ifs, ands, or maybes
Totally convinced, I wouldn't call it conceit
But I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat

I'm the entrepreneur of the hip-hop decor
Have you people rampagin and hit the dancefloor
Freak to my melody, get hip to my beat
As I display my rhymes so viciously, see
Eh, I'm on the top, number one, yes uno
Don't play stupid, cause I know that you know
So go take the chance cause you don't wanna miss
Jazzy Joyce on the mix, rock my funky beat, bust this
(It's in my shape
About to work me to death)
My beat is rough, but yet it's so tender
Do the right thing, party people, surrender
Go with the flow, cause I want you to know
That the lady Sweet Tee is runnin this here show
Ain't nothin to it but to go ahead and do it
Don't need a pair of sneakers to run right through it
Situation's stable, no question about it
Me get rocked by who? I doubt it
I'm only gonna tell you once, dog on it
Do yourself a favor and g- g- get on it
Super high post, I catch the beat with ease
Demolishin rappers while I'm shootin the breeze
So be on the look-out, Sweet Tee's comin
Fast with the rhymes and twice as stunnin
Make my day and you face defeat
Cause I'm Sweet Tee and it's my beat

(1-2-3-4 - hit it)

Due to circumstances you'll have to be aware
That Sweet Tee and Jazzy Joyce are definitely here
To stay on the top, right where we belong
And if you think we can be taken, I'm sorry, you're wrong
Quite confidentially I'm well aware
That I'm talkin out my face, but I just don't care
Cause we're the ultimate, on the top, can't you see
You better never ever sleep on Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee
Jazzy Joyce (On the wheels) Jazzy Joyce (No one better)
Jazzy Joyce (Speedin faster than a '86 Jetta)
Cold bloody terrorizin, baby, that you can bet
(And if you battle me, never let me see you sweat)
Yo, put on your glasses, so that you can see
That's right, it's all about Jazzy Joyce and Sweet Tee
Now you know about us, my voice real clear
Peace out, yo, be easy, Jazzy Joyce, we're outta here[ INTRO ]
As the turntables turn, the wheels burn
Pay attention, there's a lesson to learn
I'm about to get hype, so take a chance
What I want you to do now, is dance

	Let's dance

[ VERRSE 1 ]
Put the needle to my record, step back, and watch it go
You wanna hear if it's good? Huh, now you know
I want you to observe
The way I say every noun, every verb
I'm superb, word to Hurb
Bustin a rap while your feet tap
On time with my rhymes while my DJ rocks the scratch
I'm in the midst of a rappin blizz
And you ain't never heard a girl rock the mic like this
Out of those seats, yo bee, you gotta dance for me
Scream and yell, cause the record's gonna sell, you see
So tell a friend, and a friend how hype it is
Never sour, gonna tell you how ripe it is
Get with the go, with the flow, with the action
Time after time I'ma come back maxin
So just take this chance to get some ants in your pants
Under this circumstance, all you gotta do is dance

[ Chorus ]
	Dance
	I know you got the feeling
	Let's dance
	Come on and get down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Sittin in my room with a pen and a pad
Wouldn't say I was bored, well, just a tad
I wrote this rhyme to make you dance
Throw your hands up high and shake those pants
The needle won't jump, the system pumps
Make the baddest in the field feel like suckers and chumps
Never call my bluff, don't sleep, I get rough
You can tell I'm hard as hell with a feminine touch
Spreadin like a vine, and I'ma grow on, and flow on
And so on, and so on, and so on
Stompin the world with marvellous hit after hit
Designed so you can dance to it
So get jumpin and pumpin, cause it's time to rejoice
Sweet Tee's on the mic, can't you tell by the sound of my voice?
Lettin you know one time in advance
You gotta get on the dancefloor and dance

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Get up and dance, is what I intended
If you're still in your seat, I'll be offended
Here to set it off, so those who think I'm soft
When I enter the room - break north
Rampagin, upstagin when in rage
I'm like a beast breakin out of his cage
Cause it's time to rhyme, get mine, can't take a resign
New jacks, hit the back of the line
Now you knowm get up, dance, so my show
Can flow, come on, you know, let's go
Dance in sweat, breakdown to the beat and let me
Turn it out, so you can never forget me
Sweet Tee at the t-o-p
Most definitely, gettin paid, g after g
To enhance, party people, put you in a trance
What I want you to do for me now, is dance

[ Chorus ]The first day that we met, it was love at first sight
You were my thoughts everyday and dreams every night
This was it and I knew it cause it felt so strong
In my heat and my soul that this love would be life long
But you were to fine and I was too blind to see all the games that you
Played with my mind
All the agony...baby can't you see (How could you do this to me?)
I asked you time and time was there someone else
You always said no thinking of yourself
Not that I'd be hurt or torn apart
Didn't make a difference if you broke my heart in two
Cause you knew how much I loved you
Everything you say, everything you do
I could go on and on and on like a chant
But to forgive you I just can't
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
But why did it have to be me

(CHORUS)
Why did it have to be me?
Please tell me why?
Why did it have to me?
Tell me, Tell me,tell me

You know it use to be great
Just you and me
You'd take my hand and we'd walk down by the sea
I remember when you asked me to be yours I said yes
Because without a doubt, I knew I had the best
You bought gold and diamonds, and furs
A car, a house with towels marked his and hers
You'd hold me so tight that I'd wanna pop
But then I'd whisper in your ear, don't stop
Things started changing, what did I do wrong
To have you pouring my heart into this love song
You'd leave in the evening, return in the morning
Say that you're tired, but you're not even yawning
You smell real good, but it's not your cologne
It's the scent of a perfume that I don't own
Now I know it wasn't meant to be
But why did it have to me

(CHORUS)
Please tell me why, why did it have to me
Please tell me why, Tell me, tell me (uhhh...hhh)
(repeat twice)

(Talking)
You know, one thing you'll learn is true
What you do to others will turn around and be done to you
It's the way The Almighty made it you see
Those who give pain will receive it eventually
Cause love is secrete, love is loving, love is love
It can't be replaced with anything you can think
But one day its gonna happen to you
The girl that you loved, she won't love you
Then you'll see how it feels when you can't eat meals
And you find out the heartaches are for real
Then you'll think about me
Just think about me
But don't call me
Because you'll be looking in the mirror and asking yourself
Why did it have to me?
Why me? Why me?[computerized voice]
