Ummmm, call it mystic stylez cause fly sytles so mystic bitch

(MC Mack)
The pimpin' mack is kickin' with the click that's known as Triple 6
Don't bar no lemon busta niggas we dont love 'em
In a trunk is where I stuff 'em
Suckas run they liquor I deliver nigga hollow thangs
Ain't got no feelings when im killin' cluckers busta duck for cover

Infared to ya head full of lead yawkin' lames
You can betcha by the dollar that I'm spittin' game
Niggas underestimate my pimpin' but mackin' but trippin' sprayin'
Layin' skanky bitches to the canvas and bustas can I man

(Koopsta Knicca)
Mystic Styles of the ancient mutalations
Torture chambers filled with corpses in my basement
Feel the wrath of the fuckin' devilition
Three 6 Mafia creation of Satan

(Gangsta Boo)
With my styles I slit
Yo body bitch
That I will chop to pieces
No fuckin' clue to da 5-0 click
No fuckin' witnesses an...
They only saw da mask of Jason that I had on my face
The scandalous bitch is so-so slick that why I got away safe
I blaze da bunt up in da air just to relax and get high
Da moon is full and all I see is 6-6-6 in da sky
The Three 6 Mafia
Tha devils daughter bitch is so wild
Whateva you bitches are doin' you cannot compare to my mystic style

(LaChat)
I'm creepin' up on these hoes with the muthafuckin' shotgun
A nigga wit tha 9's showin' these bitches they can't get none
Woopin' and dumpin' and stompin' and doggin' these bitches wit anamosity
Pimpin' and breakin' and cakin' these niggas
Cause these hoes can't fuck wit me
LaChat got tha gat
Creepin' up from tha back
Chrome tone now it's on
Neva love a nigga joan
Cause I'm a crazy bitch cuttin' off niggas dicks
Man ho takin' these niggas gotta keep it rich
Bitches be runnin' they mouth about this female they dont know about
Suckas be talkin' that shit I'm puttin' these funky niggas on da house

(Chruncy Black)
Mystic Styles in my head as I smoke on a blunt
Yo Crunchy Black da deamons child has a mean ass stun
I had to buck you off runnin' yo mouth with tha weak ass shit
You need to keep it closed
Trick before you get yo wig split
A candle light the demon night is what it have to be
Another problem for tha folks on Unsolved Mysteries
Ya thought I was dead
Naw instead I just faked on yo ass
And now I'm back wit that mask and I'm ready to blast

(Koopsta Knicca)
Now tell me somthing has emerged
Legions of demons

[For a date with my smith & wesson]

Niggas bout to break ya somethin' off up in that house of torture

Now ya lifes in danger

(Lord Infamous)
Evil...
Notice the murderous vocalist
Infamous rippin' up all of your ho shit
Approachin Da Scarecrow'll butchure and
Tearin' up niggas wit double edge
Lyrical thought as they go the lyrical legacy
Let the Lord Infamous light up da melody
Every nigga that try to compare with the
Triple 6 Mafia walkin' to therapy
When you walk throught the wilderness
Be very quiet Lord Infamous might be out stalkin'
I suggest you watch out for the voodoo cultures
Make up The Scarecrow is out there ya only for huntin'
Special thanks to my brother Bill Dunigan
Rest in Peace he taught me bout these mean streets
So therefore nigga you dont wanna come deal with the mafia
We'll drop you deep down beneath
The killa imperial black miracle from the bloody pacific
Scarecrow will flow to the end of infinity
With the style thats mystic

(Juicy "J")
Deep when we creep
Take yo last breath
Roll up yo tombstone
Smoke a blunt of death
Beware
The juice'll leave ya fuckin' hoes in terror
And scared of the Mystic Styles of them 3-6 devils
Who eva step up to this click then ya doomed
Cruel with my harpoon
Straight through yo heart fool
Soon I'll have you in tha trance
Swearin hearin' evil chants
Two knifes stuck down in my pants
Bustas do not stand a chance

(DJ Paul)
See Im'ma cold hearted killa like murderer Al Kapone
Strong as thousand mile winds quick to break ya bones
A Glock 19, 95 I cause ya early death
Ya walkin' Triple 6 streets so foo watch ya step
We all about makin' that cheese we gotta stay straight mane
Robbin' and workin' these hoes foo it ain't no thang
I even got virgins servin' for me in some otha nations
Pimpin' so hard that I got locked for some tax evasion
Killas & theves is all I ever had the pleasure to meet
A rusty ass tec 9'll make ya hit ya knee
I'm tryin to keep from blastin' off my muthafuckin' balls
By da one in da chamber of da Glock I got in my draws
I got my cap to the side
Watchin' my fuckin' back
My dogs across the street in the grass when I'm sweatin the track
Satan worshipper
The thug I be my profile read my file
I be enemy child for a while within' a Mystic Style

Not only a threat, I'm also the best
You gon' have to learn to accept it like death

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
Which one of you fuck niggas wanna test me
Real gone, will be, they will call the police
Sirens off, keep this bitch up out this ho
I had to show [?]
North Memphis beatdown, caught em on the rebound
Death Tone, Funky Town, right now gun sound
Dead men, broke bars, more to get pulled apart
Koopsta too hard, my god, body parts, body parts

[Verse 3: Skinny Pimp]
Chrome 40 mag, when you got 'em stuck
Ran through the hood, then you ran for the door
Got a whole lot of bands but it's not for sale
Real street niggas don't hide here
Ducking and dodging the cops and shit
[?]
But it bounce right back at big Mafia six
They can't keep Skinny Pimp in this bitch
With DJ Paul, Gangsta Boo, Scarecrow, Crunch' and Koop
We breaking the law, damn they down my door, it's a fact y'all
We turning it up, put to hood [?]
All of us gots a plug
Niggas ain't got no money but still trying to fuck with us

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
And I got that thang changed, I hope you ready for what has begun
Dumped all this body parts in my trunk, and I did that there just for fun
Mom told me a long time ago "The respect will come", and it's finally here
I got blonde hair [?] blood is that pure
Now I'm all the way gone ho when you need this shit
Get blessed like you done sneezed or some shit
I'm starting a new religion and The Scarecrow will be my beacon bitch
Mafia for life with me, my third I will always see a six
I'm fully involved will all of this, it's Lil Wyte till I'm deceased bitch

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I'm all about my business, I'm all about my bread
Shoot these motherfuckers head in the head
I'mma make sure all you motherfuckers dead
Catch a nigga slipping, hit him with the bat
Duct-Duct tape them, that's what I said
Check from over there, look up under the bed
All a nigga came for was motherfucking bread
Mafia Six in this motherfucking bitch

[Verse 6: La Chat]
La Chat bitch, I'm wrecking shit
Bitch talking, texting and shit

Lips still in my game mane, right hand's my gun hand
Fucked up, we getting fucked up, that bull shit, fuck you say?
Bodies we be slaying, fuck you we dump them in your trunk
No remorse for all these haters, run them down like Forest Gump
Crestwood is my hood, and I rep it all day
I'm the madest desert eagle till the twos wanna play

[Verse 7: Project Pat]
Pat'aahh
Chopper on the floor, work on the stove
Loud to my lips, smoke out my nose
All these bands, I be jugging on my hustle, on my pan
You get fucked up little pussy with my fingers on this hand
Cut the grass like a lawnmower, like a rake
Faught you niggas like Django, quick as a snake
Anything for the money, [?]
With the pistols upside your head I'm like death checkmate
Project like the Rolexs and them Breitlings
Duffel bag full of motherfucking dead white meat
Told your bitch pussy [?]
But I smashed on the ass like [?]

[Verse 8: Locodunit]
Ready for 09's, ain't got a role model
You fuck with my high, you're not going to roll right
Breaking two gold bottles, hang with the real
Chill with the real rockers, killers and pill poppers
We cuffing that shit and them niggas that steal choppers
Fuck you feel about this? Real lane
Scale-A-Ton tatted from my arm, drawn in my palms
Kush inbetween my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
Dump all the body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you when I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine, I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it, let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it, let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rest might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia Six, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition, coalition
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Mix me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: JGRXXN]
Monkey ass niggas sit banana clips (aye)
And water niggas 'bout to make me click (them)
Fucking with the Six catch a hot tip
I never go, never without my click
Ana for you niggas to the grizzle
And niggas think they superman, so you can get your issue
Six million ways to put them in the trunk
JGreen on the scene, put the body parts in dump

[Verse 11: Kokoe (DJ Paul)]
I’m the hardest Mexican, out of west L.A
Talk that shit your body end up in the fucking bay
All I listen to is Eazy and N.W.A
Now I'm riding with the Mafia, homie here to spray
Numb killers, drug dealers, cap-pealers
And hoes that never catch feelings
Cut the check, I cut your neck, put you in a body bag
Because your boy never ever ever have respect for a snitch
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah bitch (Don't want it)
Nah, nah, nah, nah (Don't want it)
(Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', Scale-A-Ton out the kitch', you don't want nothing bitch)

[Verse 12: Lord Infamous]

The ammo enter front then it coming out the back of ya
I gotta get your goon, skin his brain while I'm stabbing ya
[?]
Put on the gas and light up'll make your ass combust
I am Lord Infamous, I do not take prisoners
Mission to enter you, decrease your temperature
Serial killer, wicked voodoo minister
Scorpion sometimes Dr. Kevorkian
Shoot you in the porcelain, and give me [?]
Ghetto went corporate, Illuminati ornament

[Verse 13: Gangsta Boo]
All these fake ass hoes in my face, we ain't cool
But back with the Six, now I'm getting the bitches [?]
Unexpected gather, bitches shaking
We would like you shot your own self in the basement
Rule up in Memphis, so I'm kinda crazy

Hashtag that shit, put them at the real Boo

[Verse 14: DJ Paul]
Yeah, the Chump is here

I put your head on a secret, I make you start bleeding
I leave your ass stinking without me even fucking blinking
I'm harder than hard, don't fuck with the god
I come from a part where niggas don't starve, where niggas they in
Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hit in
I leave them leaking, and that there is a bad end
My gun don't give a fuck about illegal when I pull the trigger
It don't care if you even a fucking nigga
This pussy shit is unacceptable, don't test my testicles
I'm pointing [?], and leaving you niggas vegetables
With being Francis Jackson is the only way I got two faces
Had them sharp bullets going up and taking two faces
Niggas got my name on their tongue like they shoe laces
I lace you niggas with revolver bullets and leave no traces
Leave them up [?], mouth full of civil well
Put the price on your head, now my goons are millionaire
[?]
I don't give a fuck about care, so I never care
I'm a millionaire so the traphouse like [?]
Nah I'm lying, I still celebrate
A gun from the hip, so I still sell a bitch
Run around in a row with my nose in that shit, trick
With hella guns, big guns, you really want some?

And I bum on these bitches [?]
Where the fuck I'm coming from [?]

Do or die .45 at your temple Your life done refuse in a bucket
So fuck it you stuck wid a villain and finish yourself
Too a nigga life Tommy Wright full ah lead, bloodshed
Leave a nigga in his deathbed scared
Gangfight, came hype, make a nigga hang tight, lay and die
Ship him then crypt him like, stay in fright
As I creep finna get paid tearin' up shit like a renegade
Lookin' like there been a raid, campin', kidnap a prankster
Lock him in the trunk, don't resist or ya bitch'll get sprayed
In the face wid a buckshot hot bullets penetrate demonstrate Tommy Wright
Don't play
Shells, poppin' from the gun comin' Uzi weigh a tonne

Memories ah smoked out, loc'd out, funked out as them demons dance
Playas lookin' wild so high style, devil's in me so
Fly can get so violent but so silent when I'm on that blow
Enhance my skill, make me trill
Trill enough to kill at will
Will I kill you?, Fly will peel you
Off the map that's all so real
Don't you mothersuckas often wonder what to call this shit
Busta claimin' Mystic Stylez Lil Fly call it playa shit
Pimpin' be a, playa be a, Funkytown's way down to kill
You can call it Junkytown, consequence your crown we peel
Any ho will never be, anyway so clean to me
Gangsta type is comin' three and four see ever down wid me[Intro]
Geah! Wit'cha man La Chat
Yeah, uhh, stick em up
Stick em up, stick em up

[Hook]
Pull up in the old school with the hubcaps
Got my black tee, ones, and my skull cap
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)
I ain't come to play, and I ain't come to laugh
All I gotta say is nigga put it in the bag
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)

[Gucci Mane]
You know the procedure, when you see a heater
Bullets rippin at'cha, got you runnin like a cheetah
Rob in my black tee, mob in my black V
Robbed the weed man, cause the nigga tried to tax me
Ye ain't gotta ask me, tell me where the stacks be
Hittin big licks got me ballin like an athelete
Used to take Starter coats, moved up to bigger dope
Down for a kick do', just to make my wrist glow
Steal from the rich, but I hang with the po' folk
Ball 'til ya fall, but don't ball 'til ya go broke
Gucci Mane, La Chat, we in and out the trap fast
Leavin out your house, thirty birds in my bookbag

[Hook]

[La Chat]
Okay, check that bitch
Wake up early in the mornin, looking for a victim
The first nigga look like dollars tryin to holla I'm gon' get him
Ain't got no time for relationships, I'm out to get that cheese
Even if I have to kill you bitch my son I got to feed
I'm at the mall I'm poppin tags with shopping bags so style
I found a duck that I can pluck, that nigga that asked me out
Whoa~! Hold up my nigga you must don't know I gotta get'cha
You told yo boy I got a big ass, but boy my nine is bigger
I'm waitin on him to pull up at the spot I see he clean
That boy sittin on them thangs, a iced out chain, and big ass rangs
He said let's go to the movies, I told him let's go to the room
This nigga think he really got a freak, but mind is 'Do the fool'
We get to the room, I let him rub, I let him get a lil' touch
I told him hold up stop, let me go to the bathroom freshen up
I went out the bathroom window, met with Gucci, Glock in purse
Kicked in the do', shot him in his head, took his cheese and left him murked
I'm that bitch!

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
They say that I'mma cutthroat, Gucci never cut coke
Yea I'mma jack boy, known to run a drug sto'
Hang wit the thug boys, nicknamed the Goon Squad
First you gotta sign up, then you get your goon card
Niggas scared to fuck with me, don't wanna serve me
Shop wit ya Wednesday, take from ya Thursday
Splurge wit my comrades, Gucci Mane I'm hood rich
Nigga kill for ya if you just buy him a outfit
Think like a mob boss, move like warranty
Got a half a mill' safe, just to keep the bills paid
Burn 'em with a hot fork, tazer on his nutsacs
I ain't come to play man I came to find them big stacks

You can call Mrs. Serv On, cause I get my hustle on
Looking for some donkey kong, got me blowing up my phone
So you wanna get along, got no money but you (?)
I'mma break you off a crumb, leave me in the early morn'
Always trapped up with a tone, Always shoot you when you gone
All you robbers got me wrong, I will show up at yo' home
Gotta make my money job, Fuck wit me and you'll be gone
Always striking for they call, La' Chat gotta make it known
I be bout' that money mayn, For the top is where I am
I don't play no looser games, Niggas always say my name
Shit I be the one to blame, When they ain't to booming thangs
In these streets they got to fight, Mayn you know I can't be lien'
Always strugglin' for they chains, Try my best to maintain
Watch them shoot it in they thang, It be throbbin' in the brain
I be causing plenty pain, (?)
Servin to much cocaine, Theya'll gone love me when I'm game

Catch me on the corner still, Cause I'm out to make a mill'
Niggas thinkin' that I'm heavy, Cause I'm ridin in there chevy

I'm a bitch about that skrilla, Got more work than half you niggas
Just to keep it on the realla, I'm a buy a drug dealer
Thuggin' on yo' fuckin block, Keep my eye up on the narks
I ain't tryin to make it hot, So I get from spot to spot
Got to keep my 9 on me, Always ready fo' some heat
I don't know if you got beef, It's so hot out in the streets
But this how I choose to live, Thanks the lord to be forgived
This is how I pay my bills, This is how I eat a meal
I would give it up one day, When that day I can not say
Cause I feel I'm livin' straight, Slangin' dope what keep me paid

Steady popping bottles screaming "Nothing is a problem"
Living with yo mama, that's why you ain't got one
Get on your grown man, pull up your pants too
Smelling like a pound of weed and a tennis shoe
We independent women standing on our own two
You can't sell us dreams, show us whatcha gonna do
No pointless chit chatter, I came in here strictly
To let them niggas know that I am the bitchy bitchy

[Hook (2X)]

If any fool make me mad I'll turn into a creep
I‘m lifted off some drugs, and I‘m violent as can be

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
And I got that thang changed, I hope you ready for what has begun

We cuffing that shit and them niggas that steal choppers
Fuck you feel about this? Real lane
Scale-A-Ton tatted from my arm, drawn in my palms
Kush inbetween my index and my thumb, exhale from my lungs
Load the Tommy Gun, split the tongues, kill them one by one
Dump all the body parts into my trunk

[Verse 9: Point Blank]
Didn't give a fuck about yesterday, don't give a fuck today
And tomorrow I'm probably going to feel the same fucking way
They love you when I hit it, hate me when I miss it
So much yack in system you can smell it when I'm pissing
I smoke like a broke down engine, I love my money like I love my women
Let me show you how to whip it, let me show you how to pack it
Let me show you how to sell it, let me show you how to stack it
Pillow talking with these rest might get you excited
But don't let the pillow talk get you green lighted
Now I'm in the mix with the Mafia Six, but I breathe H-Town
I'mma die coalition, coalition
Told you once, told you a million motherfucking times
I'm like a shredder, don't get caught up in my fucking grind
Mix me with that shit, it's the wrong night
Body parts, hope it's them bitch niggas I don't like

[Verse 10: JGRXXN]
Monkey ass niggas sit banana clips (aye)
And water niggas 'bout to make me click (them)
Fucking with the Six catch a hot tip

Six million ways to put them in the trunk
JGreen on the scene, put the body parts in dump

[Verse 11: Kokoe (DJ Paul)]
I’m the hardest Mexican, out of west L.A
Talk that shit your body end up in the fucking bay
All I listen to is Eazy and N.W.A
Now I'm riding with the Mafia, homie here to spray

And hoes that never catch feelings
Cut the check, I cut your neck, put you in a body bag
Because your boy never ever ever have respect for a snitch
Nah bitch (Don't want it)

I'm harder than hard, don't fuck with the god
I come from a part where niggas don't starve, where niggas they in
Don't give a fuck about friends, them niggas hit in

My gun don't give a fuck about illegal when I pull the trigger
It don't care if you even a fucking nigga
This pussy shit is unacceptable, don't test my testicles
I'm pointing [?], and leaving you niggas vegetables
With being Francis Jackson is the only way I got two faces
Had them sharp bullets going up and taking two faces
Niggas got my name on their tongue like they shoe laces
I lace you niggas with revolver bullets and leave no traces
Leave them up [?], mouth full of civil well
Put the price on your head, now my goons are millionaire

I don't give a fuck about care, so I never care
I'm a millionaire so the traphouse like [?]
Nah I'm lying, I still celebrate
A gun from the hip, so I still sell a bitch

Scandalous handle it as I commence in the sun and the spirits

Do or die .45 at your temple Your life done refuse in a bucket
So fuck it you stuck wid a villain and finish yourself
Too a nigga life Tommy Wright full ah lead, bloodshed
Leave a nigga in his deathbed scared
Gangfight, came hype, make a nigga hang tight, lay and die
Ship him then crypt him like, stay in fright
As I creep finna get paid tearin' up shit like a renegade
Lookin' like there been a raid, campin', kidnap a prankster
Lock him in the trunk, don't resist or ya bitch'll get sprayed
In the face wid a buckshot hot bullets penetrate demonstrate Tommy Wright
Don't play
Shells, poppin' from the gun comin' Uzi weigh a tonne

Enhance my skill, make me trill
Trill enough to kill at will
Will I kill you?, Fly will peel you
Off the map that's all so real

(Juicy J)
There's a freak in north Memphis that rollin' & smokin' goodie

Her wreckin' be a dog, a hog, or just a bully
It's cool if she be down to clown, cause she'll pull it
Don't underestimate her face, she ain't a rookie
And when she get in deep and deep, the ho be trippin'
A gangsta type bitch that make ya say (oowwee!)
She lick my balls, ba-ba balls, I banged and freaked her pussy

(Frayser Boy)
Now I'm drankin' on this cortisone that's gots me feelin' frisky
Lookin' fo a freaky ho to suck up on my dicky
Needs a pro, and not an amateur so I come licky
Number one drop flick and sucks the dick to end this quickly
Sucks me dumb, and gots me sprung, and leaves it wit a hickey
If you gots the bitch then I don't know he's coming? fit me (frayser boy)
If you lookin' fo the ho, don't bother cause she's wit me
The bitch was born to use her tongue, he nigga's name was Vicky

Chorus (8x)

(La Chat)
A head huntin' bitch that's on a mission, lookin' for the head

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I take my hoes to islands, so they call me Gilligan
A gangster but a gentleman, seldom wearing Timberlands
Chameleon, Brazilian, Amphibian, Reptilians
Order fettuccine cuz I'm dining with Sicilians
Lobster tail, shrimp scampi, and calamari
Jumping out Ferraris with the ...(?)
I'm selling birds dirty, plus the mids sell good
$1500 so your girl can say I smell good
Scented candles, incense burning when I take a shower
I'd rather rot in prison before I go out like a coward
I top 3 G's, he make $10 an hour
I ain't hatin' shawty, but know you can do without him
Manicured nails, I keep pedicured feet
Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant couldn't swag like me
Bet you Tiger Woods can't pull the hoes that I've pulled
Give me two blue dolphins and a couple Red Bulls

[Verse 2: La Chat]
(?)[Juicy J]
Now I ain't the one with the magic wa wa wand
But I can break a bitch for the cheese and funds
I don't have to use a gun or even make the ho cum
If a nigga go to jail then a bitch make bond
While you shakin dat ass in the shake ja joint
I be sittin in the back rollin big blun blunts
Let me know when you off to collect my mon'
If a nigga can't get it then a nigga will haul
Cause playas like me don't see nuttin funny
Bitch betta have my mutherfuckin money
Black eyes and bruisin up a face I den done it
To let her know these bonified pimps who run it
She make a G a night but she told me 200
But thats what I get fuckin wit a snow bunny
I told her like this ask dat nigga you be callin
Police found a body that very next morning

Chorus 1 (2x)
Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes

Keep the money not folded in a roll

When I see you bitch you betta have my dough
Like a pimp
Reach Back

[Juicy J]
They wanna wear my shoes they wanna wear
My clothes they wanna ride round thru the
Hood with 20 hoes
Sittin back in the back
Like a nigga suspose
With a chauffer drivin
Lettin his pimpin be choose
I can walk the walk and I can talk the talk
Bring yo girl to my room mane thats all you saw
Young nigga in the cut name Juicy J
Nigga skin black as dark like ebay
All these freaks cross the world they don't want to holla
If you ain't got 20's if you ain't got dollars
Bitch fuck that shit we still gon pimp
We go ride thru the streets we go hit the dense
We gon' smoke on dem blunts we gon' sip a fifth
We gon' stand on the corner wit a pistol grip
If you want to holla at us we ain't out for the squeeze
All we want is yo purse cause we out for the cheese

Chorus 1

[La Chat]

Nigga wanna fuck but for what you ain't gave enough
Betta hit the strip slang dick cause a nigga bust
La Chat smokin on a sack like a real mack
Sittin back countin all my ends checkin all traps
Claimin you won't go thats a damn lie

Choose your weapons
But boy choose them carefully
Each of my poisons

And this is your therapy
You can have one

Bump off bounty
Place all his pieces
All over county
The shit's very lethal
That I place in the needle
Prepare you for your last trip
To the Cathedral

And all them Lexus on lock

I see why them bitches hot
You hoes is strugglin' and starvin'
And wanna rise in the hood
It's cold I'm crankin' up heat
And you wish you could
Y'all wish y'all could get back with us
Then maybe then you could shine
Like the rappers you wish you was
And get off the grind
I'm keepin' one in the chamber
Because I'm filled up with anger
And when I see yo little ho 'n'
You knowin' your life's in danger
I do a show y'all in the burough
Hollerin' no kind of shit
Is that the best way that you know
To get attention lil bitch
I understand how they feel
They feelin' that they left out
And we the ones movin' on
So we the ones talked about
But niggas keep it your best
And one day then you'll get a crown
But until then do a hit of coke
And keep feelin' down
Cause suckaz... that's real

Ummmm, call it mystic stylez cause fly sytles so mystic bitch

[Lord Infamous]
Infamous I'm leavin brain dust

I put some shit up in the line that'll blow ya mind
It's like some Colt 45, does it every time, nigga get my rhymes

Chorus: Fiend

If I pull my pistol I'm a bust wit it
Never see me holdin it and go fuss wit it

[Serv-on]
Act like you know me when I say Im head thug on your block
Hold ya breath when I spray paint my name on yo spot
Tell your self you ain't scared when I run in your shit
I ain't bout no games woady its your life or yo bitch
Apologize when I pass by bootin my grill

Forget yo know me when I pistol whip you and yo click
No limit riders, Tre 6, yall ain't runnin like this

[DJ Paul]
Now whats the fuck the use of holdin a gun and playin wit you foes

And I bet all them hoes quit talkin shit

[Hook 2x's]

[Juicy J]
I never ran up yo a trunk
Blastin on a fuckin punk
Toxicated, high, or drunk
Try and grab the closest pump
Never flodged on how I lived
Fight a nigga over a bitch
Playa Im just callin pimp
Always keep a cigarette lit
Never walked up in the club
Dissin niggas wit a mug
Always keep my owm sack
Never wanted to hit your bud
Independant on you hoes
Makin more than selling dope
If you wanna hate the click
Nigga I make your body froze

[Serv-on]

Close yo eyes ?
Mouth full its a south thang thuging like that
You say you know Im in North Memphis pushin that drill
Tearin clubs up in South Memphis and Smokey City
Say your prayers when I lay that iron clean on yo chest
Dont play no games boy, Im kinda wild wit that tech
Pretend you death when I scream what city you clame
Fuck around wit me I seperate your body from your name

[La Chat]

Lay down bitch ,La Chat and I ain't playing no games
Bucking you hoes,my motto keep my distance from lames
My 45 be on my side and I be ready to ride
We catch you slipin you be missin have you barried alive
My niggas downdown we got that anna that you bitches dont won't
Step to me wrong Paul,Juicy,Pat,La Chat be strapped wit them pumps
Now how you figure when you fuck up that we gone let you live
We kill your ass then set a randsome fo your guts that we spill!!!!!

[Hook][Hook: Fefe Dobson]
Hail Mary, quite contrary
How does your hatred grew?
With skin of snake and rabid bait we're going straight to hell
Rosemary, bloody cherries
What does your crystal show?
Bloody rates and bloody faith, you’re going straight to hell

[Verse I: Gangsta Boo]
This shit that I’m cooking you be better working
Cause its wicked and now when I play with you hoes
This shit is witch brew
My attitude is fuck you, you know
Had to bring it one more time
I love to make my haters sick
Laughing out loud, rolling with cheddar
My niggas is down with triple the six
Paying attention suppose to be gossiping
Constantly keeping my name in they mouth
Blowing and smoking I'm travelling getting my money
The hardest La Boo in the South
Industry dudes make me sick sometime
Be acting like your shit don't stick like mine
But the nigga I roll with his ass is awesome
Fuck your opinion, I don’t wanna be bothered
Everybody knows that real G's move in silence
Everybody knows that broke necks don't tell
Everybody knows the possibility of violence
Everybody knows they don't want to see me click
Most of the time in the studio fresh
Cooking up poison
Pulling their heads
Getting some hay
Counting them stacks
Highly upgraded two bitches attest my gangsta
Hollow tips got you red splitter splatter
Like a painter
I don’t wanna be like her
I wanna be like him
I need bitch, no thank ya
My crystal ball and I’m the queen
Bitch bow down
I have the will power to shut your whole world down

[Hook]

[Verse II: La Chat]

You know it's murder
You know I'm murking these bitches
Mayne, fuck the feds
But can I embalm these snitches
Got to get your friends
They about your business
Bust your head living in these ditches
Murk your family, don't need no witness
Check the bitch the assassin menace
Wouldn't want to play with this video game
Got the gang numbers first and you can get it up with me
Got the cop killers on stand-by
Do a drive-by
Make your mama cry-cry
Nigga buy red dye on your black eye
You will die if you are trying looking at my guy
You will lie blood across the face so high
In the sky real bitches make the moon mine
Niggas die anything that I want nigga
I could buy everybody hey check bitch
And that's why every morning that I wake up
Looking I'm waking up look at the mirror
Laugh at my set because I the one they fear her
Up another [?]
And she's still talking shit but nobody hear her
Put her in the trunk with the pump to her head
Got her scared mislead she been bleed on the grave
Fuck her own partner, bitch won't tell the bitch she dead
Another day, Imma buy a new Luger
You niggas shoot her
Mama taught to kill or be killed, I'm the tutor
So if you hoes gonna get some up your ass gotta gun
Me an Boo we gonna bring this shit to ya
I'm ratchet
Nigga break you and your papi
Me and major rhyme moves
We got the lose got the tunes
If you snooze I'm trigger happy

[Hook][Chorus 8x: Crunchy Blac]
Ain't no nigga gonna play wit me

[Verse 1: La Chat]

[Verse 2: Crunchy Blac]
