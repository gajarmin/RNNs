[Intro: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, up, word?
Now you done fucked up

[Hook x2: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, chain swings like nunchucks
She gon' chew you up, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wile'd up, soldiers at a ten hut
Look what you done done, now you done fucked up

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Read my lips, I do my own stunts
Bitch wanna go on a date, pull up to SunTrust
Wear my hat to the front, like I drive a truck
Like I drive a truck, all white Bentley truck
ATM go nuts, I do what I want
I say what I want, I grew up on Pac
Kush smell just like musk, turn it into dust
Man, my style is tough, y'all huffed all that puff
Twerk like she from Russia, try hard not to love her
But she so damn bad, I might have to cuff her
Rock like Billy Ray, that's a nigga idol
Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes, read it like the Bible

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Up like Trump, all of the sudden
Solo cup when brought to the public
Balmain's clean as a whistle, green ain't the issue
Lil bit of money make a difference, nothin' is somethin'
It's so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck y'all assumption, my blood still rushin', my heart still thumpin'
Up like Trump, kickin' like Ike, got a bitch twerkin' on Skype
MGM every night, Sremm after dark, king of the swipe
Motherfuckers worry 'bout likes on they pictures
They ain't got an equal dollar, or a nickel
They ain't even got a penny, for the strippers
And they wanna pop bottles, like winners
Check my pedigree I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin' rings, I'm shinin', like a fuckin' king
Breakin' down the kush, don't it look so plush?
Take a couple puffs, up like Donald Trump!

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that Louis store

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. wrists moving, cooking, getting to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, two everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]
It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl
I might switch it up and get your girl

[Hook]

[Outro: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]
Deuce and Ye
We like Snoop and Dre
Isn't this your birthday, baby
You deserve a coupe today
(You in first place, you in first place)
(Bad bitch contest you in first place)[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Squad goin' up, nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some tings, one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Verse 2: ILoveMakonnen]
Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn 'bout what she think

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
Got the club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

[Bridge: ILoveMakonnen]
And it ain't no way no, how I made it on my own
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta' go, you're moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]

[Hook] x4
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy

[Verse]
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think

[Hook] x4

[Bridge]
It ain't no way no how
I made it on my own, I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay, you know I gotta go
You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

[Hook] x4[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Hook] (x2)
I got the gas and the coke
I don't sell molly no more
I keep the white and the green
And it gotta be a pint if you looking for the lean

[Verse 1]
OG pimping, trench coat mobbing
Money keep flowing from the bity to Bompton
West coast Makonnen, the best thing going
They really like my movies, it's the best thing showing
Boss Hogg playing, competition slaying
Sell the whole pack then relax before the day end
Making hella, mula', give a damn about your jeweler
Shouts out west Baltimore and free young moolah

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Haters can't see us, Nish or Taniya
We be in L.A. posting like the coliseum
Big smoking, PCH coasting
Sherantino Hotel, pent house toasting
When Straw-ber-ita dreams turn to champagne reality
Old friend been down since New Life Academy
Now we bound to the dough, it all make sense
Own our own homes we ain't gotta pay rent

[Hook] (x4)[Intro: Seinfeld]
So you're the balloon, you've got that helium, and we travel with you through the string. So we're going up there with you even though we're on the ground. We can't fly, I can't sing, I can't make music, but I can get a-- I can buy it. So I can get a balloon. I can't fly, but I can get a helium balloon

[Verse 1]
I used to put my faith in the yarn, and now communication is gone
I agree we've gone distant, my new location the charts
Naw, mm, can't count the days, but let's just say five
Years, coming of age, it make you blow by your day job
So cry for me, wild for me
It's a horror story, eyes 20/20s that I-M-E your normal C
And I'd be different gettin' diplomas in peace
But gettin' applause and across, I'm hittin' Diplo for a beat
Slight work to Dahi, it's a purpose y'all see
In a world of dopplegangers, niggas ain't worth the copy
You capiche? You got me cold
Niggas'll fly you up this high, won't let you fly to the moon
Goin' up!

[Verse 2]
They love your moves made 'til you make moves
Achievin' new feats every few 8 shoes
16, took a nigga dream different
Had SOBs lookin' like it's new Supreme in it
See that the line's been beastin'
The main attraction, I got 'em hangin' their cleats up
I've been keepin' it G
It's levels to this fellow, hello, I resemble the cheat codes
Some shit good, some shit flop
Some love to see you blow, they don't want see you pop
Shit good, some shit nah
Some shit recycled like second timers in Tour de France
First you picked up, now you picked apart
You get too far 'til your core fans au revoir
They like, "You stuck with us, cause you let him fly"
Swear this life is like a helium balloon, I'm sorry
But I gotta fly

[Interlude: Jerry Seinfeld]
Now when a kid gets a helium balloon, he's holding that string and he's keeping this balloon from going anywhere. But he also wants to let it go

[Verse 3]
Gave you a contract, stay true through all that
Came through with Ross, writin' bangers for y'all
But I ain't lose my content, fuck all that nonsense
Diverse with rappin', I'm a writer with passion
Tell the purist that laugh I don't reach out for daps
Cause "No Hands" triple platinum
Better writings for retail, why not see my detail?
Gettin' box office spins, only box I fit in is by thigh on a female
So they hatin' me for that, sayin' I just make women songs
It's perfect style, every versatile got me right where her walls at
Still know what my core needs, so fuck who ignores me
'For I need niggas, I'll purchase three mirrors
And show y'all what's for me

[Interlude: Jerry Seinfeld]
So he wants to let it go and he wants to catch it. Eventually he loses it, he doesn't want to lose it

[Bridge:  Magazeen]
Why they give a fuck about the songs I write?
As long as my thugs and my fans them nice
Movin' forward with my life
Crucify me, man of Jesus Christ
Nah do no more favor
Cause 'nough of them are traitor
Them a real back-biter
Them a try take your glory and your energy
Buffalo soldier
Selassie tell them man a gangster
And mi no see no boy me 'fraid of
Them are try take your glory and your energy

[Outro]
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever
Wanna see me good or never see me better?
Fuck 'em, can't say nothin'
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you
Fuck 'em, you ain't sayin' nothin'
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever
Wanna see me good but never see me better?[Intro: Que]
Young rich nigga made a milli off swiping
Seen it come and go like a motherfucking psychic

[Bridge: Quavo]
Hundred band juug, young nigga had to snatch it
Young rich nigga made a milli off of trapping
Young nigga playing with Mariah like Nick Cannon
All my goons young, I know I'm a money savage

[Hook: Quavo] (x2)
Young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, I stay with the pistols
I hang with drug dealers, gorillas and killers

[Verse 1: Que]
Young rich nigga made a milli off swiping
Seen it come and go, like a motherfucking psychic
Brand new chopper with the beam, no license
Try to steal my cash that bitch gon bite like Mike Tyson
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, I stay with the pistols
I hang with drug dealers, gorillas, pill flippers and killers
I chill in the slum, concede with my plug
I made a mil using my skillet
Get lean by the tub, I'll show you some love
You cop some and get a free pigeon

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I'm a drug dealer, got killas will kill ya
They do what I say it's no issue
Young nigga, my young niggas strapped with them pistols
They hit ya, yo momma gone miss you
Them bullets gone kiss you, my diamonds official
Like a referee with a whistle
Get 20K just for a picture
You buy the drank, I buy the pitcher
I see you pull up in that rental
You stashing them bricks in the fender
You got a trap house in the gate
The security posted, it say "do not enter"
Young nigga don't care 'bout your pistol
Young niggas they don't care who with you
I'm posted, ain't gotta do nothing
My young niggas hungry, I send em to hit you

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Hanging with the drug dealers, nigga I am a real killer
Bullets the same size as missiles
Nigga you can come get your issue
I know that you softer than tissue
I know that my bullets gone hit you
My niggas got arms, they trap in the slums
Of Atlanta and Iraq and I know it's so dumb
Hundred rounds, call it Drumma Boy
Got a big ass tank, call it Tonka toy
Nah you don't want no drama boy
I'll eat a nigga ass like an Almond Joy
My nigga, my nigga, my nigga
My nigga, I don't want to hit you
I call my goons, you clear the room
My niggas come through and then let out a boom

[Bridge + Hook][Chorus: Offset]
I’m a rich nigga
You’re a broke nigga
Should've had a pussy you a ho nigga
If the police call a nigga I don’t know nigga
Why the fuck you talkin to me like you know a nigga
Drop out of high school just to hit some licks
When I walk into the mall they wanna take a pic
All teachers told me I wouldn't make it
Now I'm rich
I wanna be the bigger trapper with a 100 bricks

100 bricks,100 bricks,100 bricks
100 bricks,100 bricks,100 bricks

Space ship, dope money
Got that trunk filled with that pack from the west
Got the ? on my neck
Offset's on the vet

40. Cal on the search
Shoot 'em down like a bird
Hundred birds fly south let my niggas break 'em down
Niggas talking bout its ready get it in and get it out
? On the load
Coming through the checkpoint
Don't make it then i'll probably lay a pussy nigga down
Blue bricks in the wrist in the shit
Gotta brick off a split
I was broke, now I'm fixed
Put my niggas in the mix
Now they running with the bricks
With the bricks and the sticks
Tryna get a hundred bricks
Unload 'em off the palette
Put em in the alley
Shit gets tragic when your fuckin' with a package
They put em in the trap then they put em in baggage
Then they get gone like a nigga never had it
Abracadabra like I know magic
Like Houdini with bricks, I do it fantastic
Hundred bricks put em in the trap, nigga
Hundred bricks put em on a map!

[Chorus: Offset]

[Verse 2: Offset]
I got a plug up in Cali
Got green like it's salad
Feeling low with the money
I had a marriage
You used to have babies
But you lost your baby,you had a miscarriage
Look at my watch, its got so many carats
Got birds in my kitchen, got pigeons got parrots
Got bombs on me, you think i'm a terrorist
I pull up in Phantom ghost it is scary
Got a bitch cooking dope she a Brazilian
Stayed in the kitchen got me a whole million
Giuseppe walking alligator amphibian?
I came from the trap and the dope will stay ignorant
I talk to El Chapo he send me some tacos
I went to the lot and bought me a ?
I'm a street nigga go check out my bio
I got so much money you think I hit the lotto
Im a supplier, before you set foot in my trap
I check you looking for the wire
I beat the empire
My plug on a boat like a pirate
If you running up on me imma start up a riot
Im cooking up fish nigga, it's time to eat it
Bon appetite, have a feast
My bitch just landed from Greece
Red bottoms under her feet
I'm loving that bitch cause her daddy got keys!

[Chorus: Offset]

[Verse 1]
I’m sick of these niggas, I’m tired of these niggas
I do not fuck with a lot of these niggas
Gangster hitters, I be with gorillas
Strapped and they ready, you want it you get it
Please do not play with my paper, you finished
Patience is short but them choppers extended
My youngins they thuggin’, they smoking, they fucking
They still out to get it but facing a sentence
Fuck do you phonies be talking about
You do not know what that drama’s about
Make you a promise, I promise to ride
Streets is a struggle, I’m tryna survive
Look the bitches, the money we getting
Champagne that we sipping and foreigns to drive
I pull up on em and shit on your lawn
On my paper say owner, you know that it’s mine
I’m ready for beef just to capitalize
Rappers are petty, they pussy, vajin
Turn your little block to a vacated sign
They get to shooting like red line
Tony Montana, the crib in Atlanta
Thinking bout copping the Wraith or the Phantom
Jump on the jet in my fucking pajamas
Shout out my niggas 100 forever
All my lil niggas are still on probation
My [?] just caught him a charge, I’m praying he dodge immigration
He say fuck it’s PO and he still on them papers
And he just bought him a chopper, he told me it come with a laser

[Hook]
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
We can make a movie
Shooters, my shooters
Yeah we down to do you
Watch how you maneuver

[Verse 2]
I'm getting tired of tellin' you niggas
Don’t do the zoo, but I know some gorillas
Catch me a body on beats I’m a killer
Flow like a chopper that shot up a villa
Boy don’t forget me, I be with the sinners
I am a vet and you such a beginner
Bitch I run the summers and stunt in the winters
See 90 percent of your shit ain’t remembered
I’m back in this bitch and aim straight at your chest
Kick in the door till I get my respect
Heard the new music, it made me depressed
Free all my niggas that call me collect
We be the business, the lord as my witness
I’m way too committed, no time for them bitches
Shout out Ms. Simmons, you know you can get it
I’m the building, them shooters attending
Like knowledge, we ready for war
Nigga was young when I jumped off the porch
Gave up the tigers and now want the Porsche
Once I got right then my mama divorced
Play with my people, I show no remorse
Throw on my jewelry then show up to court
Crib is so big it look like a resort
Nigga we made it, I’m faded of course
Fuck all these niggas, we fucking they bitch
Hate when they act like they bout it, I guess they just want some attention
Don’t let my humbleness fool you nigga
Call up my niggas to call up they niggas to do you nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
All of my niggas 100 forever
I'll be that nigga 100 forever
Shout out my bitch is 100 forever

Ridin round, gettin it', gettin' money like there's two of me
Two bad bitches, and they talkin' 'bout doin' me
Get them to the crib, and they don't know what to do with me
I tell 'em, suck me at the same time, like there's two of me!
Too legit to quit, they can't touch me on my hammer shit
Too many choices, hella Porsches don't know which to pick (Skrrrt!)
Too much money, had to ask God, is it a trick?
Do it for my homies, and we split it like we prick the shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back to the money, doin' numbers, call me phone book
Hella bands of loud, we gettin' money, smokin' strong kush
Racks on top of racks, times 2, I'm gettin too paid
All about my business, really don't have time to play
Gettin' money's foreplay, all I do is blow cake
Like everything's my birthday, racks comin' fast way
Seen in a sports car, feelin' like a drag race (skrrt!)
Thumbing through a check, baby you can go and act chase

Fuck my daddy wife cause he ain't never did shit for me
My cousin ran off, I fucked his baby mama instantly
Fuck the judge daughter, nigga judged me for a ounce of lean
Run the train on the DJ girl cause he don't put my music in
Looking for yo bitch, she in the jugg house, getting it in
Nigga girl workin magic, always with casino and them
Threesome, magnum, smash her in the manion
My low ain't go but I fucked everybody in platinum
Baby I trust no bitch cause you know all these hoes I'm askin'
Metro made this beat so you know she had to smash him

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gonna take yo bitch, just take my bitch
Ain't no taking no truce you can take this dick
I ain't paying no rent, that ain't making no sense
I ain't buying no Beamer, ain't buying no Benz
I ain't tryna meet yo mama, I don't wanna hang around yo friends
Oh he bought some Dolce & Gabbana
But you fucking all of his partners
Ain't no Rovers, no Hondas, no Mazdas, no lobsters
Just another bitch on my roster
Your wife be fucking my partner
Oh that's your girlfriend but watch around with Waka (Flocka)
Save the bell with Scooter, now the bitch with Luda
I seen the bitch with Usher, my homeboy just bust her
If these rap niggas do their girlfriends like I do, they wouldn't touch us
She's a sucka for love, she's a fine motherfucker
I just seen her with Busta, I hope you don't love her

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Big Bank Black]
I got another nigga bitch with me, nothing but a nut to me

Got a pint of tuck on me, couple bands of dust on me
Hate a bitch to touch on me but love a ho to suck on me
Stripper bitch is rushin me, think she got a crush on me
Bitch I'm kickin pimpin, I should walk with a flip cup on me
I tell her lies, I tell her lies, tell me what you see in me
Why do you believe in me? Bitch, tell me what you see in me
I bet your bitch gon leave with me, say you're only fucking me
Bitch why are you deceiving me? Girl why are you deceiving me?

Fuck a nigga, that goes to anybody

[Verse 1]
Grab a bitch by the neck
Say bitch can ya suck a dick
Niggas talk behind my back
I can get you for a cheque
If I don't fuck with you niggas, that ain't never gonna change
I'm a trill OG, don't associate with no lames
I got drugs all in my system, put slugs all in yo frame
Respect this or get a death wish, or don't give a fuck about fame
Cuz I started watching niggas get paper
I came up and I turned the tables
See my money is like now and laters
I'm getting paid right now and later
I blow more grass than a gardener
Save the bullshit for a farmer
I woke up and bought a Fisker, call that good karma

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Swimming in dough, drowning in ounce
I take yo ho, drive around in my Benz
Its a 4 door, so she brung her friends
3am now I'm swimming it in
You a bitch and you know it, that's why you hate on my grind
And you know I'm winning and you can't deny
Say you not eating my nigga, you on a no money diet
You wan't a problem take mine, I'll gun you down if you try
Bulletproof vests, we dressing for war cuz we know whats next
Better be strapped, if ya don't react, put a bulls eye down on yo hat
You can die in yo tracks, see if yo homeboy got yo back
Niggas these choppas full and these bullets hungry and you look just like a snack

[Hook]
When I first started back in 1995
I wasn't moving keys, I was buying 1.5's
I started coming up, junkies recognized my face
Paid a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case
They used to run up on me be like, "Gucci, what you know?"
I tell them, "Get this glass, and get the fuck away from me ho!"
And everywhere I go, it became an instant cut
Cause they knew had them 20's and them big fat monkey nuts

[Verse 1]
Can't be scared of the dark when you come from Mountain Park
Shooting dice and playing cards, selling blow all at the park
Had a crush on your sister, but I used to serve your mama
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for the summer
And my job for the winter cooking bricks all in the kitchen
Junkies dead at the car wash cause I heard that they was snitching
Dope jumping out the gym, man it helped me buy my Timbs
Dope fiend Willie used to finger fuck my rims
Smokers didn't know my name so they used to call me Black
If you beep me for a 20, bet ya I'mma call you back
She on the dope man dick cause I'm a nigga with a sack
I'm the hustler of the year, and I know that for a fact

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Price so low that they call me thrift store
Standing at the store and I'm selling yayo
Bought a brick yesterday, got a 4-way to go
On the 5-way, everything gotta go
50 on the table, 100 on the floor
Middle of the summer, bruh I'mma make it snow
Like a Chia Pet, my money gon' grow
Still serving niggas through my burglar bars door
Jordace Jeans and a little afro
8-Ball jacket and a pair of Stan Smiths
I don't deal credit, that's how niggas get killed
And if you gotta tip, then your car getting peeled
17 going to the 5-5-9
Like a blind man, I don't see no lying
13 when a nigga did his first crime
18 when a nigga bought his first 9
If I'm lying, I'm flying, and I show ain't flying
Cooking up dope cause the J's keep buying
Robbers do lurk and I know they trying
Try Gucci Mane and you gon' be dying
Let me take you back in time
Let Gucci Mane refresh your mind
I'm a dope boy, stay on my grind
A good plug is so hard to find

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I put the kush in the stogie, yeah, I put the Bentley in Drive
I'm pulling out the garage, and thanking God I'm alive
I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back
I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't going back
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me
I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh
My whip game insane uh Ferrari Testarossa's
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
Like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks
And he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Let me take a break, let me catch my breath
Rolling with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything
Nigga, I don't need nothing else
It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in
I fucked homegirl and her best friend
You don't wanna miss out on your blessing
Got the dope dick and I use it as a weapon
I just

[Hook]
Shooter, BANG (x5)

[Verse 2: Euro]
Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson
Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doing it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in
Because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him
All I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
Gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinning cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's
Money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy making millions and she just started laughing
So you know I had to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
When I'm mad is when I don’t even wana mask on
War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on
Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me
So for certainly I'mma get my blast on
To the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
Think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazing, I mack on, play brave and get back home
With them AK's, crack arms with a straight face, that calm
And I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it
The Yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
I got a nigga showing and popping, picking and going
Packing a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and boom
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Looking the nose off, looking like I'm flicking the stove off
When I'm kicking the stove off, kicking the doors off
Everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say making a remarkable pay
Meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may
Fucking killing unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hopping the gate
If you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe
Sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang

Snatched a nigga chain, he ain’t with the Taylors
This nigga jewerly fake, he ain’t getting paper
He's a fuck nigga, not a real player
I took his bitch and made her learn how to roll papers
Off Youtube, you should do it too
Type of bitch that like to be around the who’s who
Yeah she get around, she like a hula-hoop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Big bag of that, coming back for that
Roll ‘em back to back, keep a sack of that
Don’t imagine that, that’s a matter of fact
Eyes down in the clouds where you find ‘em at
In my MCM bag where the magic at?
Come back to my room, jump on the broom
Swear the magic happened, she hit the magic dragon
Her ass started clapping, I was glancing
Smoking kill, that’s that extra pack
Tell the DJ to bring it back and tell the weedman to bring a sack
I got a bong and I got a biatch, ass fat, body full of tats
Pick her up, fuck her on the jet, nothing less

Before the money, before the game

Before the rollie, before the rollie
Them times was hard, I'm chasin' money
Before the rollie, before the rollie
The same circle, the same homies

[Ace Hood]
My same niggas, no new friends
Since day one, nigga no loose ends
Just a young nigga, outchea every day
I'mma get it by any means
That was just my mind frame
Before the Gucci and Louis
Before the Rollie dog I went through it
They ain't never fuck with me when I was broke
You ain't gonna stunt with me when I do it
Talk is cheap gotta put in that work
Remember them days I was ridin' in the merk
No A/C cause the shit don't work
Plus no radio to make shit worse
I'da come a long way and they know it
Fuck where you at its about where you goin'
Can't sit around and wait for no money
Ain't no naw nigga can't do it
Boy I did this shit for my niggas
Since day one I been a go getter
Now my money right and these hoes on me
Ho well go figure (Hoodnation)

[Hook]

[Ace Hood]
Ain't never had shit for' my dream
Ain't never sell no work to them fiends
Ain't never snitchin' and tell on my dogs
Wakin' up every day for that cream
Nigga I was down and out in that field
So stressed out because of them bills
Ain't no kinda hope in my city
Most my homies dead or in jail
Every night I toss and I turn
Feelin' like the Devil all on my back
Still I'm praying times get better
Had a few thoughts sell in that pack
Boy my mom gon' cuss me out,
Runnin' her blood pressure so high
When that money comin' in slow
It'll be a couple homies that rot
I'm that same nigga from out of Deerfield
Ain't shit changed except a rap deal
Gotta little money niggas actin' funny
Now I know how niggas in the trap feel
Ya'll rather me broke than be fucked up
And my same hood and those same chucks
I look back today throw prayers up
Now I never forget where I came from

[Hook]

[Meek Mill]
Before the rollie man it was cuffs
Hard times man shit was tough
I was told don't trust niggas
Be the main ones to come and hit you up
Still ridin' round like I ain't rich as fuck
Young niggas we clippin' up
Before the rollie hoes fronted on me
Now I pull up on em like bitch whats up?
Young niggas ballin'
Fuck niggas hatin'
Before I had a rollie
I ain't have no patience
A nigga ran up on me
Be a sad situation
We cap'n gown you pussy niggas ain't talkin' graduation
See there was something 'bout that Rollie when it touched my wrist
Something 'bout that Rollie when I fucked your bitch
Cause it caught her eye and she sucked my dick
She told you lies and you trust that bitch
Like hol' up
Ya'll niggas hatin' on me
When all these bad bitches waitin' on me
And all that shit you pray on me
I still kill niggas like shame on me

Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb

Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh

She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit

Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

When you shoot an AK you need 2 hands
Now the clip hanging like a fruit snack
Pull up with the shooters with the rookas and bazookas
Fuck around and make your whole crew dance
Let the whole clip go like oh dog
223 leave hole like snowball
Clip so long if you shoot the whole thang
You might fuck around and just doze off
Shoot a nigga nose off way up the street
Pull off make the tire screech
Young nigga running with the toolie
Hit you with then give it back to Juicy
Nickname my clip Chiquita
Gorillas running round with bananas
They gone empty out the whole clip bit 4th no kick
That what we call MC Hammer

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Clip so long I can lean on it
Got money then I put my whole team on it
Ice in my cup, pour lean on it
Chopper don't miss, got a beam on it
The trap jumping like it got a spring on it
Money so long I can swing on it
Double shoot you might OD on it
You know its a hit if it got me on it
I ball harder than a shooting guard
Fuck a hitman, I got a shooting guard
These rap niggas don't want beef with me
I fuck around and start shooting stars
Strapped at the hip like a fanny pack
Just in case a nigga wanna play
44 caliber bullets 100 that
Niggas get their mind right when it spray
All this cash I'm running out of room
Pussy ass nigga should of died in a womb
Bitch I've been doing what bosses do
Instead of buy new guns, I buy new goons
Seem like the real niggas die too soon
I'm high off lean, good weed, and shroom
My life is a movie, you keep acting up
I might give you a clip, nigga stay tuned

Got the club going up on a Tuesday
Got yo girl in the cut and she choosy

[Verse]
Working Monday night, on the corner flipping hard
Made at least three thousand, on the Boulevard
I've been working graveyard, shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
I've been flipping in the house, making juugs on the highway
I've been riding out of state, making money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon have another drink
I'm doing my stance, you know my Molly pink
I've got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn about what she think

[Hook] x4

I don't think that I should stay, you know I gotta go
You moving too fast, don't want to take it slow

You rock fake Wayne and Gucci Mane, you counterfeit
Your main nigga wanna get next to me

Pay off these lawyers to throw away cases
Don't think the traces can lead out of state
Finally made it, these niggas, they hate it

I could make Franklins do a back-a-flips!
How'd I get in this predicament?
Maybe you're guilty or innocent
This is New York, it ain't working out
Wishing we all can go back in time
You holding a grudge, I'm holding them slugs
I'm full of them drugs, it's all in my mug
Everybody tryna settle up
Hoping we can take a better route
Told the DA, I just call a bluff
Told the DA 'bout this jewelry on

You bitch ass niggas ain't nothing but a clone

Just another nigga with a gun, you’s a toy car
Gucci man, I murder tricks for fun, make your heart stop
And my real name is Gucci Mane, but Guwop is my alias
1017 Brick Squad Records, and we are the most hated clique
Scrape 8 bodies, killed it and dumped it on 26
Your little girl, but she 26 and damn little mama ate a bit
They say I’m violent but I’m the shit, I call it irony

This OG weed I got it lit, I call it ivy
PeeWee Longway you the shit, the OG weed supplier
Boys in the hood sell anything for profit

Foam, two cups got me gone, two red bitches I fuck on
When I’m geeked up in my zone, LONGWAY LONGWAY

1017, we America’s most wanted
And we gon serve these drugs to whoever damn want it

Making plays off the white, lean, and the marijuana (juug)
If you run up on the squad, boy you know that you’s a goner
Got questions bout the squad, just go ask your baby mama
This squad gon have it locked for the next ten summers
Sipping mud, rolling up OG that come from Humboldt

[Verse 3 – Gucci Mane]
Smoking Cali weed, stupid OG on my last B
Trap House on a dead end, fuck a cash freak
I got this pretty little tender on me, she just 23
She going deep, she catch a bomb a week, that’s 400 G’s
Pimping, call me macaroni cheese cause I hang with these
Baby say that Gucci Mane mean, ash tray out of weed
Gang sticky as a swisher sweet that I drink with lean
Boston caught me down a half a mil and it’s plain jane
Leaning, dreaming, took a nap woke up in Phoenix
Geeking, tripping, someone please take me to Neiman’s
Schemin', skeeting, leaving semen, need to clean it
Tricking, treating, don’t know you sleeping with the demon

[Verse 4 – Jose Guapo]
Got a big cup of mud, making plays off all these drugs
Got Longway with me and he say he ready to rob the plug
I can get your ass shot by sending a text message to Thug
Show up to your show, you know we gon shoot up the club
Cross the border, the place I order, diamonds on water
Your baby mama miley slaughter, don’t have to force her
Sending packs across the water, come place your order
Diamond bricks we buy from Florida, take back to Georgia
Brick Squad we the hit, score plug and hit for
Mamba weed, hit a lick for it, wrong clique boy
Break it down and serve whoever want it, got the streets hooked, don’t it
El Capitan, Big Guwop my homie, that’s 100

[Hook]Two nines with the safe off
Molly got me talking fast like im Take Off
Couple leaching hoes i gotta shake off
I fucked up when i fucked her at the lake house
Niggas just wanna be Gucci
Niggas just wanna wear louie
Niggas just wanna be actors
Living their life like a movie
Cut
Its a wrap then its over dog
I know i ain't like yall i need my money lord
K to the E to the Y
Thats me thats me
I motivate stop trying to hate thats Key thats Key
K to the E to the Y
Not you not you
The limit is the sky
Thats not true not true
(chorus)
How you watch and don't believe me x3
A commodity in front of y'all
I done heard, seen, and done it all
How you watch and don't believe me x3
Clear as day, in front of yall
Looking for the truth, its right in front of yall

(Verse 2)
Niggas just wanna be famous
Niggas just rapping to say it
Trapping a act till they rapping
Rapping on addictive actions
Women that wanna be famous
I ain't mad that she fucking
Lovin me cause I'm buzzing
Can't fuck with a nigga with nothing
It ain't here yeah but its coming
Don't want to but I'm thugging
Hit a lick cause I'm struggling
That show money ain't nothing
Hoes just wanna me gucci, in a , rocking louie
Ho should've got her masters
Bitch living life so backwards

(Chorus)[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Intro]
You don’t want to get me started ho
You don’t want to get me started ho
Ace Hood
We the best, YMCMB

[Hook: Ace Hood]
My nigga fuck what you say, my niggas all for the cake
Was on the block every night, was on the block every day
I do this shit for my fam, you do this shit for the fame
I kept it real from the joint and that’s just how I remain
Don’t get me started, don’t get me started
My nigga, my nigga don’t get me started, don’t get me started
My niggas go real as they go so hard, so dumb retarded
Cause a nigga wanna think it’s sweet then try me
Don’t get me started, don’t get me started

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Ok now clique full of niggas with tempers
Clique full of niggas and killas
When they cut me I don’t pay them
With the two them nigga eyes remember
I’m the same lil nigga from the block ho
And I drive still walk with the Glock on
I’m about that cream, guaplage on
Don’t get me started up ho
I come to whip in the Phantom
Y’all niggas really can’t stand it
Them hoes really be jocking
Diamonds that got them watching
Say Ace ain’t getting’ no money
Pussy, I beg your pardon
You don’t wanna get me started
You don’t wanna see how I’m ballin’
Ok ok, what it look like?
Well that good thing got and it’s good night
With a bad bitch, she’s so thick
She rolling, I know this
And her neck gon' froze, better know that
Act up, I snap like a Kodak
And these niggas these niggas
These niggas these niggas
These niggas these niggas won’t hold back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Ok them pussy niggas be hating
Focus on what I’m making
Came through in tha Phantom
Them pussy niggas can’t take it
Spit big bread on my chain
Still on stroke with your main
I’m rich nigga like yea nigga
They hoping I stay the same
They say I changed when I got fame
Bitch niggas, they complain
Flat black in that 2 door
Nigga must think he Bruce Wayne
I’m like damn hood what it be like?
All dem diamonds dont need lights
New bitch like every day
Swear to God you won’t see her twice
That purple that got me leaning
They don’t wanna get me started
Come on this hook, no phonics
Introduce this shit and go retarded
Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing
Extended clips that’s standing tall; two chain

[Hook]
