[Outro]
[Honey Cocaine]

Errybody in the streets they know[Intro: Doe B]
I ain't missin' (don't miss, nigga)
One shot, one chance
The kid, let's do it

[Hook: Doe B]
I fuck who I wanna fuck
When I'm out I'mma hit her and I ain't missin'
And you can duck all you wanna duck
Hundred shots out the ripper and I ain't missin'
These niggas tell me they feel me
I drop a hit when I'm ready and I ain't missin'
You know they can't do nothing with me
I ain't ballin', I'm swishin'
I ain't missin'

[Verse 1: Doe B]
Just copped a six for the summer, you know my pull up game vicious
Can hit your bitch if I wanna, real talk, I ain't missin'
[?] with no ceilings
In a room full of prostitutes, boy, you still can't fuck with 'em
Ballin' like I'm Nowitzki
Better yet, like Mark Cuban
I ain't talkin' my necklace when I say my links are Cuban
Bricks comin' in Tuesday
Ah, man, they can't stop me
Got your bitch on that Molly
And got four hoes in the trunk
Nigga, this ain't no Audi
Park the foreign in the projects, they holler "Whoa, Kemosabe"
This a million dollar nigga, bitch I'm Ted DiBiase
Wait for a nigga to trap me, I'm Barry Bonds with the gun
Hit homeruns or better, nigga this the steroids era

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Now pay attention, don't wanna miss this
I came up with the quickness
Haters hate that I made it, they actin' sour as citrus
Walk in rooms and cause reactions
They're like "Who the fuck is this?"
I came with homies but I leave here with bitches
Listen, now if I set my eyes on her and then decide that I want her
Then I ain't missin', believe me, when I make moves she's a gonner
Whether Rihanna, Madonna, Lana Del Ray, or your momma
She's old as nada, I close my eyes then hit a pinata
I'm as crazy as Patrick, a young american psycho
If I said it, I meant it, now listen there is no typo
Haters keep tryna tell me to shut my arrogant pie hole
But I'm a bull in the booth, who wanna pair against Michael
I kept giving less and less fucks 'till I got to zero
Now all I care about is pussy, deniero
Tryna take care of my family, I feel like I'm a young Rob De Niro
I'm the villian, I am no fucking hero, it's all for real though

[Hook: Doe B]

[Verse 3: Maino]
Now, everything in my vision I plan to hit with precision
Niggas food on my dishes, I'm 'bout to handle my business
Lil' homies is trippin', you pray to God that we missin'
I swear to God we ain't missin'
Now up the guard we gonna lift him
Man these pussies is bitches, and my niggas is itching
I just lost my religion so help me Lord, I'm a villain
Got the soul of a soldier, got the vibe of a rider
Got the eyes of a killer, I don't miss when I fire
If that was still in my spirit, I don't talk man I live it
When I speak niggas listen, bullets close like they kissin'
I'm just battle my dough, I'm down bottom with dough
Got them funerals ready, niggas die in the road!

[Hook: Doe B][Hook: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money ain't goin' to shame?
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

[Hook: T-Pain][Intro]
To the pimpin' and that's where I'm gonna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay, and I say

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me get straight to the money
Go straight to the money and that's where I'm gonna be
But it's just like

[Verse 1]
Don't fuck with a nigga like you
Cuz a nigga like you
Keep on fake shoes, you look like fool for a nigga like who?
Nigga like me
Nigga like me?
Niggas don't act like niggas like me
Niggas don't move like niggas like me
Bitches be like "that nigga ain't street"
That nigga ain't real, that nigga ain't right
That nigga don't bang, he ain't part of that life
That nigga ain't rich, that nigga been lyin'
That nigga ain't fly, that nigga ain't live

See, the difference is I'm a different nigga
You same lame around different killas
You came with her, I left with her
I'm up in her, you textin' her
You paid for it, I pass on it
Speed up, I gas on it
Drunk drive, I crash on it
Fly out, I passport it
All these hoes
Fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me, just really might be
The last real nigga they see
See!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Nigga like me, true OG
Nigga like you, certified lame
You can rich, bricks are a payday bitch
And I swear ain't shit gonna change, nigga
I be in the hood where the gangstas be
You a pussy nigga, you supposed to bleed
Type of niggas say we beefin' but you pressin' charges
Type of nigga gotta plug but [?]
I can see you in the club talkin' loud arguments
I'm the type don't say a word, I just start sparkin'
Bang! Bang! Bang, bang!
Hit all the targets
I'm forever thuggin' and my niggas [?]
Real niggas, this the lifestyle
I should get her digits, get her iced out

[Hook][Tracey Horton: Intro] (Rakim)
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah (Uh...yeah...)
(This is for the haters...keep hatin)
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah
La-da-da-dah, la-da-da-dah
(It's what we call money music, right here)
(Uh, yeah, let's go in)

[Verse 1: Rakim]
I perform in cities, hoods, and slums, the best seller is drugs
And money is the only thing that get love
They say don't let it make you, but that's how they rate you
And the more you got, the more they hate you (That's okay too)
Just don't get in the way, cause at the end of the day
My agenda's make sure I get them ends to get paid (uh-huh)
So I'm stackin grands 'til the math expand
It's the man with the master plan
Since a Bambino, cash made my path cross with evil
Uno dos cinco on a crowded corner rollin cee-lo
To chips and the chick in the casino pouring Clicquot
Cause now I make music for the c-notes
From New York to Puerto Rico, California to Rio
Hit the streets like the kilo but I'm legal
It's swag like I walk with heat though with all my people
But it's just me and my altered ego

[Hook: Tracey Horton]
I walk these streets, wit my mind on my plan
It's alright if you don't understand
I walk these streets, think like I got a gun in my hand
Cause hatin is the nature of man
(Sometimes I wanna, stop the cameras, just pop the hammer
Box the innocent bystander and his man up)
I walk these streets, think like I got a gun in my hand
It's alright if you don't understand
Just stay outta my waaaay

[Verse 2: Maino]
Yo, one for my comrades, two for my family
Three for the day that I run into my enemies
We gon' make a movie, the world gon' remember me
I survived it all dawg, what the hell you tellin me?
I remember days when, I was young and aidin
Cuttin class, chasin ass, couldn't pass grades and
Chillin on the block then, listenin to Rakim
Back of his album cliqued up with Killer Ben
Supreme Magnetic and I wasn't athletic
But I ran around with the Tre-8 Magnetic
Money on my mind, crack vials in my Levi's
Been a thug since I had the C.R.E.A.M. colored Filas
Yeah, yeah, we fly, seen it all with these eyes
Gunplay and drugs if you put my mind on rewind
Fast forward my life, ya boy done made it
If I could do it over, I wouldn't change it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rakim]
(Ay, good lookin out my dude)
Aiyyo Maino, it's the same ol' same ol'
Don't matter if you in it for the fame or you lay low
Haters gon' hate but, it's okay though (Keep doin what you ddo)
The angle is make sure the payroll stay swoll
Big faces, cake dough and di-nay-ros
Rubles, yen yang, euros and pesos
Seven digit figures, tryna make more zay-ros
Spray holes in whoever in the way so (Stay outta my waaaay)
While I count the next bundle (that's right)
"All means necessary," Malcolm X hustle
A threat yet humble, about to flex muscle
Get a big amount then I'm in and out the next jungle
Cause every other day, I'm in another state
It's like I cross the thin line between love and hate
But I gotta eat, gotta get another plate
So I'm on my cake walk for the cake

[Hook]

Just stay outta my waaaay..
(It's what they do..)
Just stay outta my waaaay..They can't fuck with us nigga
Drewski!
Ridin on these niggas, they already know what it is and what we about
What we about nigga?!
Cipha Sounds what's up nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Drewski]
Regardless the rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales
Meet the devil when I see hell
And by a state[?]
Pullin your fate in the palm of my hands
Blow you away if you ain't part of the fam
The realest nigga in the game
Tattoos cover my pain
Eyes closed still holdin my aim
Sweatsuit, gold rolly and chain
Dope dealer shit
Black fist, on him[?] Hussein
That's killer shit
Street nigga, speak for the crooks
Give me feminine looks
Cocksucka I'm the king of the brook[?]
Dress like I'm in a video--Pop!--
Fuck the whole radio--Pop!--
Fuck these other niggas that they ride for the city though

[Verse 2]
Henny, white, no ice
Eat only five-star caviar
No jobs given
In the ride an Apple Macintosh

Second-guessing get your melon caved in
Then we celebratin
Hit your shorty while he level playin[?]
Do it for the streets nigga
Do it for the tweets
I'm a corner-store nigga
I just rap off[?] to beef
Raise the hurt, leave em double dead
I'm a bubble head
I never listen to nothin my mother said
Poppy like Camacho
Boxin, duckin vanachos[?]
Watch[?] me call me guapo
Pockets fatter than sauco[?]
The weed: color purple
Beat the pussy like Harpo
Deadly with the manos
I'll give you all a pistaco[?]

[Verse 3]
Fo-wheel drive with the piece on me
Coke boys got in lots with the streets homie
They frontin live with a weak omen
Whole chicken broke down, move that less than a week homie
Courtside seats bought my own whistle
Three-quarter mink, bad to the bone gristle
When your team up, niggas wanna ball with you
No hammer but I bet you got them hoes with you
Bald-head no lockout, go hard no cop out
Just watch your back then jump out
Boys gon hop out
High-school dropout, figured how to get it on the stove
Pull up to my old school with the drop out

[Verse 4 Troy Ave]
Dope boy swag to the max
Troy Ave mofucka and I'm dealin with facts
Not made[?] for TV, but I'm on TV
J-Ro[?] the deep[?], mofucka you see me
Self-made, self-paid, that's boss
Twitter DM's from the boy Rick Ross
No contract but I deal
Cocaine, still shit real, I am ill
Count on my Bendo's[?]

Adidas deal, I have never been checked
Show me my respect or get shown Wally[?] wet[?] motherfuckers

[Verse 5 Mack Wilds]
Yeah, it's Mack
There ain't a nigga that you know more thorough than this
It's a shame, cuz a singer killin' her more than ya bitch
Bust off and let the hot barrel sit on her lips, heh
And that's just me up on some ignorant shit
I got a couple motherfuckers gettin rich as a bitch
As I put my city back with the music and shit
Guess I'm the
Most imitated
Grammy-nominated
Hotel accommodated
Cheerleader prom dated
I put my city on my back, I'm never overrated
The young Samo, loading up all his ammo
Vandalize every time Cipha put me on fuckin wax
Catchin bodies, TV now on the fuckin track

[Verse 6]
Ayo, a few ways out of the hood
I think about it while I'm ravelin 'woods
The haze round, but I'd rather the kush
I get it soft, I was grabbin the cook
Fresh off the block to this rap
That's a real good look
And I just had a brand new kid
I need money for some diapers and a brand new crib
Being broke, this shit hurt like a brand new bid
That's why I cut the dope twice and I'm still in the biz, nigga, uh
Eything; real shit
Fuckin with the boy for
Real flint[?], keep my circle tight
Cuz they'll swell[?] quick
Niggas stylin

All the above, and everything between
These niggas say they real, what does that really mean?
And I don't trust these clowns, some are always starin
You know these muh'fuckers fake as them chains they wearin (HA-HAAAAAAH!)
Real niggas stay aboard, others jump ship
Real niggas earn they keep, others lunch/sick
You niggas actin like sugar, might as well strip
Niggas actin like strippers, might as well tip (HA-HAAAAAH!)
Hatin get you nowhere, have a safe trip
And bitch I'm goin to the moon, I need a spaceship
Homey's in the big house, so I sit in my big house
Let you run your big mouth, 'bout things you know shit 'bout
I did it for the streets, I did it for the hood
I'm gettin money before rap, let's get it understood

Ask Westside Blue, I been +Robin Hood+
I never been a bitch, I never been a snitch
I love some fileet, it always make me shit
See I ain't worried about you, it won't make me shit
See I'm only into things that'll make me rich
I lost my faith in this fake shit, stay to the faith shit
But I be damned I lose my face to this fake shit
Deep in the matrix, so much hate I can taste it
You suckas can't take it, my life finish my break {?}

To the 9-Factor, to mother fucking Trillion Billion Dollar Beats
This is what we do!

[Hook]
24/7-365 on my grind, cause I, I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine [x2]
How you gon' do it, nigga?
(One) Hustle hard nigga, (Two) Stack paper, (Three) Cut the line nigga, (Four) Watch haters
(One) Hustle hard nigga, (Two) Stack paper, 24/7-365 on my grind

[Verse 1: Huey]
Since I grind, these niggas have lost they mind
Hating because I shine from family to all-kind
That's 24/7, everyday of the year
Everyday I am here, I gon' make shit clear
Fuck you, fuck whoever got something to say
'Bout how I handle my business, I'm a do it my way
I am young, I am smart, never small with some heart
I can just taste my money when I hit the airport
You next to overseas, I can smell the palm trees
Guess I'm just a grasshopper, attracted to all green
Now listen to Al Green to bring out the old days
Wishing O.G.'s was still stuck into they old ways
No snitches, no bitching, getting digits by the hour
Ignore the phrase, "More money more power"
As a Mama's boy I hate to see Mama cry
So 24/7 - 365 on my grind, know why?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maino]
(Listen) Now I'm a get it, I get it until my numbers call
So I'm just a name and a memory on my homie's wall
I be movin' O's, I'm tryna just build my dough up
So I'm just a slab in a Corrimal with my toes up
Niggas deal with jealousy, baby how can they hate on me
I'm a keep it thorough I'm not, not a celebrity
I'm real like a Phoenix Sun, feel like my day is coming
If I can just kill competition, then all the fees will come
You can't stunt on I, the whole Summer's mine
(Hi Hater) Got the country waving hi and bye
Brooklyn to Saint Lou, Brooklyn we can't lose
It's hustle hard, I'm a get it til' I can't move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
It's the waterboy, we keep them bottles Jack
I tell them haters bye, twist it hard and throttle back
What they talking, dollas? We got a lot of that
Cash Money Million, now go and swallow that
Tricks make it rain, we don't carry ones
I'm from 7th Street, now nigga where you from?
It's a gang thang, can't it money counters
All we do is slang, and pray on out-of-towners
Ask around, homie, we some chain-checkers
And we are not the same, so lame run yo' necklace
It's a new West, the whole game respect us
And fuck these old rappers, since they won't accept us
Ask around, G., A clown we spit them breezy raps
And I would trade you nigga's life to bring Eazy back
Man, you niggas wack, you got to coach a dime
I'm 'bout to bring us back, look like the coast is mine

[Hook][Hook: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money ain't goin' to shame?
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie

Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind

If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

[Hook: T-Pain][Intro]
To the pimpin' and that's where I'm gonna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ay, and I say

[Hook]
All these hoes!
Wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me get straight to the money
Go straight to the money and that's where I'm gonna be
But it just like

Won't fuck with a nigga like you, cuz a nigga like you
So goddamn lame, it's a goddamn shame what you gotta go through
But I'm just like

Cuz I'm just like

[Bridge]
Fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me get straight to the money
Go straight to the money and that's where I'm gonna be
But it's just like
All these hoes!

[Verse 1]
Don't fuck with a nigga like you
Cuz a nigga like you
Keep on fake shoes, you look like fool for a nigga like who?
Nigga like me
Nigga like me?
Niggas don't act like niggas like me
Niggas don't move like niggas like me
Bitches be like "that nigga ain't street"
That nigga ain't real, that nigga ain't right
That nigga don't bang, he ain't part of that life
That nigga ain't rich, that nigga been lyin'
That nigga ain't fly, that nigga ain't live

See, the difference is I'm a different nigga
You same lame around different killas
You came with her, I left with her
I'm up in her, you textin' her
You paid for it, I pass on it
Speed up, I gas on it
Drunk drive, I crash on it
Fly out, I passport it
All these hoes
Fuck with a nigga like me
Cuz a nigga like me, just really might be
The last real nigga they see
See!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Nigga like me, true OG
Nigga like you, certified lame
You can rich, bricks are a payday bitch
And I swear ain't shit gonna change, nigga
I be in the hood where the gangstas be
You a pussy nigga, you supposed to bleed
Type of niggas say we beefin' but you pressin' charges
Type of nigga gotta plug but [?]
I can see you in the club talkin' loud arguments
I'm the type don't say a word, I just start sparkin'
Bang! Bang! Bang, bang!
Hit all the targets
I'm forever thuggin' and my niggas [?]
Real niggas, this the lifestyle
I should get her digits, get her iced out

[Hook][Verse 1: Maino]
Maino hustle hard, better pray to god
I swear to god, Lames better play they part
It's going down, I run this town
I’m here now, let’s get it!
Black flag, Black tee, shooters in a black truck
Diamonds on, getting money, haters on my right nut
Left arm automa bezzle look like falling stars
Fifty shot Calico, niggas better call on God
I'm the one they fear reason why they're running scared
Do it Mob style, bullet right behind his head
I declare I'm the king of Kings County
Stand up nigga why these haters can’t down me
Look around I round the town these other niggas clowns see
Go ahead let him talk slick I bet I make his mouth bleed
Homie we strong, these rap niggas peeons
They cuddle with the same bitches I pee on
Brick getters getting bread in rainy weather
My white girl savetta and it go panamera
I’m a don bitch miss me with that nonsense
.44 holster underneath my armpit
Fuck nigga the reason to love niggas
My last homie snaked me that's why I don't trust niggas
Straight to the devil is where I took them
Fuck what you heard I run Brooklyn

[Hook]
Cooler then antifreeze dammit these rappers be
The baddest thing happening since King had a dream
Cooler then antifreeze dammit these rappers be
The baddest thing happening since King had a dream

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Can;t stop too much cream veiw me on your movie screen
Got the sweater, got the hat, sneaker, and the Gucci jeans
Sicker than I used to be, time to get them used to Queens
Flawless bitches usually turn them all into super fiens
Mamy i’m the coolest from PYT's to cougars
The haters remorse they can D-I-E from rugers
Nigga say hello to Judahs, genius how I do this
Cleanest pictures standing out of Beemers with the blue wrist
Shorty keep my name low till my name, tell honey my angle
I'm touring and she taking off her leggings on the table
Pussy popping on the Skyp, crustin' on the phone
I’ma fuck her with my freestyle going off the dome
I got her smoking weed now, she’s glowing off patron
Kush cologne, weirdo when I push my poem, cripple chrome
In my Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island, Bronx, and Brooklyn zone
And I'm Nina packing, paper staking, bitch go get your own!They can't fuck with us nigga
Drewski!
Ridin on these niggas, they already know what it is and what we about
What we about nigga?!
Cipha Sounds what's up nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Drewski]
Regardless the rain or snow, sleet or hail
I kick street tales
Meet the devil when I see hell
And by a state[?]
Pullin your fate in the palm of my hands
Blow you away if you ain't part of the fam
The realest nigga in the game
Tattoos cover my pain
Eyes closed still holdin my aim
Sweatsuit, gold rolly and chain
Dope dealer shit
Black fist, on him[?] Hussein
That's killer shit
Street nigga, speak for the crooks
Give me feminine looks
Cocksucka I'm the king of the brook[?]
Dress like I'm in a video--Pop!--
Fuck the whole radio--Pop!--
Fuck these other niggas that they ride for the city though

[Verse 2]
Henny, white, no ice
Eat only five-star caviar
No jobs given
In the ride an Apple Macintosh
Tay[?] connection
Second-guessing get your melon caved in
Then we celebratin
Hit your shorty while he level playin[?]
Do it for the streets nigga
Do it for the tweets
I'm a corner-store nigga
I just rap off[?] to beef
Raise the hurt, leave em double dead
I'm a bubble head
I never listen to nothin my mother said
Poppy like Camacho
Boxin, duckin vanachos[?]
Watch[?] me call me guapo
Pockets fatter than sauco[?]
The weed: color purple
Beat the pussy like Harpo
Deadly with the manos
I'll give you all a pistaco[?]

[Verse 3]
Fo-wheel drive with the piece on me
Coke boys got in lots with the streets homie
They frontin live with a weak omen
Whole chicken broke down, move that less than a week homie
Courtside seats bought my own whistle
Three-quarter mink, bad to the bone gristle
When your team up, niggas wanna ball with you
No hammer but I bet you got them hoes with you
Bald-head no lockout, go hard no cop out
Just watch your back then jump out
Boys gon hop out
High-school dropout, figured how to get it on the stove
Pull up to my old school with the drop out

[Verse 4 Troy Ave]
Dope boy swag to the max
Troy Ave mofucka and I'm dealin with facts
Not made[?] for TV, but I'm on TV
J-Ro[?] the deep[?], mofucka you see me
Self-made, self-paid, that's boss
Twitter DM's from the boy Rick Ross
No contract but I deal
Cocaine, still shit real, I am ill
Count on my Bendo's[?]
Got it off lend though
New York City
To[?] the big homies my hand do[?]
Adidas deal, I have never been checked
Show me my respect or get shown Wally[?] wet[?] motherfuckers

[Verse 5 Mack Wilds]
Yeah, it's Mack
There ain't a nigga that you know more thorough than this
It's a shame, cuz a singer killin' her more than ya bitch
Bust off and let the hot barrel sit on her lips, heh
And that's just me up on some ignorant shit
I got a couple motherfuckers gettin rich as a bitch
As I put my city back with the music and shit
Guess I'm the
Most imitated
Grammy-nominated
Hotel accommodated
Cheerleader prom dated
I put my city on my back, I'm never overrated
The young Samo, loading up all his ammo
Vandalize every time Cipha put me on fuckin wax
Catchin bodies, TV now on the fuckin track

[Verse 6]
Ayo, a few ways out of the hood
I think about it while I'm ravelin 'woods
The haze round, but I'd rather the kush
I get it soft, I was grabbin the cook
Fresh off the block to this rap
That's a real good look
And I just had a brand new kid
I need money for some diapers and a brand new crib
Being broke, this shit hurt like a brand new bid
That's why I cut the dope twice and I'm still in the biz, nigga, uh
Eything; real shit
Fuckin with the boy for
Real flint[?], keep my circle tight
Cuz they'll swell[?] quick
Niggas stylin
Guns on us be wilin
Resorts in the island
The belts is Italian[Intro: ItsTheReal]
Yeah
You bitch
You motherfucker
You dumb bitch
You stupid motherfucker
You feel me?
Nah
Nah, you don't feel me
You know why?
Cause you dead, motherfucker
Do you hear me?
Nah
Nah, you don't hear me
You know why?
Cause you dead, motherfucker
That's right, that's what you get for fucking with us
Fuck you, you dead motherfucker
That's what you get for fucking with us and Maino
Now we're gonna talk our shit
Yeah
Not now, but...closer to now
Like now!

[Hook: Eric and Jeff]
You don't want beef wit us
Or our friend Maino!
We bring the streets wit us
Our friend Maino!
We carry heat wit us
Our friend Maino!
You can't compete wit us
Or our friend Maino!

[Verse 1: ItsTheReal]
[E]Got something to say, say it to Maino's face
Dudes wanna trip, Maino will put you in a suitcase
[J] Maino does the dirty work, Spic and Span, Mr. Clean
Knuckle sandwich all day with a hit of Listerine
[E] You don't want to try us, our parents spoiled us rotten
We cry over spilled milk; rest in peace, never forgotten
[J] If we got a problem, yo, he'll solve it
Check out your neck while Maino revolves it
[E] Question Jeff, you're 'bout to learn the hard way
People get nosy, Maino hit 'em with the nasal spray
[J] Welcome to the house of pain, take your shoes off at the door
Maino's got fists of fury, and we've got a couple more
[E] We'll have you eating through a straw cause you's a sucker
Me, Jeff, and Maino, we're one bad motherfucker, for real
[J] Ski mask and boots on, coming back from Aspen
You Mr. Potato Head, Maino get to mashing

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
You don't want beef wit us
Or our friend Maino!
We bring the streets wit us
Our friend Maino!
We carry heat wit us
Our friend Maino!
You can't compete wit us
Go get 'em, Maino!

[Verse 2: Maino]
I don't know the Maino that they talking 'bout
Cause I don't like problems -- I'd rather talk it out
Rather speak to you, so we can squash the beef
I'm not a violent man, and I don't pack heat
I'm a nice guy, I wear glasses now
I'm a different dude, I wouldn't blast you now
And I don't want drama, guess I'm a changed man
Church on every Sunday -- giving praise, man
See, I'm not a thug; let's get it understood
Live in a big house -- I don't rep the hood
And as a matter of fact, they don't want me back
My friends are businessmen, they not selling crack
Wouldn't bust a grape, wouldn't hurt a fly
The shit they rapping 'bout, I'm not that guy
So if you hear this track, please pay no attention
Cause they gon' get me killed for all the things they mention

[Hook]

[Outro: ItsTheReal]
You know, I was doing some thinking. Maybe we should be the bigger people and we should apologize
Yeah. If nothing else, we have manners
When I said, "You put the 'bitch' in 'obituary,' I totally didn't mean that. It was taken out of context
When I said that we were gonna put you in the ground and hope that a tree grows out of it, it was done with the best of intentions
Look, when I said, 'Fuck your life,' I was talking about the cereal. Everyone knows I'm a Cheerios guy[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
(Yeah!) We all bleed the same blood
(Yeah!) And we beat on the same drum
(Yeah!) It's not about where ya at
(Yeah!) It's about where you come from
And I'mma keep on thuggin 'til the day I DIE!
(Yeah!) Oh yeah (Yeah!)
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)

[Verse 1: Maino]
Unstoppable, yo, Maino!
Ran up in Atlantic, told 'em let me go
Smack my A&R and grabbed him by his throat
Playin with my life'll get you yellow-taped
Runnin in and out of church like I'm the yellow Ma$e
All-black fleet like when Obama get in
Missiles aimed at yo' building like Osama livin
"Fuck 'em all" is what I'm screamin from that Mase' seat
(How About Some Hardcore) like it's '93
Think deep, feel the pain in my homie's face
And only then you'll understand why my homies bang
Strapped up, this is us, fuck a deal nigga
Gun boys be like "Maino is a real nigga"
Yeah, me and Bust bleed the same blood
Handcuffed to the bus, we the same thugs
Never fear, just know that I'mma ride for ya
All black baby welcome to my mafia

[Hook]

I gotta tell somebody yeahhhhh

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
I'm passionate about gettin this money
Handlin those that be plottin on takin it from me
Some of these niggas forgot I be makin it funny
We're spendin like my fingers rotten then papercut bloody
In case you ain't knowin we back dominatin the country
Until I make these niggas black with the strength of a monkey
Balenciaga boss, bitch address me as Mister
Eat salmons and tortellini down at the Bella Vista
We move in silence bitch you better whisper
And sizzle the street with the heat until it hella blister
So much bottles, got 'em for every drinker
So much head I be callin mami a heavy thinker
Victorious like a nigga conquered another nation
Buyin bottles and drinkin to drown the sufferation
Could give a fuck about your plan, watch how I handle that
If it ain't YMCMB or Conglomerate, cancel that!

[Hook]

I gotta tell somebody, yeahhhhhhhh

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
So inspirin when a nigga doubt
Look around and see how niggas try to count me out
Only if niggas stepped in my shoes and took a walk
And thought of shit I sacrificed I wouldn't have to talk
And I'm like a bitch's blouse on a clothesline
And treatin how I stumbled on another goldmine
While embracin what God be havin for me
You can never stop what is destined, I hope you're happy for me[Intro]

But if you got a man he don't do it like that
Baby I ain't no actor, black bandana

We gone
On the wall
Maino
Drama
Classy

[Hook]
This life I live
Just to feed my kids
And you can touch me
I don't came for nothing
I still survive
I went so high
I felt like I never
Been so close
Ever, nver
I've never been been so close
Ever, never

[Verse 1: Maino]
Look into my eyes, you could see the truth
You could see the grind, you could see the booth
You could see the shine, you could see the coupe
You could me, but you don't see the roof
Cause I ride hard, I could see the stars
No top now, I'm close to the God
Hold my son and hope for tomorrow
This for the ones that won't see tomorrow
Count my blessings, yes n' could a been stressing
Made it out the ghetto, Lord no questions
Stylin', growling, throwing in up thousands
Made it out of the project housing
Now look at me, I really can't believe
It all came true, I'l living out a dream
Clone my self, I'm never going to fail
It's gotta be Heaven, I've already been to Hell

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maino]
I could a been lost, could a been a loser
Could a been dead, shot by the ruger
Could a been dumb, drug abuser
Could a been stressed, groom be a tomb a
But I found life, God damn right
Could a been left in a cell no light
Look at my life, somethings with me
Gotta be blessed, cause Angels with me
Let's get it popping, rocking, still club hopping
Straight to the top, failure not an option
Hate me, love me, still can't budge me
None of y'all ever gon' judge me
Never been close, still it like this
Never seen a sky from a view like this
Gotta feel good when you living like this
Lord this is Heaven, who wouldn't want this

[Hook][Hook x2]

I’m about cream, I’ma, I’ma ’bout cream (about that)
I’m about cream, I’ma, I’ma ’bout cream
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I’m about cream, I’ma, I’ma ’bout cream

[Maino]
I’m about cream, homie I’m about cash
I’m about Dollar signs, where that brown bag?
I’m a big boi, 3 stacks, Outkast
For that bread I be in your house like
I go deaf ears if it ain't about no dough
Porsche mind state this my Panamera flow
Offshore Royal oak, I got diamonds in ‘em
Gucci jean suit, keep a couple thousand in ‘em
Came up hard, handle food in the refrigerator
Now these haters can’t breath need a respirator
Women beep me every time they see me
Sippin’ DP on my way to DC
Ask niggas out in Florida they know me well
Pretty bitches say I’m crazy out in ACL
Fuck the bullshit baby I’m about mine
Champagne in the air, it’s about time

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]

Just left my PO and everything kosher
Bitch I’m getting money like the end getting closer
Money on my mind, pussy on my radar
Bitch I’m getting paid, I’m on my Bernie Madoff
Money talks, bullshit walks, cut the legs off
Aim at your egg, turn that shit to eggnog
And if I fall, my money is my cushion
Niggas can’t see me like they not looking
To the red flag, a pledge of allegiance
Y’all bitches don’t want beef like vegans
I don’t have a care and if I do I take care of it
Haters dead waiting I ain’t with that pall bearer shit
Never played lotto, I don’t believe in luck
They tried to send me sugar, wasn’t sweet enough
Maino whats poppin? Hustle hard nigga
This that money train, all aboard nigga

[Hook]

[Maino]
I’m about cream, homie I’m about bread
I’m about bad bitches that’s about head
I’m about to ride by hanging out the Benz
We getting money like we never heard of the feds
The black Bentley Coupe rollin’ like the Batmobile
I feel 8 feet tall man I’m Shaq O’neil
I’m about guap baby, I’m about cake
Push the button in the doors to about face
Whats poppin mami, I be gettin’ money now
I’m from Brooklyn but they love me out in Houston now
Say “hi” to life, bye to my broke days
I’m about a dollar, everyday all day

[Hook][Intro: Maino]
All I ever been was a criminal
Maino left the street's it's a miracle

[Hook: Maino]
All I ever been was a criminal
Niggas said Maino left the street's it's a miracle
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs alone
If you know the words, won't you sing along
Ehey, ehey, now
Ehey, ehey, now
Ehey, ehey, now
Ehey, ehey, now

[Verse 1: Maino]
Rolling through the city in my big wheel
Raindrops dancing on my windshield
I can see the future in on plane view
While my past is peeking though my rear view
It's a miracle, how I made it out the slums
They said I'll be dead before I'm 21
Look ma, here's a gift from your oldest son
Never had a house so I'm bout to buy you one
Cause I remember days we needed help
Now it's champagne on the shelf
Trying to balance fame and the wealth, made a name for myself
But tell me what's important, the game or my health
So this is for the ones that remember me before rap
Where my only source of money came from home crack
Young boy, big heart, quit the click clack
Misled, little head and a big hat

[Hook: Maino]

[Verse 2: Maino]
Niggas saying I ain't really lyrical
It's cool if you don't get it, it ain't meant for you
You never faced the judge when he sentences you
You couldn't walk a mile in my Louis shoes
I used to play the block trying to dodge the D's
Ask Bird, ask Cream, they remember me
They remember me and Dog and that blue Ford
No class pants holding up that 44
Young and wild, headed for that B now
Before I knew it, I was in that pen wild
No music, way before the videos
Nikiya came to see me on the visit yo
Can't forget Fatty and Serena
Used to write me letters, it helped me keep my head up
I was trapped in, but you had my back then
Green prison clothes, I ain't even rap then

[Hook: Maino]

[Verse 3: Maino]
Yeah, things different for me, people listen to me
Little girls they see me, and snap pictures of me
You never know, never say never
Used to think that I will be in the street forever
Me and mouse yup, me and Seino
Early 90's baby what up to Gino
Laying back, pretty women bring me breakfast
Thinking back I kept the Tech and the Lexus
No record deal, just a big dream
Hoping the coke will bring me everything
Cause all I ever been was a criminal
You either end up in jail or in a funeral
Shout out to the homies I grew up with
Used to shoot, used to rob, sell drugs with
Bad choices, good friends turn to memories
Still the same, still Maino, I remember me

[Hook: Maino][Hook: Gunplay]
A million crispy hunneds. A million hunned dollar bills. [x4]
I know what I got to do. [x7]

[Verse 1: Maino]
A million crispy hunneds throwin' up them dollar bills
Strippers damn near runnin' fighting over dollar bills
Niggas know I'm on it them bitches know that I'm for real. All I ever wanted was to finally get to touch a mil
Now I know what I got to do. In the coupe that's powder blue. With a bitch that play with credit but she play with powder too
Bout that money and that murder for that money you get murdered. And my name been holding weight so forget everything you heard of
I'm excited bout them riches in the club with a thousand bitches. Diamonds light up like they sparkle see me smiling while they glisten
I'm a G before a rapper. Run with G's don't fuck with rappers. Lookin' drug dealing dapper hold that papers but I'm mapping

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Hunned mil whole big faces. Might buy a hunned Rollies, all big faces. Ducking them Dick Tracy's. Cagayan Laceys
AP Roll, AP stones, Corevy like '80. This that yap money bet that all no chop money. Trip around the world at same time I'm dicking down your girl. I'm on the PJ with my PJ's I ain't sleep yet. With these back to back ? like 3 Jets. Might buy the foam and just grow the green like a Chia Pet. Filled with all green just like the hulk will make me upset. You gon fuck around? It get someone killed
When you talkin' big numbers like a hunned mil

[Hook]

[Verse 3: David Rush]
You said a hunned million dollars let me tell 'em how it feel to be rich. You said there's 14 bricks right there? I paid in full how
It feel to be Mitch. I want the finer things in life I'm talkin' Louie, Fendy, Prada. Then I sit back and I think damn it all started
From a dollar. Now I can't wait to see what a hunned million dollar really feel like. I know I'll be sitting pretty, a nigga lookin' real
Right. I bet it feel good to count through all that money come through them stacks. But it's hard to say I know that money won't bring
My Mama back. These niggas won't hold me back. Rozay already told ya'll that. Take the money fold all that back then hit the scene
And double all those racks. A stack in my pocket a stack in my stash. Make 'em talk slow when it come to this cash. Make it too slow
When it's going to fast. Pray that I make it last

[Hook]The Day After Tomorrow, The Day After Tomorrow

[Verse 1:]
Look, I'm not the dude that I used to be
Not the dog from the hood on the block that you used to see
Life changed now, things ain't what they used to be
Fans wanna touch me, the industry is new to me
Gettin' deeper, this life I'm addicted
Caught up in this world, I'm a fiend, no prescription
Used to be a crook, now I feel like I'm a victim
What happened to the old names, people say they miss them
Maybe I'm a hypocrite, I've been on some different shit
Said I wouldn't change but I did, I'm admittin' it
Guess I wasn't ready for that fame and exposure
People taking pictures gettin' richer can't slow up
Hopin' for tomorrow, tomorrow really came
Sittin' in that jail cell, it was just a dream
It was just a dream that turned into reality
Find myself slippin' tryin' to hold to reality

[Hook:]
It was just a dream, money and the fame
Hopin' for tomorrow, tomorrow really came
Don't tell me that I changed, I'm still Jermaine
The day after tomorrow, tomorrow really came [x2]

The day after tomorrow, the day after tomorrow
Yeah, I made it, yea, look

[Verse 2:]
I made it, got away from drugs and gunshots
Standing on the beach far away from range drops
Look at me loungin', girls drop blouses
Back to the club, gettin' drunk spendin' thousands
In and out of sport cars, baby this the fast life
Sittin' in the hotel, reflectin' on my past life
Used to key work in a jacket on my jean suit
Now I'm in the press, whilin' out, catchin' lawsuits
Shoot for the stars, my mother always told me
But she ain't prepare me for this life with my homies
Tryin' to stay real in the industry that's fake
I ain't tryina sell my soul but I'm tryina get this cake
Tryin' to get it done, seven room mansion
Parties by the pool, model bitches dancin'
It was just a dream, fame is what I paid for
How can I complain, it's the life that I prayed for

[Hook x2][Intro: Juganot]
Gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Remix!))
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough (Uh Huh!)
I gotta gets the cash, I gotta gets the dough UH! (Juganot baby!)
I gotta get it, got, gots to get it come on!!! (Joell hit 'em!!!)

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz] (Juganot)
Pennies, nickels and dimes and quarters, dollars and fives
And, tens, twenties, fifties and hundreds gotta be mine
I'm a product of poverty I would like to be fine
One day no Honda, Maserati reclined
No mice in the trap no roaches in the kitchen
People the size of me on their latest televiison (UH!)
Lounge downstairs full bar nice women (Uh Huh!)
And somethin out back in case shorty like swimmin
YEAH!!!

[Verse Two: Juganot]
Gimme a dollar for all the women that hollered
After hearin me on radio spittin that yada yada (Yeah)
Uh! I have alot enough to buy myself a yacht and sail
Away to somewhere hot about a hundred knots an hour (HA!)
Sippin on Coladas how you doin pretty mama? (HEY!)
If this is all a dream you can leave me in the coma (UH HUH)
Cause I don't wanna 'wake and have to deal with all the drama
Tryin to make it in America, etcetera, etcetera
Gotta get the cheddar up!

[Hook: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?!

[Verse Three: Cassidy]
The more money I make the more money I need
Cause I still got bills still got tummies to fee
And a bunch of these responsibilities is killin me
To pay bills I'll move that Hillary is you feelin me?
I got the Bentley I got the Benz I got the Beamer
And I got the watch full of frozen Aquafina's
I hug the block cause I love the gwop
I need a dollar like Juganot, cuz you a thug or not?

[Verse Four: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Bring Havoc when a team move Mobb Deep
Alot of niggas claim King I'm the marquee
Big bankroll life in the fast lane
Benjamins behind me like Andre's last name (WHAT ELSE!!!)
Remix that a bang for the whole winter
I'm a gold member, you a goal tender
Ciroc boy, never sober
Y'all takin orders, we takin over

[Bridge: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc] (Papoose)
Well I don't know If I'm walkin on solid ground
Cause everything around me is, crumblin down
And all I want is, someone, to help meeeeeeee!!!!! (Papoose! Pa-poose!!!)

[Verse Five: Papoose]
I'll take a cow from a farmer feed it to all you cowards
Y'all can have the beef, all I want is the dollars
He workin out, he think he diesel like the sour
He can have the steroids all I want is the dollars
They knocked down the towers, build a mosque tomorrow
They dirty, give 'em blood bath and led showers
How can we have a tornado in Brooklyn?
It came from Hell's kitchen what is the devil cookin?!

[Verse Six: Maino]
Man you don't even know what I'll do for a dollar
Push a nigga mama off the roof for a dollar
Hop out the bushes with the tek for a dollar (DAMN)
Wouldn't wanna see me stress for a dollar
"Cause I get it poppin, just for a Porche
And my chick want a bag and my boy need Jordan's
Big body Benz no tints I'm bossin
The thought of bein broke just makes me nauseous

[Hook: Sample from "I Need A Dollar" by Aloe Blacc]
I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Well I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need (HEY! HEY!)
Said I need a dollar, dollar, dollar that's what I need
And If I share with you my story, would you share yo' dollar with me?![Intro: Tweezie]
And so I'm a dreamer
And so I'm a dreamer

[Hook: Tweezie]
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Cause I ain't end up in that ah-ah-aisle
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Now all I do is ball
Cause I ain't end up in that oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Maino]
How you want it, how you want it
All I see is Ghosts and Phantoms, my life haunted
How you want it, how you want it
Started from the bottom, I made it barely with nothing
Now I'm waking up when I (feel like it)
Going by when I (feel like it)
Fly where ever I (feel like it)
Wino (cause I feel like it)
I went to sleep with them Bugatti dreams
Shorty got a dirty mouth, but that punani clean
Talking rags to riches, diamonds on ashy wristses
Models and actresses, now they the average bitches
Yeah, you now rolling with the mafia
Matte black Ghost, biscuit in and ride with us

[Pre-Hook: Tweezie]
So I'm a dreamer
I want it all, man I come from the bottom
I ain't had nothing at all
And so I'm a dreamer
I want it all
Man I be going off
Cause I ain't going back to poor

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I had a dream, Martin Luther King
I was Pablo Escobar when he got them things
I was Michael Jordan when he got them rings
I was Usain Bolt when he got them chains
I was Vince Carter on the fast break
Marley, on his last take
Puff, when he had Ma$e
All we had was hope, all we had was dope
Look at the crib, look at the boat
Look at the car, baby, watch it grow wings
They say when you make money, you gon' lose friends
Well fuck em all, motherfuck them all
We was never friends anyway, nigga watch me ball

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
When you come from where we come from
You get used to feeling hunger
You get used to the feeling of pain
The villan that reigns, of being a number
These influences that I'm under
These phone bills that I run up
From the Netherlands to downtown Japan
To Australia pimping down under
You can probably tell that I'm high
By the way a nigga fell from the sky
Every story that I tell, you can tell if it's real
You can tell if it's not
You can tell that I lived every moment
Most niggas gonna try to sell you a plot
You can tell that the fucks that I don't give
Never went broke since I failed junior high
How ironic is it, you like, wow, that's some decision
But look at how I came up, that's what they call commitment
By far no competition to a nigga's disposition
How ya want it, how ya want it?
Bitch, I flaunt it cause I did it
Ya bish!

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]True Story

[Verse 1: Maino]
Look, I had a homie that used to tell me I would blow
But he died before he got to see me blow
Got killed, never thought I'd see him go
No funerals, I don't even wanna go
At his wake man I was just standing
And had the guts to see him in the casket
Damn, that's my nigga in that casket
In a million years I never would imagine
So I'm going out looking for my dawg
On the block getting bent for my dawg
God tell me why it hurt so bad
Why you take "little buck" why you take "Rav"
So I'm up nights cryin' on and off again
Drinkin' Henney, it makes me feel strong again
I don't wanna spend a day sober
I wanna feel numb all over

[Hook: Maino]
It feels like I'm floating on the clouds man (I'm High)
Things got to fly away (no lie)
I'mma drink my pain away (Oh god)
Let me see another day
Now we going get (right right right)
Let's get (right right right)
I feel so (right right right)
I wanna get (right right right)

[Verse 2: Maino]
Look, have you ever heard the cries of a broken man
Stared into the eyes of a hopeless man
No lies look I know this man
True Story I had went down on Gates Ave
Stray bullets flying out every where
Put my lil' man Moms in a wheelchair
And I don't even know what I should say to him
Cause I feel like, I can't relate to him
At the hospital, my eyes waterin'
Give anything to see Cory walk again
Type of shit makes me think about giving up
Put my pain in a white Styrofoam cup
I won't drink cause' I'm thirstin' (hey)
I drink cuz' I'm hurtin' (hey)
Greygoose, got me stumblin'
Man, I don't wanna feel nothing

[Hook: Maino]
It feels like I'm floating on the clouds man (I'm High)
Things got to fly away (no lie)
I'mma drink my pain away (Oh god)
Let me see another day
Now we goin' get (right right right)
Let's get (right right right)
I feel so (right right right)
I wanna get (right right right)

[Verse 3: Maino]
Yeah, and I don't wanna feel no pain no more
Somebody tell me why when it rains it pours
Feels like I'm wasting my life away
I'm high and I think I can fly away
More hennessy, niggas smoking weed
Can't hardly see, whats in front of me
What is wrong with me, what it's coming to
Somebody help me look at what I'm going through
I need another shot of patron
I don't wanna face the world on my own
I got friends that ain't never coming home
They call me and I try to tell them stay strong
He said Maino my life is all blown
My son gon' have grandkids when I come home
Damn, I could feel his pain through the phone
And all I could tell him was

[Hook: Maino]
It feels like I'm floating on the clouds man (I'm High)
Things got to fly away (no lie)
I'mma drink my pain away (Oh god)
Let me see another day
Now we goin' get (right right right)
Let's get (right right right)
I feel so (right right right)
I wanna get (right right right)As soon as we see em, I'm a pull over you goin hop out
Don't say a word, walk up to em
Put the clip in his mouth
Then jump back up in the whip
Don't leave the gun that's movie shit
We goin use that same joint again
I peel off, runnin through the stop signs
Foot up on the gas, got a car full of hot iron
I'm flyin hand on the steering wheel, other on the semi kid
Fuck the police, I'll show em what a Hemi is
You shoot em up I'm the getaway driver, speeding up the runway
Holdin the 4 5 up, we jus niggas then merc up in and smile at em
You ready then hop in nigga and we goin ride up

You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver

You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver

Yea cops can't catch me, I'm a boss in a Porsche truck
And the Charger, the Patrón got me charged up
Flying on that highway, police right behind me
Swerving in and out of lanes, turn the wheel sideways
I'm a treat it like a lay, homie you ain't gotta pay
You can pop sumthin nigga bet I get us outta here
I'm a push the seat back put the muzik on blast
The way I drive is like I'm flyin in a spacecraft
Cadillac matching whip snappin green land and shit
Black bandana on my head, ones on my wrist
You wanna getaway, you ain't gotta a way
I'm outside, engine running, we goin getaway

You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver
Getaway getaway getaway driver

You shoot em up and I'm the getaway driver
Hop in my car I'm the getaway driver
The cops comin I'm the getaway driver

Rubber band up, all white down
Three hundred twenties for the whole pound
Big block gators, fresh pair of Marcs
599, brand new Ferrari
Remix, yeah nigga get it
Million dollar nigga, money be my best friend
Yo Gotti!

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I got my city on my back, my diamonds on my front
Conjure up in my cup, granddaddy in my blunt
Did it 2000 and whatever, the year is after this is
Cadillac shoes and the jazzy yellow misses
Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

[Verse 5: Diamond]
I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

[Verse 6: Shawty Lo]
Do it shawty, let me say
Shawty Lo do it B.I.G
I like a lot of hoes and I love the freaks

Middle finger to a hater
You remember me? Big Uf
Purp in mine, what’s in yo cup?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Wiz Khalifa]

Give the hoes what they need, give the people what they want
Uhh, I don’t fuck with no blunts

Wizzle man, rollin’ out the big bag
With a bad bitch, light brown skin thick ass
Never slow, I get mine quick fast
Gettin’ money in this bitch ass

[Verse 8: Maino]
Standin’ on the couch in club with a pocket full of c-notes
Niggas can’t tell me I ain’t bigger then Nino
Hop up in the Coupe, give it gas I’m floatin’
Money getting’ big like the arms on Hulk Hogan
Stacks on top of stacks, baby this is IHOP
I be runnin’ down on sacks, auto I shop
Everything is big, big chain keep a big chrome
Big house big truck, big body red bone

Seen my dick, and thought it was the bedpole

Some broads they can barely walk when I'm done with 'em
Call the ambulance man to come get 'em

Wanna thrash me then don't walk past me
And when you pass me just holla at me and say
