[Hook]
It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

[Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gift when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

[Hook]

[Joe Fatal]
Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

[Hook]

[Akinyele]
Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick in lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

[Hook]

[Large Professor]
I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Oooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass

[Hook x4][Introduction: Large Professor]
Now I've never been one to knock the next man for getting his
You know what
I'm saying? (Right, right)
And I do realize that now hip-hop is a form of
Showbiz (Uh huh)
But this has always been something with which you have to be
True
So in the year on 1992...(this is how we do!)

[Verse 1: Large Professor]
At the age of 19, heard the scene
A lot of M.C.'s that do not come clean
Fronting on dealing hard times in rhymes
You see him in the streets and you see no signs
Of the hell, and they get on stage and tell
Some cornball war story, ring the bell (word)
You're fakin' the funk
Talking that extra hard junk, you're probably a punk
And I'mma let you know, that this way
You just don't cut with the artificial flow

[Verse 2: Neek the Exotic]
Neek the Exotic breaks backs and necks
When fakes try to front, they get smoked like blunts
My rhymes penetrate like skunk
Ayo word up, I think you're fakin' the funk

[Large Professor]
You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk)

[Hook:]
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk) [x6]

[Verse 3: Large Professor]
You do a song about a current event
Get on television and seem hesitant to represent
And that's what we call fraud
You can't kick the streets with a "Look, I sold out" award (word)
And everywhere has streets
That's not trying to hear the same wack rhymes
Over the same stink beats
Cause times are real, and I can't feel
Putting...down on the reel to reel

[Verse 4: Neek the Exotic]
Now I'm a let you know
With those weak style of raps, it's time to go
I eject rejects that step
I'm a vet ready to snap your neck
I shine and rhyme at the same time
The mastermind of the sport called the rhyme
Now it's my time to dump chumps that front
(Ayo Professor what's up?)

[Large Professor]
You're fakin' the funk

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Large Professor]
The era of the wack M.C
Is getting shut down when the Main Source stomps through your town
Cause we don't play the role of a clown
And keep things jumping with the real rap sound

[Verse 6: Large Professor and Neek the Exotic]
So to all the people stealing beats (You're fakin' the funk)
To the crossover rapper with the pleats (You're fakin' the funk)
To all the chumps that's claiming the streets (You're fakin' the funk)
Fronting incredible feats (You're fakin' the funk)
To the girl acting like a prostitute (You're fakin' the funk)
Wearing that hooker type suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the rapper with the big space suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the artist that doesn't pay dues (You're fakin' the funk)

[Verse 7: Neek the Exotic]
Cause, exotic and then you're torn with the hyper tone
I can't be blown because my rhymes are hard like stone
So prepare for the scare, because I'm you're worst nightmare, punk
Cause you're fakin' the

[Hook][Verse 1]
We fight every night, now that's not kosher
I reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
And wake up to be greeted by an argument again
You act like you're ten
So immature, I try to concentrate on a cure
And keep lookin' at the front door
Thinkin' if I were to evacuate
You'd probably be straighter than straight
And wouldn't have so much hate
Cause you don't know the pain I feel when I see you smilin'
And when I roll up you start wilin'
So I front like everything's hunky-dory
But it's a whole different story
You don't like the fact that I'm me
I don't put on a show
When it comes time for you to have company
And your friends don't understand your choice of man
They speak proper while my speech is from a garbage can
But regardless, you shouldn't have to be so raw
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]
I'm lookin' at the front door
Baby, I'm lookin' at the front door
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Verse 2]
And when you're with your friends, I glide to the side
Until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
But when they're not around, the fights commence
I'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
Cause I'm the one that you claim to love for life
But all I get is gray hairs and strife
And I can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
And get foul every time you lose control
But that's not my order of operations
So I should win an award for lots of patience
Cause that's all a fella can have
With a girl who's shootin' up his world like Shaft
And I don't think that I can take it anymore
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My friends always tell me how I'm lucky to possess
The best looking girl in the whole U.S
But every time you scream, you blow your finesse
Tryin' to dis the Professor
Twenty-four hours of acting sore
Sometimes I wish you'd come down with lockjaw
So I don't have to take in the breakin'
You treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
It seems like just two years
Back when we were bonded and not pierced
But now I keep itchin' to jet
Sitting' in the chair just to stare, set to sprint
Yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
I say it now like I said it before
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]Verse One:

[Blam] Aww shit, another young brother hit
I better go over my man's crib and get the pump
Cause to the cops, shootin brothers is like playin baseball
And they're never in a slump
I guess when they shoot up a crew, it's a grand slam
And when it's one, it's a home run
But I'mma be ready with a wild pitch
My finger got a bad twitch, plus I'm on the switch --
-- side, and step up to the batter's box
Fuck red and white, I got on Black Sox
But let him shoot a person from the White Sox
What's the call? Foul ball!
Babe Ruth woulda made a good cop, but he didn't
Instead he was a bigot, dig it
My life is valuable and I protect it like a gem
Instead of cops shootin' me I'm goin out shootin' them
And let em cough up blood like phlegm
It's grim [blam blam] but dead is my antonym
And legally they can't take a fall
Yo check it out it's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Two:

R.B.I. -- real bad injury
But don't get happy you're in jail for a century
Just as bad as bein shot in the groin
To see who'll shoot ya, they'll flip a coin
And watch him run for the stretch
But you don't know the man is at home waitin to make the catch
So the outfielder guns you down
You're out, off to the dugout, underground
I know a cop that's savage, his pockets stay green like cabbage
Cause he has a good batting average
No questions, just pulls out the flamer
[Blam] And his excuses get lamer
Once a brother tried to take a leave
But they shot him in his face sayin he was tryin to steal a base
And people watch the news for coverage on the game
Hmm, and got the nerve to complain
They need to get themselves a front row seat
Or sink a baseline for a beat
Cause television just ain't designed for precision y'all
It's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Three:

A kid caught on, but I don't know where the brother went
The umpires are the government
I guess they took him out the game, and replace him
With a pinch-hitter, in the scam he was a quitter
So the cops usually torment, I mean tournament
Win em I was sayin
You can't let the umpires, hear ya speak and battle
Like the other kid you won't be playin
Cause they'll beat you til your ass drop
A walking gun with a shell in his hand is their mascot
And when you run around let it be known to step lightly
The bases are loaded
My man got out from three strikes
In the skull but the knife he was carrying was dull
Instead of innings, we have endings
What a fine way to win things
And hot-dog vendors have fun
Sellin you the cat rat and dog on a bun
And when you ask what is all of this called?
It's just a friendly game of baseballAyo, straight up and down on the reel to real, if you
Drug abusing child abusers don't get your shit
Right now, your children might grow up like this

He was born in a jail cell, cause his moms was a con
And in his mother's cupped arms was a newborn timebomb
But it wasn't his fault he was in the caged vault for aggravated assault
On his eight-year-old sister
As Mr. Daddy stood there, instead he should have dissed her
And now mommy's found guilty
Cause she almost beat her daughter to death for spilling a glass of milk
See
Poppa was a boozer, momma was a drug abuser
They were no-win losers
And now Sonny's gotta struggle
And another day of life to him's another day of trouble
You gotta live this life for you to try and understand
The diary of a hitman

The diary of a hitman

Sonny's making money on the norm and you know he's got another job
When you see him with them leather gloves on
He got a look in his eye like he wants to die
Packing the nine double murder near his thigh
10 G's a head, whoever you want dead
Will be filled with lead, and be buried in their own red
He don't sleep at night, because he's just like an owl
On the prowl and his lifestyle's foul
A self-made boss and the thoughts of his moms and pops
Is what really ticks him off
A flashback from the past, dad whipping mom's ass
For the cash, after that she hit the stash
And takes a blast of the trash she was hooked on
And Sonny felt helpless, as he looked on
You gotta live this life for you to try and understand
The diary of a hitman

The diary of a hitman

Sonny got a call from the mob
It was 100,000 grand for my man to do a quick job
The contract was plain and simple
One in the mouth for talking, then two to the temple
The address looked kinda funny
But Sonny didn't care who was there, cause he was in it for the money
He made his way to the crime spot, the victim
With nothing on his mind at the time but to get him
He arrived at 10 o'clock and didn't even knock
He just shot off the lock
And he kicked the door open
Destined to smoke him, nope, Sonny wasn't joking
He made his way up the stairs, and there's
Mommy in tears, and daddy in fear
But he didn't give a damn cause he never had a fam
So now it's time to silence the lamb
Momma took the first three, so now she's living drug free
Cause she's put out of misery
And Daddy's on his knees yelling "Please Sonny please"
But Sonny squeezed
You had to live this life for you to try and understand

"If something is yours by right
Then fight for it, or shut up..."

Sí, aquí estamos con el Main Source
Con el Profesor Grande, Sir Scratch y K-Cut
Y vamos a hablar de los rappers que no pueden cantar

Rappers can dance sing and shake their thing at the same time
But can't rhyme
They probably think that as long as they gettin paid
They can sleep in the shade but they'll fall like a cascade
While I drop skills over drum fills
They'll try to pick up some, and still sound slum
Cause they didn't learn the fundamentals
At this, and I insist that they get dissed
For fraud, their weak rap tunes keep me bored
Sword, due to the type of bullshit they record
Hey and I make em concentrate on the songs I create
And kids can't wait to get they fork knife and plate
So they can chew what I serve with the nerve
To call themselves real, but I know the deal
So I just place all the cards on the trap
Tell them to cut the crap, now let's rap

Sí, ahí estaba el hablando de esos rappers
Que siempre están bailando
Y que no saben lo que están haciendo
Porque no saben cantar
Pero el Profesor, él sí sabe lo que está haciendo
Y él tiene música muy buena
Y nunca está bailando como esos pendejos
Que siempre están bailando por ahí
Y Sir Scratch and K-Cut
Ellos sí que saben DJ muy bueno
Tú sabes lo que estoy diciendo?

Now all you rap clowns let's go the seven rounds
And put down your imaginary frown
Or take it to the streets, with multiple beats
Get as loose as you want, flaunt, no beeps
This time when you rhyme it won't be for a rock show
It'll be on the block so
We can work like strainers, or filters
And find out all remainders and the best builders
Cause so many MC's get star struck
Get on stage and find out that they're washed up
Cause some new jack took em out
But they was sleepin so what's the surprised look about
It ain't hard to tell that your records sell
Because your rhymes smell and people scared
Of a brother that drop the bombshell
So to show and prove the fact it's, important that you
Come and show your tactics, ASAP, let's rap

Aquí estamos hablando ahora de los rappers
Que se están olvidando de la calle
Y que están tratando de cambiar sus canciónes
Y no saben lo que están haciendo
Pero que ya saben que Main Source
Ellos no son nuevos de dónde vienen
Y vienen de la calle y quieren hacer música para la calle
Entienden? OK

Okay

Terror on wax, Large Professor K-Cut and Sir Skratch
Kickin it to kids that can't latch
On, to the meaning of a real rap song
Just producing corn, I like to warn
We build it up dis far without sellin out
And still got clout
So you continue to sell and be a sap
And when you're ready to snapback I tell you
Let's rap

Sí, porque la gente se están olvidando
Y están tratando de cambiar la mente de ellos
Pero que así no era el objeto de antes
Que es diferente ahora, entienden?
Pero que la gente yo no me explico como son, OK?
Pues aquí estámos diciendo paz, y adios[Hook]
I'm just hanging out (Repeat x2)

I'm mainly known for the rough raps
But kids steal my lyrics like hubcaps
And eat 'em like stacks of flapjacks like rugrats
Hey, and I get busy over unknown tracks
While the next man flaps his lids like Parkay
I'm skilled in the field, so slide to the side
I'll make a rapper cry, cause I can get some shut-eye
While he's having hard times writing rhymes
So he gnaws on my metaphors and dines on my lines
Which is the reason why I like to hang out and
Hustle with my friends, to get away from pens
And copiers, so I'm Corona bound
To check Drew aka Doc the Butcher and what's going down
And Joe with the Jetta enables us to get around town
He's a clown
Other than that I'm with Joe Burgos
Watch an old Black Caesar flick for kicks
Jump in the wagon and we're outta here without an idea of where
But usually we wind up there
I go over K-Cut's block cause rock cuts is what he blends
Check it, and I like to hang out and hustle with my friends

[Hook]

And I be up in Mt. Vernon, piecing, with CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Making beats that are sharper than cleats
With my man Grippy Grip from the Cafe Black Rose
Checking out videos
And I speak with my man Ralik
On the problems of the weak dumb and meek, my man's deep
Like the kid from the Bridge named the rapper Nas
Me and G collect money in bars
And I run through discotheques like sound
Royal Rich is profound, yelling free James Brown
We rustle up to the discotheque and
Hustle up a storm in a swarm like we on form
Nobody can get with the whereabouts cause we're out
Shuffling feet without a shadow of a doubt
From Flushing to the streets of New York and back
Freshly dipped off the rack, but not the Van Grack
In the park making plans for the night
Everything's right, taking it light
Preparing for the festivities to begin
And every day seems like a day from the weekend
The cooling never ends
And I like to hang out and hustle with my friends

[Hook]My 4-9-3-11 has fleas cause when I'm kicking the lip service
Someone signs up to rush the potteries
It's automatic and apparent that we have skills in this
But people tend to miss when we shoot the gift
It's not to imitate another in minute
That's slouch life to crush a bad gimmick
We like to shoot the breeze the Main Source way
We don't portray another and never will perpetrate any horseplay
Meaning that if there's a special request
For the Main Source to bite, don't hold your breath
Routines are the lessons, any questions?
We're kicking essence, the Main Source breaks the atom

Since I'm part of the Source others try to find a lunch
And the passengers kicked by me, but I don't crunch
They know what I publish ain't rubbish, it's soon to fit a day
I fine tune kids, two tutor and away
They go through my book, look, pick and snatch
But I can understand cause they create chicken scratch
The center of attention, kids keep snitching
Phoney like an extention, trying to front like they gain attention
But at the same time dumbfounded
They started idolizing the Source as soon as the drums sounded
The Actual's intervened to tell you that I'm...
The Main Source breaks the atom

We're not the best cause no one should be considered a champ
We're the Source and so-called comp will receive a stamp
For playing participation and also for being nosey
The camera's on you, chief, so don't blow it Holmes
By looking and peeking cause if you understand Hell
As quick as I give you howdy I bid you farewell
You'd better think before you break cause if you step to us
That'll be the very last step you take
Consider yourself the outer shell of a dungling part
What we write will bang in your heart
Grab your place in line, get your application signed
And in due time you'll find the Main Source breaks atomAyo, straight up and down on the reel to real, if you

Niggas been sleeping for a long time you know what I'm saying?
Bout time to represent one time for the motherfucker
Cos Main Source is in the motherfucking house baby pa

Yeah, I pump it up and I don't quit for jack
I'm back to rap on wax now guess who's back
The chart hitter, not a quitter nor a bullshitter
These cats know I'm the best one out the litter
Yeah, they talk, but they be talking diarrhea
Cause none of them got the capability to be a-
Nother Mikey D cause I ain't having it, kid
You can do what I did, yo nigga how the fuck you biddin?
I've been through wars and I came out untouched
I'm too much, whenever the microphone is in my clutch
I get props, I get stopped by the cops
That's how it is hops, when my tape's in a box
I've been through crews like a ho
And took em out, I always let niggas know
I keep the soul cause I'm a lyrical pro
I play it mellow, word em up, I'm on the down low

Know what I'm saying, shit is real, G, I'm on the down low
Gotta represent in '94, I'm on the down low
K-Cut and Sir Scratch, LTD, shit, we on the down low
Coming up with motherfucking platinum shit
You know what I'm saying?

Uno of Mikey D's freestyles is rougher than a rapper with practice
I'm fantastic, true meaning of what bad is
15 years on the scene, could never fall back
A small pack, and fucking right, I think I'm all that
You know a nigga with a doubt?
Well you can bring him to my session and watch me take him out
He'll RIP when I rip him and I stick him
In a body bag then I'm gonna zip him
I'll throw him in the ocean, and watch him sink
Cause he shouldn't waste ink on them rhymes wasting time
Cause them rhymes stink
Mikey D's reanimated and these other rappers hate it
I got skills, they can't fade it
I keep the soul cause I'm a lyrical pro
I play it mellow, word, I'm on the down low

Twin Towers in the house, on the down low
Word up, Shaqueen in the motherfucker, she on the down low
Different Shades of Black in the motherfucking house, on the down low
Word up, everybody out here is on the down low
Know what I'm saying, my man Monte, Laurelton nigga, he's on the down low
MC Lotto, Bomb Squad, all the motherfuckers I know, they on the down low
Big motherfucking Cee Lo, Red, Mark Miller, they on the down low
Boom bash in '94, know what I'm saying
Everybody in this motherfucker's on the down low

Wearing that hooker type suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the rapper with the big space suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the artist that doesn't pay dues (You're fakin' the funk)

[Verse 7: Neek the Exotic]
Cause, exotic and then you're torn with the hyper tone
I can't be blown because my rhymes are hard like stone
So prepare for the scare, because I'm you're worst nightmare, punk
Cause you're fakin' the

[Hook][Verse 1: Large Professor]
Man, I had soul since I was negative three months old
When it came to getting down I was bold
Kicking steps until you had to put my ass in a choke hold
And damn near wouldn't fold
Check the picture with the apple jack hat
My father even taught me how to skat
So I developed the skat into what we call rap
And get nasty at that
Getting loose is not a problem, it's getting back together
I pull girls like a lever, I get tired
Bring the coffee to my lips and watch the Large Professor do backflips

He got so much soul, he don't need no music (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2: Large Professor]
I possess skills in the field of rapping
So get down cause I make it happen
Pop with a limp, low pro pimp
I make other MC's mope
Cause their skills ain't developed like negatives
Throughout the years, I've done mega kids
So don't fix your mouth you say I can't handle
I got more sole than a sandal
Cooler than a liter of digital soundproof
I raise the roof (Ain't that the truth)
Got money in the bank, baby pah, I'm a star

He got so much soul, he don't need no music (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 3: Large Professor]
I rip rappers up like a card
(Yo Large Professor I want to battle)
Man, you're sorry
I'm part of the Main Source
And we eat DJ's and MC's as the main course
For dinner, lunch, brunch, you better break fast
Cause I'll eat your whole bunch
Or crew, your girl's stuck to me like glue
Cause I kick it like a class of kung fu
I use a pick in my hair without force
You use a lawn mower, you got peat moss
Growing on your dome, that's why you're so dumb
I'll eat you like a plum
Messing with the brother on the beat
I share the rhymes that are kicking like feet
So don't let me start, holmes
Because I'll pull your chart

He got so much soul, he don't need no music (Repeat 4x)* features Mikey D as the rapper instead of the Large Professor

(Verse 1:)
Now I'm a flip the track and bring you back to reality
I'm like Wesley Snipes, I act without a salary
Cause I don't need nobody saying "Lights, Camera, Action!"
I act on reaction
Fuck what you see on television
Cause nowadays all of us live in the hellavision
On every single channel it's the same old same
Brothers' poppin their brain
Or gettin wrecked at a soccer game
Six brothers fallin victim to the street
Aftermath of the drive-by rolling in the black jeep
Every other channel spent its money on the talk shows
From Oprah to Geraldo, everybody in New York knows
But when a brother gets real
They make the story opposite
And try to offer niggas raw deals

(Chorus:)
Television tells lies to the vision
The world's a prison
We're livin in hellavision

(Verse 2:)
Every day your life to me is drama
But not the type of drama that my T.V. shows
Because it makes the drama calmer
When a lady's caught cheatin
She steps with the next man
And doesn't even catch a ass-beatin
Reality check - that's what the T.V. said
Cause in real life it's two to the fuckin head
Yosemite Sam filling Bugs with slugs
Wile E. Coyote always cooking up these deadly drugs
Bart Simpson is cursing up a storm
And children love this shit man, come on
I see kids that say bringing guns to school
Ten year old crack heads and that ain't cool
My four year old daughter curses worse than Bart
Straight from my heart, it's tearing me apart
(Chorus)

(Verse 3:)
And now, hip hop is labelled as a violencer
Like everyone who rhymes packs a tech with the silencer
Every other month a hip hopper goes to prison
Over some dumb shit or for the real life living
But who's to know what we've been going through
When all you see is one side of us
The side the T.V. be showing you
You never hear about the stress or the work
Or the hard times we had or hip hop was getting jerked
You only see us in the limelight
But when the night comes, we're always linked to crime, right?
Man - what I've been through is strife
Yo - they could make fifty movies of my motherfucking life
And there's a million like me
The people you don't see
When you watch your everyday T.V

(Chorus)Verse One:

[Blam] Aww shit, another young brother hit
I better go over my man's crib and get the pump
Cause to the cops, shootin brothers is like playin baseball
And they're never in a slump
I guess when they shoot up a crew, it's a grand slam
And when it's one, it's a home run
But I'mma be ready with a wild pitch
My finger got a bad twitch, plus I'm on the switch --
-- side, and step up to the batter's box
Fuck red and white, I got on Black Sox
But let him shoot a person from the White Sox
What's the call? Foul ball!
Babe Ruth woulda made a good cop, but he didn't
Instead he was a bigot, dig it
My life is valuable and I protect it like a gem
Instead of cops shootin' me I'm goin out shootin' them
And let em cough up blood like phlegm
It's grim [blam blam] but dead is my antonym
And legally they can't take a fall
Yo check it out it's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Two:

R.B.I. -- real bad injury
But don't get happy you're in jail for a century
Just as bad as bein shot in the groin
To see who'll shoot ya, they'll flip a coin
And watch him run for the stretch
But you don't know the man is at home waitin to make the catch
So the outfielder guns you down
You're out, off to the dugout, underground
I know a cop that's savage, his pockets stay green like cabbage
Cause he has a good batting average
No questions, just pulls out the flamer
[Blam] And his excuses get lamer
Once a brother tried to take a leave
But they shot him in his face sayin he was tryin to steal a base
And people watch the news for coverage on the game
Hmm, and got the nerve to complain
They need to get themselves a front row seat
Or sink a baseline for a beat
Cause television just ain't designed for precision y'all
It's just a friendly game of baseball

Verse Three:

A kid caught on, but I don't know where the brother went
The umpires are the government
I guess they took him out the game, and replace him
With a pinch-hitter, in the scam he was a quitter
So the cops usually torment, I mean tournament
Win em I was sayin
You can't let the umpires, hear ya speak and battle
Like the other kid you won't be playin
Cause they'll beat you til your ass drop
A walking gun with a shell in his hand is their mascot
And when you run around let it be known to step lightly
The bases are loaded
My man got out from three strikes
In the skull but the knife he was carrying was dull
Instead of innings, we have endings
What a fine way to win things
And hot-dog vendors have fun
Sellin you the cat rat and dog on a bun
And when you ask what is all of this called?
It's just a friendly game of baseball[Hook]
I'm just hanging out (Repeat x2)

I'm mainly known for the rough raps
But kids steal my lyrics like hubcaps
And eat 'em like stacks of flapjacks like rugrats
Hey, and I get busy over unknown tracks
While the next man flaps his lids like Parkay
I'm skilled in the field, so slide to the side
I'll make a rapper cry, cause I can get some shut-eye
While he's having hard times writing rhymes
So he gnaws on my metaphors and dines on my lines
Which is the reason why I like to hang out and
Hustle with my friends, to get away from pens
And copiers, so I'm Corona bound
To check Drew aka Doc the Butcher and what's going down
And Joe with the Jetta enables us to get around town
He's a clown
Other than that I'm with Joe Burgos
Watch an old Black Caesar flick for kicks
Jump in the wagon and we're outta here without an idea of where
But usually we wind up there
I go over K-Cut's block cause rock cuts is what he blends
Check it, and I like to hang out and hustle with my friends

[Hook]

And I be up in Mt. Vernon, piecing, with CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Making beats that are sharper than cleats
With my man Grippy Grip from the Cafe Black Rose
Checking out videos
And I speak with my man Ralik
On the problems of the weak dumb and meek, my man's deep
Like the kid from the Bridge named the rapper Nas
Me and G collect money in bars
And I run through discotheques like sound
Royal Rich is profound, yelling free James Brown
We rustle up to the discotheque and
Hustle up a storm in a swarm like we on form
Nobody can get with the whereabouts cause we're out
Shuffling feet without a shadow of a doubt
From Flushing to the streets of New York and back
Freshly dipped off the rack, but not the Van Grack
In the park making plans for the night
Everything's right, taking it light
Preparing for the festivities to begin
And every day seems like a day from the weekend
The cooling never ends
And I like to hang out and hustle with my friends

[Hook]I'll advance to your backside, foot and put
Nine prints and diss a meantimes, where the sun don't shine
So get a flash of the spotlight fast
You got kicked in the ass by the man with the eyes of glass
Slide from me you money kicking the dull crap
I'll make your skull snap, seeing me all at
In this here field my foot equals yield
Your brain is simple and revealed while mine is sealed
Coming up with the archeological finds
Funk drums allow me to spark you with rhymes
The mic's my instrument, my skills are infinite, catch a hint from it
Cause it's the Large Professor

While you was doing the butt, I was putting game down
You frowned before now you wear the same frown
Just as long as the buck I sit when I think
I couldn't care less who was jelling the Profess-or
Sir Scratch and K-Cut the Main Source
Back to break more atoms of course
With the beat no more melodious, votes I suprise folks
I'm as sharp as a toothpick, come and watch the youth kick
The game so tough cause the shine I'll scuff
Busting the fluff cause I'm just that tough
The mic's my instrument, my skills are infinite, catch a hint from it
Cause it's the Large Professor

I stomp supposed comp like a posse
Brothers try to squash me, so I speak harshly
On the constant truth of the Main Source crew
I peruse the place just to see what I can do
To stupid MC's whose rhymes sound fabricated
Heads get deflated when the Professor's untranslated
Style gets everyday play
Brothers on the butters can't flip the Parkay
Their mouths are sealed like Zip-Loc bags
Fake like wrestling and small like frags
The mic's my instrument, my skills are infinite, catch a hint from it
Cause it's the Large Professor

Finessing the songs like this, babblists get bust with the quickness
Baby hit the mist
You want to feel hard times, then friend say your rhymes
The results will be about 10 volts in your mind
I'll electrify, your brain is hollow like a tunnel
I squeeze out doubt like a funnel
I'm the MS rep on the microphone
If I say what you don't like, go home
That's why the places I play stay packed
You like what I say and you always come back
The mic's my instrument, my skills are infinite, catch a hint from it
Cause it's the Large Professor[Produced by Large Professor]

[Hook]
It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

[Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gift when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

[Hook]

[Joe Fatal]
Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

[Hook]

[Akinyele]
Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick in lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

[Hook]

[Large Professor]
I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Oooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass

[Hook x4][Verse 1]
We fight every night, now that's not kosher
I reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
And wake up to be greeted by an argument again
You act like you're ten
So immature, I try to concentrate on a cure
And keep lookin' at the front door
Thinkin' if I were to evacuate
You'd probably be straighter than straight
And wouldn't have so much hate
Cause you don't know the pain I feel when I see you smilin'
And when I roll up you start wilin'
So I front like everything's hunky-dory
But it's a whole different story
You don't like the fact that I'm me
I don't put on a show
When it comes time for you to have company
And your friends don't understand your choice of man
They speak proper while my speech is from a garbage can
But regardless, you shouldn't have to be so raw
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]
I'm lookin' at the front door
Baby, I'm lookin' at the front door
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Verse 2]
And when you're with your friends, I glide to the side
Until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
But when they're not around, the fights commence
I'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
Cause I'm the one that you claim to love for life
But all I get is gray hairs and strife
And I can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
And get foul every time you lose control
But that's not my order of operations
So I should win an award for lots of patience
Cause that's all a fella can have
With a girl who's shootin' up his world like Shaft
And I don't think that I can take it anymore
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My friends always tell me how I'm lucky to possess
The best looking girl in the whole U.S
But every time you scream, you blow your finesse
Tryin' to dis the Professor
Twenty-four hours of acting sore
Sometimes I wish you'd come down with lockjaw
So I don't have to take in the breakin'
You treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
It seems like just two years
Back when we were bonded and not pierced
But now I keep itchin' to jet
Sitting' in the chair just to stare, set to sprint
Yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
I say it now like I said it before
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook][Intro]
Set it off, set it off, set it off, set it
Set it off, set it off, set it off

[Jay aka Jadakiss]
I'm saying "What!" to niggas that act like wreck
When I flash the Tec and hit a nigga in his neck
With two slugs, blood is a sign of vic
And if his bitch wanna snitch she can bite the dick
That's my word, anything goes for the hoes
I'm snatching rings, earrings, jewels and clothes
From the ghetto, trying to get my hands on a ki
So fuck Mike cause niggas wanna be like me
They think I'm crazy, nigga, like a bag of dust
I don't listen to the fuss cause I'm trying to bust
With the motherfucking BM drop, 325
By the way, me and my crew, we real live
Get absurd and hit a nigga with the bloody birds
Niggas can't fuck around with the bloody words

[Sheik aka Sheek Louch]
A-yo, I buck shots at midnight like I'm a fucking crook
Do stick-ups, head North, get the cash and book
I make ends but it depends on the type of vic
If it's a dealer the Tec-9 will kill him quick
Who's to say if I won't, money, and if I will?
I let it rip and up close and watch your temple spill
Mad blood everywhere but who says I did it?
Bullets they caught but in my gun, it wouldn't have fitted
Cause I'm blasting with the cannon every fucking hour
.22s don't work, I need a double power
Watch your back for The Warlocks, hit the street
And stay low for the stray bullets past your meat
Mad young but I don't give a hoot
So I just pollute and kicking heads with my fucking boot
So put your dicks up, money, or head North
Or head for the border before my squad decide to set it off

[Hook]
Set it off, yo, set it off (Repeat 4X)

[MC Lotto]
I know you niggas don't want drama cause I'mma tear that ass out the frame
I was born insane and surrounded by the drug game
And ain't a damn thing changed, I still chill
With the Glock on the block trying to make a mill
Niggas is done for fun, so don't test, son
I find a victim and stick him and move to the next one
Serial killer, but I ain't after Captain Crunch
I murdered the Brady Bunch cause I'm out to lunch
Lost my brain in the drug game, I love to do the wrong thing
I make g's from selling ki's of cocaine
No judge can judge me, police can't touch me
Watch out, shit's about to get ugly
I got the Tec, so respect the Main Source
MC Lotto, yeah, I came to set it off

[Sha-Queen aka Ma Barker]
Yo, watch the evil spirit rise when niggas get me fed
I slash a bitch and leave her weave up in the bloodshed
A heartless bitch with a switch giving bitches stitches
I got a backyard that's full of fucking dead snitches
And plus this chick is flowing slick it's coming from the mental
No shame in my game, I'm aiming for your fucking temple
And plus I'm coming equipped with the mad styles
The niggas I kill will go down with chalk profiles
Yeah, you bloody roughneck, my style's damn good
The shit I kick is taking motherfuckers manhood
So all that shit you plan on talking yo, you won't be able
So watch your mouth before you catch a fist that rocks your cradle
And now you know my state of mind that I'm letting off
And any time that I rhyme I'm gonna set it off

[Hook]

[Mikey D]
Yo back the fuck up, before I catch a body
I'm giving niggas boxes
And that's including motherfucking hotties
So get your pistols and your posse if you think you can stop me
I open 'em up like a autopsy
I got a crew of niggas waiting for the combat
If we can't get you we stepping where your mom's at
So all that rah-rah shit gotta cease, I pop my leash
If it's beef you ain't leaving in one piece
I drink a forty and I take over 40 Blocks
Niggas with Glocks give me props, they say, "Shorty rocks"
From 40 Projects to 40 acres and a mule
Knock out a 40, then I'm knocking out 40 fools
If they ever try to get with the nitwit, forget this
The hitlist and crippling the witness
I gotta get it off, when I let it off
Straight up and down, motherfuckers, I set it off

[Hook x2]Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Rolling dice can help you or hurt you, your virtue is
Knowing when to quit cause you've hit your cash curfew
Even if you have to get swift and swindle
It's as long as you win, so close you're simple
I see people rolling dice with lives
Telling lies and cutting close like knives
For a sandwich and shelter, he'll probably sell the
Clothes on they man's back for fame and wealth or
Go with the next man's girl and hit the skins
Get in his face and say "Yo, we're best friends"
Scared of a tattle, because their tail shake like a rattle
And then you'll kiss behind like a saddle
That'll be the reason why you'll bleed from greed
Ready to diss your own brother at breakneck speed
You roll the dice real fast and think you're nice
But gotta be more precise
Cause I'll keep looking, and you'll keep scheming
I'll start hooking, and you'll be screaming
Starting a tries in a alibis
Cause you keep rolling snake eyes

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

The person you least expect to slit your neck
Nine times out of every ten crimes is the prime suspect
It doesn't feel good, when you can't trust blood
And your neighbor's the neighborhood hood
Plotting the cut neck scam
You sleeping in the end, you get swept cause you slept
You hear the dice get blown on so step back
Snakes attack and move as fast as a Cadillac
But if found in my circumference
The next day you'll pay to get your fronts fixed
Rolling 11 is the opposite of heaven
It's craps, so start revving to make tracks
Once a snake, you stay a snake
When you're small you took cookies, but now you take the cake
And talk behind backs, and switch facts
And tax, and probably smoke cracks
Cause one minute my crib you're all in it
The next day you wanna play self centered?
Just because you're in with the fake guys
And you keep rolling snake eyes

Yeah...

I watch people roll dice in the jungle of concrete
Where venom corrodes the streets
Where the girls get foul on the guys, why?
(They're rolling snake eyes!)
Where the guys get foul on their wives, why?
(They're rolling snake eyes!)
False producers are telling lies, why?
(They're rolling snake eyes!)
Policemen are taking bribes, why?
(They're rolling snake eyes!)
So here's the solution to the problem that lies ahead
Shoot a motherfucking snake dead
For rolling snake eyes[Co-produced by Pete Rock]

"If something is yours by right
Then fight for it, or shut up..."

Sí, aquí estamos con el Main Source
Con el Profesor Grande, Sir Scratch y K-Cut
Y vamos a hablar de los rappers que no pueden cantar

Rappers can dance sing and shake their thing at the same time
But can't rhyme
They probably think that as long as they gettin paid
They can sleep in the shade but they'll fall like a cascade
While I drop skills over drum fills
They'll try to pick up some, and still sound slum
Cause they didn't learn the fundamentals
At this, and I insist that they get dissed
For fraud, their weak rap tunes keep me bored
Sword, due to the type of bullshit they record
Hey and I make em concentrate on the songs I create
And kids can't wait to get they fork knife and plate
So they can chew what I serve with the nerve
To call themselves real, but I know the deal
So I just place all the cards on the trap
Tell them to cut the crap, now let's rap

Sí, ahí estaba el hablando de esos rappers
Que siempre están bailando
Y que no saben lo que están haciendo
Porque no saben cantar
Pero el Profesor, él sí sabe lo que está haciendo
Y él tiene música muy buena
Y nunca está bailando como esos pendejos
Que siempre están bailando por ahí
Y Sir Scratch and K-Cut
Ellos sí que saben DJ muy bueno
Tú sabes lo que estoy diciendo?

Now all you rap clowns let's go the seven rounds
And put down your imaginary frown
Or take it to the streets, with multiple beats
Get as loose as you want, flaunt, no beeps
This time when you rhyme it won't be for a rock show
It'll be on the block so
We can work like strainers, or filters
And find out all remainders and the best builders
Cause so many MC's get star struck
Get on stage and find out that they're washed up
Cause some new jack took em out
But they was sleepin so what's the surprised look about
It ain't hard to tell that your records sell
Because your rhymes smell and people scared
Of a brother that drop the bombshell
So to show and prove the fact it's, important that you
Come and show your tactics, ASAP, let's rap

Aquí estamos hablando ahora de los rappers
Que se están olvidando de la calle
Y que están tratando de cambiar sus canciónes
Y no saben lo que están haciendo
Pero que ya saben que Main Source
Ellos no son nuevos de dónde vienen
Y vienen de la calle y quieren hacer música para la calle
Entienden? OK

Okay

Terror on wax, Large Professor K-Cut and Sir Skratch
Kickin it to kids that can't latch
On, to the meaning of a real rap song
Just producing corn, I like to warn
We build it up dis far without sellin out
And still got clout
So you continue to sell and be a sap
And when you're ready to snapback I tell you
Let's rap

Sí, porque la gente se están olvidando
Y están tratando de cambiar la mente de ellos
Pero que así no era el objeto de antes
Que es diferente ahora, entienden?
Pero que la gente yo no me explico como son, OK?
Pues aquí estámos diciendo paz, y adiosWe all know Roger, Roger lives in Queens
Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, and he fiends
For knowledge, and people try to diss him because of that
Surrounded by the ghetto plus the fact that the brother's black
But Roger gets high -- grades on tests
He smokes -- brain cells to rest
But brothers jel on him because he has a goal
And gold awards hanging all off the brain pain
Behold, Roger doesn't fight, his brain is his left and his right
But if tainted, he just might
So all you brothers flying with a broken wing
Watch Roger do his thing

Roger graduated from high school
But didn't advance or enhance no scholarship, cool
Flip, he did not, he got a job at a parking lot
Teased because he wasn't making G's at a crack spot
He started meeting the people with the high ranks
Attained a job as a manager at a bank
Roger started rolling a Benz
Had a bunch of rich friends and that's where his ghetto life ends
He rolls around the projects he lived in once in a while
Sees the brothers that was jelling and cracks a smile
They have rings, but he has a ring of keys
And D's, and now my man Roger is worth G's
He doesn't have to rap or sing
He has to think, so watch Roger do his thing

Roger has diamonds like I have lyrics
Always in good spirits, and money's never made
"Its hip to be suqare" is Roger's main motto
Cash coming out of his ass like he hit lotto
He reminices on all the bad years
Remembers his fear and smiles ear to ear
Counts a knot and goes to ?Backa Jaluts? to eat
Hogo Boss on his feet smelling sweet
Gucci frames and all the high class names
Stetson suit clean on the scene laying down game
You can't cramp his style, he's as sharp as the tip of a nail file
You're going to fail, child
Check him out while he plays with his ring
Watch Roger do his thing

Roger's a Cassanova now, he's swimming in women
A symbol in sex messing with their intellects
Throws parties every week in his happy home
Out on the island and stays smiling alone
That's his style, macking skins and laying girls like towels
Not acting wild
Question: Roger's life seems complete, right?
That's what an education can and might do
It may sound corny but it's true
Roger does his thing and so can you
So get your head out the sling
And watch Roger do his thing, hit it

My man J.D. Drumsticks gets busy. Yo J.D., chillMain Source forever, crews got to get more clever
Whatever, just have your shit together
Cause it's '91, which means not a thing
Cause for centuries we'll make crews sing
No matter what record label, we stay stable
Pick up the album, we're never on cable
Crews cross over, but not Main Source
I use Simon's guitar strings to floss
Brand New Heavies play the shit that people
Used to listen to in '70 Chevies
So we don't have to loop up a beat to fuck your crew up
Just bring the band, by the way we got Jan
On the drums, Andrew plucks the bass with his thumbs
And Simon, like I mentioned before, just strums
The guitar strings for all my siblings
Just follow when everyone sings

Brand New Heavies (Brand New Heavies)
And Main Source   (Main Source)       (Repeat 4x)

Ayo, wait a minute
We got the Heavies in the crib putting the funk back in it
And if you know the Main Source, then you know my man K-Cut
And him and Simon is going to show you what's up

(K-Cut scratches)

I can't forget the other man on the scratches
Sir Scrathes, like his hands are two hachets
While Andrew plucks on the bass
I'm gonna let my man Sir Scratch drop taste

(Sir Scratch gets busy)

Ayo, now everybody sing

Brand New Heavies (Brand New Heavies)
And Main Source   (Main Source)       (Repeat 4x)

Just an example of how rappers don't have to sample
To keep the funk beat on the street
Slide to the side when the Source and the Heavies collide
Bonafied Funk for ya hide
To wiggle, making beatheads uncivil
Turntables swivel as the rap crews shrivel
Away, like a fiend with tooth decay
Peace is not the word to play, hey

Brand New Heavies (Brand New Heavies)
And Main Source   (Main Source)       (Repeat 4x)

One time it's the...

One time for your mind, one time for your mind
The Large Professor in the house, Main Source forever y'all, be coolI lamp on the corner selling bootleg tapes
Rappers collect breaks so that I make papes
I don't give a fuck about Kane or Biz
Finally, somebody beats The Wiz
And that somebody is me
Catch me around three, and I'll be busy as a motherfucking bee
Call five-0 and let 'em know
I'm selling bootlegged tapes, and they'll say... so?
My brothers in rap
Are gonna have to keep comin' up off the trap
Cause I'm a salesman on the street
You know what to do if you can't stand the heat - can't eat
Vacate the kitchen with your bitchin'
I specialize in reproducin' tapes over Wild Pitchin'
If stupid people buy 'em, I'll continue to supply 'em
For $4.99, you can't complain about the volume
Cause it's a bootlegged tape
And it's money I'ma make

Check it

I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'

Now I'ma tell ya something about yaselves

Now all you people claim you're all about loot
But when it comes to tapes, everyone takes the escape route
So I take advantage; and rappers sit and wonder how I manage
To do millions of dollars of damage
I'm hustlin' ya tapes out of crow[?]
And on my pole, sales go: brand new to gold
Instead of cryin' up an ocean
Record people need to hire brothers like me to do promotion
The ghetto entrepreneur, make Crazy Eddie feel like manure
Discontinue his store
And, yo, the president can't stop it
Cause I got mega-presidents before his ass in my pocket
Let the IRS ask for tax
I'll just make tracks, no haps; I can relax
And keep slinging tapes that are garbage
And like Goldilocks watch the people eat 'em like they were porridge
Cause it's a bootlegged tape
And it's money I'ma make

I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'

Cause it's a bootlegged tape
And it's money I'ma make

I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'
I'm busy bootleggin'[Mikey D: Intro]
A-yo word 'em up, on the real to real, man?
Niggas be on that old bullshit, straight up and down
You know what I'm saying?
Cos when I wasn't doing shit
Motherfuckers ain't have a thing to say to a nigga
Now they see I'm making a little loot
Doing a couple of shows here and there
Making wax, you know what I'm saying?
Motherfuckers wanna come out of the blue and be my man
You know what I'm saying?
You wasn't my friend before, why you wanna be my friend now?
I don't need no more friends, I got a million motherfucking friends
You know what I'm saying?
And all of my friends is real
But now I think I'm all of that and shit because I'm down with Main Source
That's the little rumour these motherfuckers are spreading
Cos I won't give 'em pound and all of that shit, man
Well, the shit is just bullshit, straight 'em up
You know what I'm saying?

[Mikey D: Verse 1]
And why should I give them a pound when before they was dissin'
Now they see I got position, and wanna join my mission
When I was broke they always spoke behind my back
Saying that my rap was wack and I was hooked on crack
Well nigga fuck that
Now that I'm back I'm on some other shit so fuck that old brother shit
Cos now I'm on some real undercover shit
You didn't want a pound before so why you wanna slap me five?
Said I was falling off and I was gonna take a dive

[Mikey D: Outro]
But I'm rocking shit, any motherfucking way
You know what I'm saying?
So fuck what you think, fuck what you heard, fuck how you feel
You know what I'm saying?
Cos I'm not dealing like that, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas need to get off that old bullshit
And that's my word, you know what I'm saying?
A-yo what's up Sha-Queen, you chilling, baby?

[Sha-Queen: Intro]
Nah, I ain't chilling Mike, you know what I'm saying?
I'm having massive problems, kid, you know what I'm saying?
My family's stressing me out
My man's getting on my nerves 24-7, yo
I can't take it no more, Mike
You know what I'm saying?
I thought I'd stick around and take it but I can't handle it
You know what I'm saying?
I think it's getting to that point right now
I think I gotta break out, you know what I'm saying?
Cos they keep stressing me

[Sha-Queen: Verse 2]
A-yo I'm ready to explode
Niggas got me to the point well now I'm fucking heated
Nothing nice to say your words well then you're best to leave it
Bitches getting jel cos I ain't fail and fucking left them hanging
But still I chill with my true crew, ain't nothing changing
I'm very down to earth and real
And anything I gotta say, yo I'mma say it, fuck how that person feel
Living my life the way I want to in my own way
Yeah, fuck what everybody else say

[Sha-Queen: Outro]
You know what I'm saying?
Cos I'm getting sick of that bullshit
You know what I'm saying?
I just graduated from High School
I ain't gotta go through that shit no more
You know what I'm saying?
Cos I'm a grown motherfucking woman
I just can't take it no more, I'm about to be out kid

[K-Cut: Intro]
Yo, but check this out though Sha
You know what I'm saying?
Every time I turn around niggas is trying to flip on me, man
From MCs to engineers to friends, you know what I'm saying?
That's some old bullshit, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, it's up to the point where
I'm just like yo fuck this, man, I want to be on my own
Word up, man, just do my own thing, man
Word up, and fuck everybody else
Word up, but yo check this out, man
I'm in a whole different world

[K-Cut: Verse 3]
Niggas is straight up fucking flaky
(Supposed to be your friends, hiding behind fake grins)
I know you bastards hate me
And plus you're waiting for the fall
But I can see you, pumping up the streets
Chilling with my peeps, making those platinum beats
Fixing your mouth to try to diss, yeah there's no need
I heard you're doing good
Plus your groups shift double wood
So your dissing is small talk and your beats are extinct
We're making platinum records, fuck what you think

[K-Cut: Outro]
You know what I'm saying, man?
Because after today, man, shit is just dead, man
You know what I'm saying?
I know who the real snakes are
You know what I'm saying?
So when you see K-Cut, man
Don't step to me like you knew me, man
Don't be my friend, man, because I know the real deal
You know what I'm saying Sha, LT, Sir Scratch, Mikey D?
Word up, man, I'm on some ghost shit, man
So just leave me alone, man, because I'm out, man
Leave me alone...

[Sir Scratch: Verse 4]
(You should smile)
Smile for what, my name ain't Howdy Doody
Or ??? so let some motherfuckers think I'm moody
So kid I trust shit, it's something I ain't with
I used to be nice, yeah, but now niggas are getting lit
So grab a hold of my pole when I stroll
Iceberg cold and 24 years old, bitch!
I got the feel cos I'm real with Mikey D and Kevin
So when you see me coming motherfuckers get to steppingIntro: Large Professor

Yo, I heard my man told his girl that he's going to jump off
The roof for her cause he love her. Now that is funny. That's
Funny. You know what I'm saying? I did not live 19 years to
Throw my life away for some girl that I just met last year. Yo
Fornt door, back door, I ain't doing it. Point blank. Let
Me do this, man, hold up

She took your bread, now you're annoyed
You should have kicked her out when she became unemployed
You didn't listen, stuck to ass-kissing
Now your money's missing, now your honey's missing
You used to buy her shoes, shirts, sweaters and all
She had your head like a medicine ball
You even tried to disrespect me when you slid
Right into her trap like the baseball kid
But I can tell by the way shit was looking
She'd eat up the food and jet like Bookman
You always said I didn't give you your props
You wound up getting shitted on, hops
Trust the man with the corrective lenses
Before you wind up ripping doors off the hinges
Mad as hell, with a bone-dry well
And you had the nerve to think that I was jel, but

It's a shame, when I gotta watch my man go down in the game (Repeat 4x)

Ayo kid, my man is trying to act like it's Easter and he's jumping
Out of his rabbit-ass mind, talking about he's flying off of roofs
Yo kid, I like girls and the whole thing, but it ain't going to roll
Like that. Yo kid, let me explain this, hold up, hold up

You're sitting in a cell, mad as hell
Because you've decided to kill for your madamoiselle
I got some bad news, she's in the world getting used
And you can't even act confused
Cause after I hipped your ass to the script
You should've just played it to the back like a pip
I knew she was dreaded, but you wanted to set it
And act as though I was the one with the unleaded
I saw where you was headed
I just couldn't sweat it, fuck it, now you'll regret it
When you gotta lock ass for a pack of ?Barlils?
I hope that'll sharpen up your listening skills
Cause I can't keep giving brothers that sleep
My advice and they keep winding up in the heat
So no matter how much you think you love her
Before she was your girl I was your motherfucking brother, out

You know what I'm saying? I'll flip more than the script, kid
I said I'm looking at the front door, all that's fine and cool
But yo, I ain't being no fool. Point blank

And you know what we talking about (Repeat 4x)(Peace!)
Piece of what?
You can't mean P-E-A-C-E
Cause I've seen people on the streets
Shoot the next man and turn around and say peace
But that's leaving people in pieces
It's not what the meaning of peace is
To me it means absence of all confusion
Not the oozing and bruising
That we're all so accustomed to
Your friend got beef? I'll bust him too
What a brother from a certain way of life explained to me once, dunce
He didn't realize the fact that
He and myself were brothers on the same boat
Now last month he got hemmed up, huh, that's all she wrote
So I pick it up where she left the exclamation
Looking for an explanation
Little kids think that peace is a word that you use to sound down
And I frown
Cause that's what I was told at eight years old
And now I'm trying to break the mold
So stop the dominoes
Because I think it's about time that everyone knows

The incorrect usage of the word "peace" has got to cease
Stop fronting (Stop fronting)
Stop fronting, like you know what I'm saying
And on that note, I'll leave you with this
