[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah, Golf Wang[Intro: Hodgy]
I fucked this flow

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
This is my electronic press kit, I hot as some fresh shit
Nigga recollect bitch, grow grey hairs, don't stress it
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
She lets me in, I sex her then she sexier than my leather vans
Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your courtesy
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitches shit in my drawers like you piss in my drawers
Nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drums for when the champ come, bitch

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creeping in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowling, hunger at its fucking best
I'm a beast like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse our swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual
Wolf Gang, point me to a nigga I should prove it to
Under pressure, we just stand in the middle like hula hoops

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
The fortress is fortified (bitch)
Money in my pockets like I'm 45, Hodgy Beats recording live
Bitch I be surely high and I don't need wings to fly
I'm the air with the pigs, Left Brain, Domo Genesis

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Knock-knock, who's there? It's me
Your girlfriend had a really nice meeting with my dick (What?)
I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar)
Nigga don't believe me, kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebie jeebies?
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
(5 albums, 100 songs, and you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
I bet you got some J-Kwon, you ain't got no fuckin Yeezy?)
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, "Where my dick go?"
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her whole
Enchilada, I gotta lotta that 'Preme and I'm paying nada
It seems that I'm product placement but I'm not I'm just fuckin' awesome
Yo mama look like a ugly (Fuck you) loser[Intro: Tyler]
Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen Degeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley oop
The Golf Wang hooligans, is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

[Hook]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

[Tyler]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique
Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch

[Outro]
And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box, Wolf Gang[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Papa ain't call even though he saw
Me on TV, it's all good (Fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw
Swallow girl, it's just nut
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
(Hodgy, pass me my inhaler)
I'm sicking of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?"
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch

[Hook]
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt
Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch
Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up
So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, Who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new desert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she walk around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...
I think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like tape that's super glued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit

[Domo Genesis]
C'mon, my nigga. You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as.. F your butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro. Here come this weak-ass nigga, Samuel[Verse 1]
Got all the black bitches mad cause my main bitch vanilla
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome I always X them
Like Wolverine stepson attacking a deadly weapon
I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass..
Yo, I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three bear house eating their mothafuckin' porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy special effect the wet bitches be banging
And please never disrespect my set
With Canons hanging from our necks like it's a mothafuckin' circus

[Hook]
You little niggas better check my French
You getting money? Better check my French
What time is it, huh? Check my French
If you got my shit you better check my French
I'm making moves, check my French
I speak English but check my French
Your ho be on my penis, she check my French, bitch

[Verse 2]
I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard, cause every girl I'm digging
When I'm digging in her pussy, I'm never using a rubber
But fuck it, I guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it dripping green and red like double cheese buggers
Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp, yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that's silly ho
The most that they can do is find me, I'm hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
Oh no, Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all stars and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in their music and create the face
Of the picture punchline figured out, ahh I get you
No you don't nigga so why don't you go and figure
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type of dude that choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo you better than us?
Digest what I'm saying? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
The Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink hoes
We think sorta odd so we think so

[Outro]
Crusing in my go kart at Walmart selling cupcakes
Go ahead admit it faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape
That involve ballpark franks and silver duct tape
Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco you're probably drinking Cuervo
With some vatos with the door closed watching Zorro, you homos[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 2: Frank]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler]
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here’s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building

[Gunshots][Hook]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'mma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my freedmind, cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyler]
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine

[Bridge]
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)

[Outro]
Grab a drink, look in the sky, we never have to leave
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep[Produced by Left Brain]

[Intro]
7
Nigga, it's MellowHype, what, you forgot?
Yeah, Left Brain on the beat

[Hook]
Got a bitch for everyday of the week
Not to mention the runner ups, told them no mentioning me
It go 7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
Monday through Sunday, someone new sleeping with me
Long as she keep going strong, make sure I sleep comfortably
It go 7,6,5,4,3,2,1, 7,6,5,4,3

[Verse 1]
She rolling marijuana and she let it all
It's only Wednesday, that's humpday, we finna' get it on
I like them white body woman, think she a little toned
Camera shoot, don't like cameras, mount it and film at home
So many people be calling ya boy, HB just stalling (Oh girl!)
Wake up after sleep to birds and tweet she still all on ya boy
Open my eyes to a pair of tits, bacon and some grits
Got my Thursday coming soon and oh she with the shit
No effort to get it wetter, she hit the split, she hit the splits
I walk around here free balling, play for the Knicks, she give me kiss
Gloss wearing off to the max, our lips, they stick together
Speaking tounge until it splits, until it splits
That weed, I twist like my nose rings, as she's rubbing my plugs
This Tempur-Pedic's the sweetest, she's white as a dove
Baby believe it, you're eager to be here, just say you're in love
Hate be the meat to the cleaver, Jesus she’s about to pull up, Friday

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can't control a man, can't force him to hold ya hand
She get deep and then we snap like rubber bands, a hunnid bands
Parades of shades and underhands, the storm is now is thundering
You start stuttering, mumbling
Hurry up and buy, thanks, come again
You purchased enough time here, arguing with the cashier
Can't you see that there's a line here, selfish ass
You ain't the only fish in sea with ya' shell fish ass
And I'm selling 'em by the seashore
Where our resigns take a detour
You always mad at something, fuck you gotta be mad at me for?
All the things that I do, this shit just keep me prideful
Shit, now the world should be your rival
I'm the nigga standing right beside you
And everything is temporary, especially in February
Valentine and chocolate cherries, I'm copping 'em voluntarily
I keep my gang tight, rolling downhill, all news bearing
Pick her up and drop her off, but with them heels and gold earrings
I found this bitch, first she was lost
Look at her now, nigga I ain't sharing

[Interlude]

[Hook][Verse 1: Hodgy]
I got a one track mind
On this runaway train
And your runaway dime
Give me that runaway brain
I'm a baller and a player and she's all about the game
And I come to entertain
And she come after I came
Her name is Tatyana, or her name must be Christina
But when she get in to begging I tell her by like felicia
I think her name is McLaron, but she sure ain't CRV
That's the type of chick I see around but do hardly
Bitch, I'm up and I'm running as soon as you start me
Fresher than Chewbacca Shakka
White, tall, starched tee
My wolves bark like trees
Talk like G's
Nigga talk like me
I'm just rapping on the beat
Consider that I'm an artist
I'm there looking like the labels and bitches, I go the hardest
They're aiming at my wolves
Like they finna go to target
And you ain't gonna buy shit
I ain't surprised

[Hook x2]
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
If you got a fucking problem come and get you some
And bring yo pistol gun
Me and my fucking pack of wolves hollerin

[Verse 2]
I wanted to kick a flow but I decided to right a speech
That's my word
You're getting to me but I ain't in your reach
You sit and gossip like a ho
And you know what hoes preach
These niggas go to church and in the front row sleepin
Roman ain't shit and his homie got a kid
Roman wants to be a chef and his homie planned to be a pig
Poppin pills with bitches
Plan to rehearse gigs
But you niggas don't phase me you must be crazy
I say what I want it ain't a but or a maybe and
Yeah she bad in her fucking C Class 80
Just like the next girl
"What's up baby?"
You want to fuck? You'll lay me but you can't replace me
Get inside her little heart and then she can't erase me
Amazing, amazing but her butt cake tasting
Appetizing antagonized with that categorizer
Sex with her and massages
I chop her up in garages

[Hook X2][Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It's all me, I'mma kill 'em no problem
110 degrees, watch me sizzle don't bother
Please, Bet you give up to me
Cause, anything left to compete, get cold slaughter
Puffin' the best pot
Fucked in the head lock
Thumb in yo Ex Box, She suck it like Xpac
Son is the next Pac
Naw nigga, I'm the new me
A lot of niggas talking, but that shit don't really move me
Ready or not, I'm in your spot like the Fugees
Shit is real bitch, not that shit you see in the movie
I rumble for the money if I'm willing and able
I rap like I see my last meal on the table
I'm back on my grizzy, wings spread like an angel
Ain't Safe tho, I got a couple cracks in my halo
Pack loud, call that muthafucka Master Chief
Down for my muthafuckas like Master P
If you're looking for the revolution, ask for me
Pass the tree, and watch me Hulk smash the beat
Ask for beef, don't end up as a causality
You rappers weak
You see me, better ask for peace
Couple hundred Wolf niggas that will thrash for me
Now the whole world wanna smoke hash with me
Said bitch, I'm A God, no blasphemy
Now the whole world wanna smoke hash with me

[Bridge: Hodgy Beats]
Blow one in the air
In the air
Blow one in the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Bitch ass niggas don't be smoking, nigga
We be smoking hella blunts over here, nigga
OF, Trash Wang, turn up
Fuck everybody nigga
Imma buy everybody from OF AK-47s
Watch us, nigga
(pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
I don't fuck with niggas too fast to speak
All you muthafuckas too fashion week
I be working hard like an athlete
Cry a nigga a flooded river down the saddest creek
Oh, you mad it's me?
You should be glad it's me
Shit, I'm a fucking MC
Your fucking raps are weak
And if you suckas tempt me, I'm pointing out pipsqueaks
Knocking on your fucking door for beats like Memph Bleek
Dear Summer, Dear Summer, I know its hard
And I ain't working in the office
My nigga, my life is awesome
Constantly facing depression since childhood
Life was also surrounded by my morals
My nigga, this karma's corny
And my peoples doing great
And the outcome is greater
Since you niggas talking God
Ain't nobody gonna save ya
I'm your muthafucking savior
Renegade angel like I'm Xavier
Blow one in the air
(I spit in yo face)[Verse 1]
I'm never alone; it's me, myself and this misery
Darkness despite the 5/8 glitteries
Plug me in like I'm the new Kinect (360-Xbox)
Yeah, plug me in like I'm the new connect, slanging crack rock
Under the influence, underrated, my booth a sweatshop
Hang towels and tank tops on my Sony C800
Doctor tell me to quit, enzymes rising in my liver
But that's where me and him differ, nigger, I am not a quitter
Half the time, mind's in the shitter, I'm in the clouds, I hear the scriptures
Most of us don't love to be givers, pretty swell listeners, providing for those relying
You can't define who you are, give fine line print refinement
Motives for better timing, my motive's forever rhyming
I open the forum for them, they're waiting for me to chime in
And say what I said, Simon
I'm debating if I should sign in

[Verse 2]
I'm never alone; it's me, myself, and my son
I'm up before the sun for my son, that's my number one priority
Majority of people are minority; underhanded, I understand it
Being taken advantage of ain't the best feeling, is it?
The actions are found through anger, named it concealed imprisonment
I'm trying to implement the simple shit, not hoping for episodes of incidents
Which is prevalent without a settlement
I'm heaven-sent, hell bound, fresher than luxury with lemon scent
And peppermints, leather, tints, rev the 6 Series
Beep the horn and see if she can hear a bitch clearly
Make a bamboo earring, got her name in cursive in the center
A self-centered woman with no room for you to enter on her vagina's agenda
Got my name embedded, permanent henna
I'll forget the times we had, will find another to resemble her


[Bridge]
There's always that somebody
Could you possibly be that somebody, that's-uhh
Watching, learning, scheming, turning tables
There's always somebody, there's always that
Could possibly be that somebody, behind your back
Watching, learning, scheming, turning tables

[Outro]
Y'knamsayin?
Nowadays you just gotta watch your back, baby
I mean, you gotta watch your back like you got two backs
You feel me? Can't be trusting these motherfuckers
They all scheming, man. All they want is your motherfucking paper, your motherfucking talent, whatever you got, man
Don't give up your independence, nigga
And your motherfucking mind and that's all you got, y'nahmean?
Besides your word[Intro]
You know at, at times I wanna be real, real positive
When I feel real negative, you know
I just wanna be on the grind
I am on the grind, what the fuck you doing

[Verse 1]
Is it difficult to ship a boat
Is a ship a boat
Bringing in shipments
Odd Future equipment
Check my statistics
Wipe off your lipstick
Lips around this dick
Money make all the hoes swallow
And money move the crowd and make the crowd follow
Money translates from English to Tagalog
Strutting life's runway you coked up model
Niggas like flossing until they floss you
Busy eating got you feeding burrito with salsa
The problem that I have with me is me
Where I go I'm being watched like channel Disney
Boomerang motive of a frisbee
Once he's going he's not coming back is he, nah

[Verse 2]
I get to the point, absolutely pissed
Cut you off like a hand, absolutely missed
Can't shake it, the pain can't fake it
Life and love is like food, you eat it how you make it
Sound like I'm saying the same shit you don't understand
Love in my right feet and you the other hand
My cap snaps back like black rubberbands
The fact that I'm black and I rap brother man
Put me above the ladder, steppin' on bladders
Fuck family matters
I'm a bad black caffer
Plus I'm a bastard, where's my male figure
I might as well look up to the white male pale nigga
Grape to the wine-side
Eyes to my blindside
No emotions, my feelings are dime-wide
I'm on some new shit, some true shit
While others play Brittany Murphy in Clueless[Hook]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby сould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit it's going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

[Verse 1: Hodgy]
I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summer time, I'mma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us Venice beachin', she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my freedmind, cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyler]
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine

[Bridge]
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)

[Outro]
Grab a drink, look in the sky, we never have to leave
We're here, all night, school is in session
Look, you know, the water's pretty deep, let's go to sleep[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I am sinful sentiment
Criminal Demon sent
The fuck your rumor lifestyle
What is your profile?
Bet it ain't zero to one eighty in two point five
I'm in a five point five
With my three five seven
Five bitches in the back listen to my voice like reverend
I drop them off in a parking lot
They run to their civic chevron
More meddling to the peddling
Going home to her hesband (hesband? FUCK YOUR HUSBAND BITCH)
Nigga I break your Mac-zilla to the max-i-mum
Blondy va-cuums cum, sucks like drac-u-la
Dirt De vil Cruella, white chocolate vanilla
Polka dotted spotted wallet interior croc-a-della
I'm cultivated face it smiles motivated braces
Start with your clothes and make up
Lashes rings and bracelets
Our strippers so naked
American Apparel spandex
Blows like a air conditioner
I'll make her a fan next
O.F. shows six tickets to row six
She catch six I throw six
She stretch dicks aerobics a blow fish
I know this, this ho-bitch
I sold tits to old rich motherfucks who she gold-digs (GIMME THAT GOLD!)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guns n Roses! Fucking Posers!
Nigga keep spittin' that snotty noses
Keep preaching that hocus pocus
I keep three sixes cause the shit is bogus
Boloney, malarkey, hutch and starsky
Shit is gettin' fishy wit' a box of sardines
Now I gotta eat them like shark and the shit is
Getting harder than a concretes dick
O.F. Sergent
Cleaner than a virgin tryin' to fuck de-tar-gent
Thats a bargain
Wolf gang wolf gang cats is barking
Try calling the bounce
Nigga guns is sparking!
Light is darkened end is starting
The car of giving a fuck is parking
Feel that heart beat n' get that car key
And drive the motherfucker into that anarchy!!
Start that car
Drive to nowhere and nowhere's far
And when you get there say hi to the dead kids walking
GO!

[Outro]
Hodgy: Tyler nigga you driving kinda fast nigga
Tyler: I know *laughs*
Hodgy: Yo, I dare you to drive a little faster
Tyler: *laughs*
Hodgy: I dare you to drive a little faster
Tyler: Ima do it
Hodgy: O shit! Ey man look at that anarchy
Tyler: Where
Hodgy: Nigga I dare you to fucking drive into that shit. I fucking dare you!
Tyler: hmmmm
Hodgy: Nigga you not gonna do it. I FUCKING DARE YOU!!!
*car drives and turns around*
Tyler: uhhh *laughs*
*car parks*
Tyler: ummm alright GO!!
*car takes off*Mike Ozo

[Verse 1]
She is going down that crack rock road
Let go of the steering wheel grab the matchbox slow
Take a dose of what most of us call that robot nose
Give you shit until I dip it like a pothole
When I'm glancing you looking at me, seeing I got gold
I put my foot down, baby girl I got soul
And so what if I'm a non-believer?
With the life beyond your boundaries
You step in, I could make your heaven hell
And use it as a weapon well
Empty shells, jail, no bail
Maybe parole, when I roll
You will go out the load 'til I explode, C4 boom
The only one who blows my head like ballons
Can't wait til my baby out of that cocoon of yours
He will bloom, of course
And consume the source that we giving, it's a given
It's a given when I look up in the sky
I don't see a fucking ribbon
That's on top of what contains your intelligence
You're my relevance, your my angel, I haven't seen Heaven since
They say that red is the color of the Devil's dress
Finding the bitch, she a fully-dressed dish

[Outro]
Damn, ayo I just.. you know, I.. you know how I feel, right? I mean
I don't really have to elaborate anymore, it's just like, in your face..[Intro]
H, B, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Our letters divide as we differ, differ like a high over liquor
Shot glass or bong, which one hit me quicker?
You made me turn before, you should hit the flicker
Unless you want a bumper car fender bender
I know I'm guilty but I'm not from the surrender gender
I was introduced to the world in November - send a
Rose in the mail love written on the petals
Picked out the concrete, in the middle of the ghetto
She make me rage (rage) like I'm listenin' to techno
Had no insurance cause I paid for the gecko
My past made my future, the reason no regretful
But not for her, she the one that made me special
I'm from the bottom, shorty from the middle middle class
Was a pot of gold, had me on the Skittle task
If she want something, she don't forget to ask
Because I put her first, all the other bitches last (yeah)

[Hook]
Girls on my left (left) girls on my right (right)
But there's only one that's spendin' the night
And it's you (it's you) it's you (it's you)
It's you (it's you) it's you (it's you)
Girls on my left (left) girls on my right (right)
But there's only one that's spendin' the night
And it's you (it's you) it's you (it's you)
It's you - GIRL, it's you

[Verse 2]
I can say that I met you on accident, it's the truth B
Caught a stutter in my tone when she introduced me
Your shirt tight, purse white, Gucci
I'm her type, shirt white, sag pants loosely
She got my duck (duck) duck goose see
Out in the pu-blic, girl I'm actin goofy
Popcorn and chips, go with the movie
Kiss you while we in the store, I don't care who sees
Three A's, two B's, two C's
C's stand for credit, and I get extra
She give me more of what the haters get less of
I hop off the tour bus and never a next-up
She stay in the (Lab) with me like (Dexter)
Drive me around, cause she sweet like nectar
I'm complimentin' you, girl it's not a lecture
I'm happy you let the Boogeyman get'cha

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Don't rush it, it's early, there's crust in your eyes
But surely, I notice, the lust in your eyes
Girlie, I know you had enough of the guys
Start with HB, don't be trustin the lies

[Verse 3]
Do you wanna spend the night? (The night?)
Do you wanna spend the night? (Huh?) And fall in love
Do you wanna spend the night? (The night?)
Do you wanna spend the night? (Night?) And fall in love
Do you wanna spend the night?
Maybe you can even be my wife - just for tonight
Do you wanna spend the night?
Girl you can spend the night, tonight

[Hook]

[Interlude][Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Life after death, death after life
Made mistakes before, I swear I wasn't gonna do it twice
You love me and it wouldn't change
So I'm by myself which will remain the same
And it was just one girl who left me sprung
And it was just one girl who had me going dumb
And it was just one girl who was where I was from
Gave me her feelings and I left that bitch with none

[Verse 2: Tyler the Creator]
I was in love, but I jumped out quick
Gave her my heart, she broke it, put it in the bucket
On another level I'm bitter, I wanted to keep her
But now this shit is coming out your speaker
Wish that you could meet her
But she's chopped up in my freezer
By the mixed vegetables, I'll eat her
Looking in the iris, I knew she was lying
Cuz she wasn't crying, laughing
So I starting grabbing
And she started gasping for air
She told me the truth, I didn't care
The dead made me win
And her death made me grin
Like a mouth with a side of nipples and limbs
This the end, yeah
Potatoes and grits on the plate of her
I should have stayed away from her
But she cheated
And now she's in my freezer bleeding
Her parents looking for her, good luck
You dirty bitch

[Verse 3: Tyler the Creator]
Met the bitch, tied the bitch up
And then I ate her up because she want to go and fuck my cousin up
Nigga's balls in the room and now this bitch is mad at me cause I made a song with autotune with my nigga G
She looking at me all mad and all sad
But now I'm glad that she's wrapped up in that Glad bag
And that shit's all black and I'm wearing all black
And now she mad cause I found out she was fucking, sucking other niggas
Busting, cumming, running, here I'm coming with a motherfucking knife and now I'm gunning
And now this bitch is screaming for help, yelp, dealt, the motherfucking card that she dealt
But that's her fucking fault, I don't give a fuck
I fucking more, she fucking one and now these cases that I caught
Shit, but I ain't even fucking tripping
I need a new chick, I'm sick of dealing with these bitches

[Outro]
In the club, niggas in the club[Verse 1]
Just another day in the life, Hodgy Beats
I am sickly prickly, apparent through pairs of crews
Down your avenue
I got a pair to shoot, they fall without their parachute
I knock him out his pair of shoes
Truth is a win, I dare to lose
You niggas are (barely true/very cute/barbecue?)
Remember when I was broke and I didn't have shit?
I had that EBT, I get that money and I flip
Those days were shades of blue, a nigga was so sick
And now I'm on the come-up but shit don't come up quick
Rubble young man run but I be in trouble with my fists
Breakin' jaw and take ya bitch
She passenger in my whip
She tatted across her tits, like me, "Mellowhype"
But the hype is so mellow, and tonight we go rebel
I'm way ahead of ya sunshine, I'm night time
Midnight in this right mind, where the daylight never shines
I'm in particular the extra curriculum
Rolling up that sticky dum, ain't stop till I'm feelin' numb

[HOOK]
I'm on a hiatus, man I'm one with the clouds
I'm on a hiatus, man I'm one with the clouds
I wave hi to the haters cause none of them are allowed

[Verse 2]
In the VIP with a sack of weed, my peeps chilling
Stupid Broads and superstars, no ordinary civilians
Trying to live to see a million, rapping's serial killin'
In my ('Vo or Mode)

[Outro]Uh, I got a cavity, I ate some bad candy
I need to go to the dentist, as sooon as possible
Syd the Kid, Hodgy Beats

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
If love is so sure, why am I unsure?
And If love is so pure, why are we unpure?
You went and disappeared so what did you come for?
Sweepin' up my broken heart, love is some chore
I fight for my rights like a Michael Moore
Gleemin' watch on your wrist, I bought from Michael Kor
We in the ring, 1 on 1, I can't fight no more
A disguise is on a oust until it hits your core
My house ain't a home, so we split the door
With my feet to the ceiling, hands on the floor
Upside down, downside up harassin' me
Close the vessels door cause it reach full capacity
Love cavity, is what it seems to be, actually
She passin' me up, while I'm in a stand still
I was full of myself until the cans spill
I was full of myself until the cans spill

Fuck you bitch, you stupid ass slut
You skill slik little.. ha ha
Yousa bitch
I fucking hate you, I hope you die
And after I kill you, I hope you die
And after I fucking kill you, I hope you die
BITCH, I hope you fucking die, ah!

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Fuck you and what you're goin through
I don't care about who you call, and what he goin' do
You can't fuck me up more, I've been in this shit hole
My pride never gets low, like aimin' a pistol
Fuck you bitch, in every single kind of way
The next we fuckin' ho, I'm goin out the condom way
Anaconda, I forgot bout what I was tryna to say
You sexy but you turn me off, like I'm kinda gay!
Fuck a female, a bitch is a relationship
Years is a waste of my time, cause I hate this bitch
You always wanna push me to my limits
I see you on that outs bitch, cause I don't wanna be in it
I'm finish, and I swear I would never come back
I don't chase love, bitch I run laps!
This isn't a race to see who marries you
Cause what we had is gonna be fuckin' gone in burials

Bad candy!
Bad Candy[Verse 1]
Now as time moves on and my clout gets bigger
How manny bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Iphone full of missed calls from this sick broad
Only fucked once, she complaining how she miss dog
Bitch chill there ain't nobody tripping over here
Appeared to have feelings watch me make them feelings disappear
Yeah, the magicians here, just kicking it
I'm sick with this pimping shit playing hoes ridiculous
I ain't got love for them only 'bout the grind
It's hunger on my heart and desire on my line
These other smoke behind, must beating through the fast lane
She pipe blowing no rice throwing keep your last name
I let you hit the weed, what else could you really need
You high and delirious telling me, you can't breathe
When you're without me, you don't know how you should be
That's the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese

[Hook]
Thats the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese
And bitches under my sleeve, yup, tryna smoke my weed up
Reefer, that's what I'm talking 'bout
Sativa, Indica, you need to listen to me
Little girl, you acting so basic (Bitch)
I'm tired of your payless ass
You need to cop some Asics, you basic (Bitch)
You need a mothafuckin' facelift, I like 'em classic, dinosaur Jurassic

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Same old, same old, bitch you's a lame old
You're not the pot of gold to be at the end of a rainbow
It's Ludacris abusiveness, I ain't got time
I'm busy on my music shit, is Nike tryna do this shit?
Hodgy back to prove this shit and watch the bank approve the snitch
With big checks in 'em, recognize a pro, he bring the vets with 'em
Respect the vibe of hoes countering long neck syndrome
Average is basic, day five well day six
Different day, same shit, my high speaks my language
Articular terminology, follow me or swallow me
Shallow me, blow these basics off
Like kush Cali weed, basic meaning basic salary
Face lift over exceeding calories, instead of weight watchers
She getting donuts from Valerie's, colors flux from mood rings
Now she ain't happy, the hood rat come out
And the weave gets nappy, Hodgy leaving this ratch

[Hook][Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
What the hell?!

[Hodgy Beats - Verse 1]
Yeah... yeah, uhh
Ride 7:30, arrive 7:30
Ride hella dirty, shades extra nerdy
I heard it from a birdie, Blackberry I replied
In the burb you heard me barter cash and get supplied
I cut off their supplies, cause this a drug movement
Crack music muh'fucker this is thug music
I hustle harder because this how the thugs do it
I move smart decisions, you just STUCK stupid!
Ace fuckin' moved it, Vyron oddly looped it
Fall in love with music like you struck by Cupid
My hair is in your face nigga three pounds to it
If the radio don't play my jam, they fuckin' foolish
What's his name? (Hodgy Beats) He's the coolest
The paper and the pen that's what he'll take you to school with
Odd Future is his camp, tree strumps with a branch
Where they lamp, and they chant, and they grant, when they ranked
You with this certified stamp of the procedure
Sick-ass music, now you niggas got fevers...
Sick-ass music, now you niggas got fevers

[Hook: repeat x2]
I do it for the Pasadena skaters, Pasadena lovers
Pasadena haters, Pasadena mothers
I do it for the Pasadena waittress, Pasadena music
It's a Odd Future playlist, it's a Odd Future playlist

[Hodgy Beats - Verse 2]
One verse is all you need for a fix
Cause I'm not throwing stones and sticks, I'm lodgin bricks
I'm not a kid, but I can show you some (Trix)
That'll have you in the mix like Twix, switch!
I swear I hear 'em cheerin', I swear I know you hear 'em
Oops I did it again nigga fuck your Brittney Spear'n
I'm lookin' in the mirror, and my vision's gettin clearer
I can smell the truth gettin nearer
Reeboks black bag, Odd Future era
Iller than cold beans spilled upon your fresh new fit
We bangin' in your ears with some fresh new shit
I'm a (Jive) ass nigga with my (Fresh) music...[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Bitch
It's the five-nine taper fade; Sideline Laker game
High time save a page; They already know the name
Doms in this bitch I mean it's real shit taking place
Money still the motive and I'm clocking it like Flava Flav

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Let me take my scarf off five-four-three-two-one bitch
Hodgy bout to barf logs, I be spitting fire campin makin s'mores
My flow be tramping like you whores I'm suicidal fuck the door
I'm and if but and or

[Verse 3: Domo]
Bitch what the fuck is you talking bout if you ain't getting no money huh
Broke niggas is talking loud I swear you niggas is funny bruh
We what the fuck is up 2012 clutch as fuck
Fast lifestyle nigga slow me down double cup

[Verse 4: Hodgy]
Old school visans rhyme ambidextrous
I switch hands five o clock when your bitch lands by six
She will be quicksand better than the next nigga: this man
Pockets swell up like a sick gland killing your whole ambition
Bitch

[Verse 5: Domo]
My hat says high cause that's exactly how I feel bitch
All I need is green grass and gold on my real bitch
Watch me get it nigga I'mma sell it real quick
Hodgy drew the master plan and Domo hit the kill switch

[Verse 6: Hodgy]
I'm young fellow guy peddle by reppin MellowHigh
Girlfriend never settles why? To busy in the meadows high
Out to Dena I'm fresh like I'm out the cleaners
Hardwood like an angry beaver I'm nuts like my fucking t-shirt
Get it?

[Verse 7: Domo]
A phantom you never hand a random rapper eating cannibal
She can't refuse so I let her drink it like it's Danimals
Handsome dude she wanna be with standing by camera crews
I let her snooze and dream cause none of them wishes tangible

[Verse 8: Hodgy]
I'm balling like Benjamin it's all about the Benjamins
That's why people acknowledge me and I ain't even friends with them
Call a ho then stall a ho I'm also dope across the rope
Catch my fade I bang grenades and beat your face 'til it's off your throat

[Verse 9: Domo]
Please shut the fuck up let me put this shit to sleep
The shit he speak got him all antsy like his Christmas week
Silly me, riding with several bitches with slim physiques
And I'm tryna see lights cameras action like Mr. Cheeks

[Verse 10: Hodgy]
Army fatigue Bape boxes for the league
No ghetto barrettes and weaves down to the sleeve for the fees
If packaged she'll be petite know how to roll up my weed
Her doing's doing the deed and she don't really need shit

[Verse 11: Domo]
They asking Domo "where you been?" They feel they got ditched
Just look for the influence I be under that bitch and
It's a headlock when it come to that grip
You ain't never met a motherfucker done in that sick

[Verse 12: Hodgy]
I'm the best thing yet the I'm the best thing next
I bet I'll mess with presets and jet around all these vets
That don't know how to let go; this game is filled with a bunch of grey hair dead souls
Promise 90 retro, ho

[Verse 13: Domo]
Hey y'all get out of he way cause I'm going AWOL
Bitch lay off the gas that they giving your head tank dog
Thinking that you better than me will get you taked off
You either gotta win or go home, bitch it's the playoffs

[Verse 14: Hodgy]
More luxurious that a throwback with no low Jack no driver but it got doormats
Zero to sixty in like 4 flat; you know any nigga that own that
I ain't stuntin' I'm a youngin' me and my niggas we be thuggin'
At our shows that we be bugging groupie loving and we buzzing

[Outro: Both]

[Domo]
So meet me in the trap; it's going down
MellowHigh leaning like the jaw of Bobby Brown

[Hodgy]
Cops arrest me for a DUI prohibition
We don't need you motherfuckers to stop and listen
Golf Wang Bitch[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]

[Intro]
Just another day in the life (Hodgy Beats)
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
It's crazy when you have a vision isn't it?
Chef Boyar nigga
Back up in the kitchen with it
Like what a witted fitted
Oh why you actin' timid
These are with lots of lemon or a regal box of tinted
I hold the grahams I'm not talkin' bout the cracker
Ask my grams when you smoke one it'll relax ya
Mary Jane a muscle relaxer
Had enough of these bastards
Blow a half worth like man my calf hurt
You smokin' bad dirt
Where all that stress come from?
Son you look mad worse
Weed will get it off your shoulders
Pin and pad works
Wearin' a fucked up move
Like a plaid skirt
I got this kid up is gave cash a cash shirt
Before I left asked her about the organic OG mask dirt
She was so high my question slipped right passed her
The moral of my story is these good greens
I smoke myself to sleep and have a good dream (dream, dream)

[Hook: Hodgy Beats]
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta weed to smoke
Gotta lot-ta gotta lot-ta
Yeah, oh oh oh
Gotta lot-ta, weed to smoke (to smoke, smoke, smoke, Wolf Gang, smoke)
Smoke, ha ha
Smoke

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I got them grams
I got that hash
I got the keef
It's all up in my bowl
I'm ready to roll (weed) up
And then we gonna' smoke
Nigga we chillin'
Nigga we chillin'
We ain't trippin' on ya'll bitch ass niggas
Fuck ya'll niggas
Suck my dick up
Wolf Gang bitch
Where the fuck my weed at?
Hodgy Beats
Thelonious Martin collaboration
I don't really fuck with many producers and shit
Because ya'll mother fuckers just want a tight mother fucker to get on ya'll mother fuckin' track
And you know
You just want it to be hot
But this mother fucker works hard right here feel me
2012
Wolf Gang
Bitch[Intro]
Yeah, it's not my fault this time
I'mma blame it on (You)
This song im making is especially for (You)

[Verse]
Yeah, you make me feel like I'm trash
Like I'm im failing and staying in the back of the class
I thought school was wack being cool was wack
And niggas thought I was cool, how cool is that?
I want you to feel my pain cause I'm out in the rain
But without pain I wasn't gon' gain
My hearts not broken it's more of a sprain
My life ain't a dance like I'm on soul train
My world turned black, inverted cocaine
I can not explain, hopping on the next plane
6:45 in a 745
Seven shorties live and they ready for the ride
We live to survive or we living to die
Smoke 'til we high, we lose then we gone fly
Get up like cheddar and get it together
Get it now or never so you can hold it forever

[Hook]
My Odd Future
I gotta get it right now, I gotta get it right now
My Odd Future
I gotta right these lyrics down, I gotta use this paper right now
My Odd Future
I gotta get it right now, I gotta use this paper right now
My Odd Future
I gotta write these lyrics down, spit it, how this shit sound?{Verse 1: Hodgy}
Nigga I'm contagious
Ain't nobody cure us
One squirrel out of many gathering more nuts
Groupie fillies getting run over by the tour bus
Double salad sticky icky like suryp up
Me and my drink
Homie what's in your cup?
A-a-a-a-a-alcohol
A couple sacks, extra fat I bag them all
Swisher packs for the sacks I packed them off
We fly nigga we don't relax at all
I'm on my genuine: So anxious
Cruising round, drunk, like she know we're the takers
I can see through the make-up if she trying to fake us
Bring me to the bank but I never go bankrupt
Got my change up though I'll never change up
I go after my money like a fucking predator
I wake up to the sound of my lovely cash register

{Chorus: Hodgy}
Every time I see one of them chicken heads, I be like get off me
(Get off me, get off me)
Every time I see them girls in the red, I be like get off me
(Get off me. get off me)
Every time I see them chicken heads, I like, man, get off me
(Get off me!)
'Cos you're killing me hard
You're not killing me sotly[Chorus: Lee Spielman]
Cardboard crutches
Support the weight of the world
Ashes to ashes
Blossom and burn

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
Eany, meany miney, moe, you got a fucking problem?
Ashes for blossoms, thrashing and problems
Golf trash possums, wait, talk, goblin
Stray you rat, gay sack, rubber grip, gay strap
Push your fucking day back
Every fucking day's black
Every bloody always now, speaking lion's always down
The stories shit but I want to watch you cut and bleed
All these lies, and cuts, and pleads, I want to watch disease

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Trash Talk and the black hawk
This the shit that make all the kids pull their gats out
Fucking blast off, go ahead and grab the chainsaw
And take your cast off with your mask off (Trash Wang)
Now, watch the guitar riff, hit them drums with a large stick
And hope you hear that fucking bass, trying to sit still in the fucking mosh pit
Talking trash I'm breaking bad, and snorting glass, my port is head
Because out my mind, I'll show you fucks, Doc TC in a fucking demon pit

[Chorus: Lee Spielman]
