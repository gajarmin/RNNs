[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] And, since we 'bout to go, in a few
[Sacario] Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

[Sacario] Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly way, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all[Angie]
Welcome to "Animal House"
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'mma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a "Hello" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I wanna make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album #3 and
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently #1 at 3 with videos on MTV
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Hook]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high cuz we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high cuz we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire cuz what I propose is a resonation
Cuz the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and "ang" espacio

[Hook]

[Verse: Angie]
Look I'mma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant cuz bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearseals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
Through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin
I know you got hate in your blood it's still hurtin

[Hook] - repeat 2XIt's a big deal now, It's official now
Shut 'em down.Wha'cha think we ain't got beats?
We got beats.anyway you wanna do it
Uh.Sacario.Uh
You ready?.Let's Go

Look at Shorty My nigga introduced us
I neva told a Shorty I said Dema la Puca
She said Orjay Flicka
But that's how I talk but see what I get though
I got the baddest shortys you see on Stretch-Lo
Can't let go You had to see me in Copa
Before E used to G shortys on Sodas
In Cub Vinals spit the same G on the sofa
In Club Red in Miami the G was even colder
Peep what I tell ya with the Sex on the Beach
In cup arm wrapped around the shoulder its over
And she knew what I was talking about
My games' sick (Like What?)
Like someone came and coughed in my mouth
I get tilted by the pound and of course on the house
And you know I'm from up North so I floss in the South
They want to know what New York is about
Cause they been sayin No Doubt before Gwen Steffani was out
Come On

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

(you can't be serious.uh.Sacario)
Playa's ya'll play y'all position
I got so much game I need a license from the gaming commission
You in training listen I've been with famous women
Cause I ain't a kid I don't talk lame or diss 'em
When I see 'em don't even kiss 'em not on the cheek
Windows on the truck rolled up pockets is deep
Niggas tryin peak through the tints wha'cha you wanna see?
All you seein is the glow of the TV Believe me
I ain't wit the big crowds on the low like Chris Childs
Wanna hear me flow I can spit but only Crystal
Grippin a pistal know these niggas pissed now
Used to be stand up niggas now they just sit down
Look at this clown look who he's runnin' wit
No not Michel Johnson the only one who's runnin' shit
Be the type to take pictures in front of whips
I'm the type to have my girl kiss and bag another bitch

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

(This is how it's gonna be.uh.from now till forever)

Hey yo I'm Six One shorty know her man is little
I smell like Meakai she smell like a bag a Skittles
I ball shoot jump shots stand and dribble
Hit threes that mean triplets I'm in the middle
Big whips me and my nizzle for shizzle on the rizzle
I stay switchin my stizzle your style flow like a drizzle
I'm like a real bizzle that's bliz-ed
I don't walk if I'm not in a whip I'm on my pivot
You know metaphors I'm knee deep in
Niggas need to shut up they talk about like they got free weekends
I be on the Deacon cause its major like Lee when
That's all I know how to shorty you too young
Don't make me pow pow you and leave you with two sons
I'm not that type a foul dude when I'm on the line
Shoot five for five wit out even tryin'
Only time they call me small change when I come with dimes
Come On

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

But if you keep sleepin on Joe it just could result to violence
A couple of shots a clear the place
Brrrrraaaappppp! Cocksuckers we here to stay
It's the cook coke man, one 'mo gain
How the fuck you gettin dough when you look broke man?
It's the mink coat man, cost me nothin
See me jumpin in the pool with it just for frontin
And the chicks love the fat guy, I wish it's cause of the dick
But I bet it's cause of the chips and the fast life
Me and Ange livin big forever
Think a click fuckin with this man whatever

[Chorus: Sacario]
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that dough, you don't need a nigga that trip
And everybody with car keys only big car keys

And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please

[Verse 2: Angie Martinez]
Oh! It's just me the O.G
And since this live big let's start with B.I.G
And rep it for Big Pun and do it for Big L
And since I got a big truck you know I live well
On the remix, other stations I can't agree with
I been here for ten years ain't never leavin
It's been clear I went there so you could see shit
Let them fear we not scared it ain't a secret
Hope you prepared in the streets get ready
Cause we keep this steady, Animal House piece is heavy
Do more hotlines than hot nine
Keep your hand on your mouth cause we get very
Ugly out there, trust me out there
They love me out there, from Miami back to here
It's a new day I'm battin up, with homeruns
Sacario four album and I'm droppin this summer

[Chorus: Sacario]
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that dough, you don't need a nigga that trip

Pull out your car keys everybody please

Spend that though, even on a remix chick
And everybody with car keys only big car keys
Pull out your car keys everybody please

[Verse 3: Sacario]
Mr. (?) still eat where you won't be seated
Still shop where you won't be greated
Since the double XL there ain't a spot that they don't be peakin
And live big number one record northeast region
So stop breathin, I'll let you shop for scraps soon after I eat
This is the remix back with the beat
Clowns, take them scraps home don't be proud
Cristal don't make tops so we don't drink we pour our
I know I make you sick so call out
Like my soles latino crowds stomp the floor out
Sacario crew, still tigre out
Sixty deep at Jimmy's and I got the technicians with me
I'm just here to take all y'all chicks
To make all this money and drive all y'all sick
And I never, 'gon, stop remix
My own shit is problems whenever I drop

[Chorus: Sacario]
Live big all my shorties you know who you is
Spend that dough, you don't need a nigga that trip
And everybody with car keys only big car keys

Pull out your car keys everybody please

[Outro: Angie Martinez]
(Laughing) It's the remix baby, Animal House, Angela, Sacario, Joe Crack
It's a new day[Hook: Sacario and Drake]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 1: Drake]
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take [?]
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It's hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all [?] but a ways it could sound
[?] loud and go and put her face to the town

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sacario]
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I'm not a rapper it's not cause I am
It's cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin'
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
Or watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like I [?]
We don't like no [?] nada
Rappin' [?] until you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think [?] a pop star?
Sacario

In Cub Vinals spit the same G on the sofa
In Club Red in Miami the G was even colder
Peep what I tell ya with the Sex on the Beach
In cup arm wrapped around the shoulder its over
And she knew what I was talking about
My games' sick (Like What?)
Like someone came and coughed in my mouth
I get tilted by the pound and of course on the house
And you know I'm from up North so I floss in the South
They want to know what New York is about
Cause they been sayin No Doubt before Gwen Steffani was out
Come On

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

(you can't be serious.uh.Sacario)
Playa's ya'll play y'all position
I got so much game I need a license from the gaming commission
You in training listen I've been with famous women
Cause I ain't a kid I don't talk lame or diss 'em
When I see 'em don't even kiss 'em not on the cheek
Windows on the truck rolled up pockets is deep
Niggas tryin peak through the tints wha'cha you wanna see?
All you seein is the glow of the TV Believe me
I ain't wit the big crowds on the low like Chris Childs
Wanna hear me flow I can spit but only Crystal
Grippin a pistal know these niggas pissed now
Used to be stand up niggas now they just sit down
Look at this clown look who he's runnin' wit
No not Michel Johnson the only one who's runnin' shit
Be the type to take pictures in front of whips
I'm the type to have my girl kiss and bag another bitch

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

(This is how it's gonna be.uh.from now till forever)

Hey yo I'm Six One shorty know her man is little
I smell like Meakai she smell like a bag a Skittles
I ball shoot jump shots stand and dribble
Hit threes that mean triplets I'm in the middle
Big whips me and my nizzle for shizzle on the rizzle
I stay switchin my stizzle your style flow like a drizzle
I'm like a real bizzle that's bliz-ed
I don't walk if I'm not in a whip I'm on my pivot
You know metaphors I'm knee deep in
Niggas need to shut up they talk about like they got free weekends
I be on the Deacon cause its major like Lee when
That's all I know how to shorty you too young
Don't make me pow pow you and leave you with two sons
I'm not that type a foul dude when I'm on the line
Shoot five for five wit out even tryin'
Only time they call me small change when I come with dimes
Come On

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

Hahahaha
Ya'll Ain't ready for me[Hook: Sacario and Drake]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 1: Drake]
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take [?]
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It's hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all [?] but a ways it could sound
[?] loud and go and put her face to the town

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sacario]
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I'm not a rapper it's not cause I am
It's cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin'
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
Or watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like I [?]
We don't like no [?] nada
Rappin' [?] until you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think [?] a pop star?
Sacario

[Hook]
