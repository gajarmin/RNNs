[Intro]
What's up man, hey yo what's up
Yeah what's going on here?
Sick and tired of 5-0 running up on the block here
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, Snow they came around here looking for you the other day
Word, word, bust it!

[Hook - Snow]
Informer, you no say: "daddy, me Snow, me I'll go blame"
A licky boom-boom down!
Detective-mon said daddy me Snow me stab someone down the lane
I lick he bum-bum down!

[Verse 1 - Snow]
Police them comin in for me now they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So then they put me in the back the car at the station
From that point on me reach my destination
When the destination reached it was the east detention
Where them whipped down me pants looked up me bottom so

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snow]
Bigger they are they think they have more power
They're on the phone me say that on (every) hour
Me for want to use it once an' now me call me lover
Lover who I'll be callin is the one Tammy
An' me love her in me heart down to my belly
Yes me daddy me Snow me I feel cool and deadly
As the one MC Shan an' the one daddy Snow

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snow]
Listen for me you better listen for me now
When me rocking the microphone me rock it steady
Yes sir daddy me Snow me are the article don
But in the in an' the out of a dance them they say where you come from
People them say you come from Jamaica

Pure black people, mon that's all I mon know

[Hook]

Yes say me Daddy me Snow me I'll go reaching at the top, so

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - MC Shan]
Me sitting 'round cool with my dibbie-dibbie girl
Police knock my door, lick up my pal
Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring
Take me to the station black up my hands
Trail me down cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What I'm gonna do? I'm backed and I'm trapped
Slap me in the face and took all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour
They wanna tell you a little story about where they come from

[Hook]
The Bridge, Queensbridge (Repeat 4X)

You love to hear the story again and again
Of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

[Hook]

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean T-Tom
A brother who's known for his rap - Jappy Jap
Larry Larr, third least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
Phase Brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door get frisked, just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town then you couldn't fight and win
But every time they had a jam they couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there in the parks they had to cease
Cause you was in

[Hook]

Why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit your ass had better run
Cause you're in

[Hook]

Dimples D the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was Sucker DJ's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn out
By any place any part of the world
And while I'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
While she's in

[Hook]

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you may
Don't ever listen to what nobody say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
They're trying to lead your destiny
By the time you think about it you're grown
Then you say goddamn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Which people always pulling always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pulling you back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause they're not with it
You're talking about school
They're talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time will fly
But you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause I'm reaching for mine
And I'm from

[Hook](Aiyyo calm down, fall back!
Y'all Queensbridge always fightin up in here!)

[Marley Marl]
Ladies and gentlemen, we got Queensbridge Finest up in this mothafucker
Tonight
They just came from war
They wanna let you know a little something about where they come from

"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge"

[MC Shan]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to +Kill That Noise+

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight

[Cormega]
Yo it ain't just the music
Hoop aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

[Millennium Thug]
Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin me
Six blocks, losin my mind
Runnin from D's
These P's got me usin my nine, I pop off

[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin over strollers (Slippin Sova)
In Queens, you be the victim till you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin it crunk
So much be jumpin off I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga

[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, "T.O.N.Y." remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it

[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get rained on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar'n
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin
G.O.D., Nitty and Twin in
The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

[Nas]
Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, AR fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your ho, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed cuz

[Hook] *repeat to fade*
Keep on rockin the Bridge and keep rockin
If the beats stop rockin, the Bridge'll keep rockinRhyming is a thing that I do at will
Be glad to rock a party just to prove my skill
J-u-ice is what I'm gaining
With a style so fresh that it's self-explaining
Never bite a rhyme, I don't live that way
But when I get dissed, violators pay
I'm a crowd motivator, MC annihilator
Never front the move cause I'm not a perpetrator
I don't really mind bein criticized
But those who try to make fame on my name - die
Rhymes of all styles, all categories
From fresh freestyles to real fly stories
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
And if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

I devastate the crowd while the record spins
So-called competitors have no wins
I laugh at MC's who call me wack
You ordered, and now I'm gonna serve you, Jack
We're respected by all, treated just like kings
How could you have the nerve to say such things?
If you knew at the time what you were saying
You wouldn't be on your knees - praying
You gotta understand I'm not the average MC
At the first sign of trouble grab the mic and flee
Grab the mic, plug in the beat box jacks
Prepare for the battle, then proceed to wax
Take as much time I feel is ample
To duff an MC to be made example
This goes for all sucker MC chumps
Who hear my name, and suddenly Kool-Aid pumps
So if you're thinking 'bout dissing me, better think twice
Cause next time, brother, I won't be so nice
You can come all alone or bring all your boys
But if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

(South Bronx)
Kill that, kill that noise (Repeat x8)

I must say MC's got a lot of spunk
To get up on stage and pop so much junk
I'm not worried cause I don't get waxed
And you wouldn't believe how hard I max
School's in session, I'm about to teach
Versatile with a style that you just can't reach
Lesson number one: first strike aim
You shouldn't do things to degrade my name
Your records won't sell cause the people won't buy em
A sucker MC's like chicken - I fry him
I started with a smash, I'mma leave with a bang
And to put it to you bluntly - MC's can't hang
Your boys and your family will be grieving your death
Weeping while they're sweeping up the pieces I left
You can come all alone or bring all your boys
But if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

[Marley Marl]
Yo Shan, I didn't hear you say hip hop started in the Bridge on your record?

[MC Shan]
I didn't, they wanted to get on the bandwagon

Because I rhyme so fly, girls can't resist
But her man can't understand, so he gets pissed
Like a preacher at work, when she hurt I'll heal her
I'll leap, you sleep, and believe I steal her
My mama used to say be a ladies man
I used to always wonder why she named me Shan
Not hard to pronounce, easy to spell
And oh how I love it when the ladies yell
Her man better chill when my jacket's unzipped
I got a .25 with an 8 shot clip
You're sayin to yourself that's a BB gun
But the place that I'mma shoot ya it'll take just one
I'll rip you into parts, little pieces and specks
You'll be saying to yourself "What can happen next?"
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
But if you knew what I knew, then you'd kill that noise

Shoulda stayed in school, learned comprehension
Trying to state facts that I did not mention
Sucker MC's I hate the most
Next time I make a record you should listen close
Cause MC's like me are the real McCoys
So you sucker MC's better kill that noise

Marley you trying to diss us, man
What's wrong with that, I took care of that
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
KRS-One and Scott La Rock
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yo, he talk about strung on something
Man, we cold cooling in the place
Drivin fresh Audis and coupes
What's wrong with y'all
Strung?
The only thing we strung on is music
And you strung on ours(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)

She was this girl that I know named Jane
She used to be cool, now the girl's insane
Now all Jane does is walk around all day
Sayin, "Beam me up, Scotty, take me away!"
Now I remember Jane from back in the day
When she used to go to school, get all straight A's
Now you see Jane on the street corner
Stoppin every car anytime she wanna
Whatever went wrong, the facts remain
But who could think this woulda happen to sweet old Jane

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)

Jane's lifestory was a tragic one
She started gettin high, cause she said it was fun
There was no party, just a meeting of friends
And then the question arose: who got ends?
It went around, they had 300 in all
Somebody yelled out: "We're gonna have a ball!"
Steve grabbed the money and ran down the block
Came back and said, "Y'all, take a look at this rock!"
Jane was gettin into somethin heavy that night
"Hurry up quick, somebody give me a light!"
[Name] said "Hold it!", he was pullin too fast
But Jane was amused by the smoke in the glass
She was tickled to death at the faces they made
"Puttin fire to the glass, don't you think it won't break?"
In a flick of a flash the torch was lit
She put it to her mouth, and she took a hit
Smoke rushed from her lungs and up to her brain
This was the beginning of the end of Jane

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)

Jane got weak, and the bass got strong
What she used to do right, Jane now does wrong
I walked past one day, called my man Jack
She almost broke her neck cause she thought I said "crack"
It had to be a week since I seen her that day
But the body that she had just wasted away
When she used to walk by, we used to say she looked chill
But now as she passes, everybody go (ill!)
The girlie we saw hop off Mercedes Benz
She was on it so hard, she started stealin from friends
To all the drug dealers she was so in debt
That she sold her VCR and her TV set
Jane used to live the life as the storybook tells
Now everything she gets, she eventually sells
Sneak around the corner when you see Jane comin
She'll be touchin on your clothes, the girl be crumbin

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)

If you know a girl who was the quiet type
Who acts kinda funny and a bit too hype
These kinda actions only mean one thing
She's only buggin like that cause she's suckin the thing
Not only the girls, it can happen to guys
But the fellas try to beat you, then they greet you with lies
One day Jane coulda been my honey
I just couldn't wait till the girl made 20
I see her nowadays, and all I do is sing
(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)

(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(3x)

[variations of (Jane) repeated till end][Intro: MC Shan]
She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I'd turn to her and say that, "I'm
Infatuated by your lovely smile
And some day soon we're gonna walk the isle"
She'd say, "You're my everything, my strength for life
Be the mother of your children, as well as your wife"
She used to tell me all the time, I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[Verse 1: MC Shan]
Coincidental how I met her
But when I seen her I knew that I'd get her
Can't let her step, she look too good
But my wears made me seem like a stone cold hood
I'm a lucky guy, so I press my luck
I step to her, ah what the fuck
Went her way, took a few steps past her
Got the nerve, and then I asked her
I said, "Yo baby," and she started to reach
I said, "Whoa, don't get excited, that's a figure of speech"
She told me her name, gave her number and all
And when I stepped, she said I better call
It took about a month, but she was finally mine
Everything was going smooth, we were doin' fine
After a while it wasn't no thing
We were either holding hands or she was under my wing
She used to whisper in my hear I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[Hook: TJ Swan]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I never did you wrong
And it seems we had such a love that was so strong

[Verse 2: MC Shan]
On the day she broke out, would you believe I cried?
And it hurts so much to think of how she lied
I shared everything to the very last penny
Somethin' that you really can't do with many
Since this young lady was such a big winner
I'd treat her all the time to a candle light dinner
Have a violinist play a real sweet song
And she never showed a sign that somethin' was wrong
My boy used to say (Man Shan, I'd quit her)
But she seemed so happy every time I'm with her
We used to hold hands and walk in the rain
And on the days I felt down she eased my pain
This was just too far-fetched to believe
To think that my girl would just up and leave
Imagine that - I just couldn't
Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldn't
All of a sudden a lot of things changed
She started actin' funny, I mean a bit strange
We had little squabbles, arguments, fights
Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights
I'd say, "Baby, where you been for all that time?
She cuddled me close and say that I'd
Be the one that she call her only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[Hook: TJ Swan]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say

[Verse 3: MC Shan]
She put it to me plain, couldn't put it no clearer
Lipstick written on the bedroom mirror
Said, 'I'm leaving you now, and I know that you'll miss me
You're probably saying: Damn, man, why she dissed me?
But you see, I felt that it was time to go
Then I packed my bags, and I'm leavin', so
You take care and I hope you live long
And don't worry, there's nothing that you did wrong
You'll find the right girl someday, you'll see
Why I'm the type of woman that must be free'
I said, "Why me?" and fell to the bed
Reached for the 9 and put it to my head
And thought about the words that she once said
(Shan, you know that you're my one and only)
But she ran with another man and left my lonely

[Outro: TJ Swan]
O-o-o-oh girl, oh my girl
Why'd you have to leave?
Leave me so sad
Girl, you broke my heart
Oh, you drive me wild
You leave me by myself
All by myself
Girl, I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Ooh so wild
Baby drive me crazy
Leave me by myself
Leave me all alone
By the phone
I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Oh so wild
When I saw you leave me
Makes me want to cry
Girl, I'm breakin' down
Breakin' down
Yo, I don't know what to do

(Love)It might've took a while
But you knew I had to hit you with a brand new funky rhyme
Guess you already know, so I'm ready to go
Marlon, hit me with the beat one time
Right now I'm gonna introduce myself
So y'all know just who I be
All you suckers in the house stay quiet as a mouse
Instead of Shan call me Mr. MC
I'm goin back to the basics

When I was just a young boy, who ever would've thought
I'd grow up to be an MC
But my rhymes are so nice that they paid my price
Because fortune and fame ain't free
These words I'm recitin are written in a style
That you ain't heard in a long time
And a song like this'll make a rapper reminisce
About the days when he was in his prime
I ain't never lost no battles yet
What made you think I would?
How many times does it take, all the rappers I break
And you still don't think I'm good
This girl in my class tried to move too fast
When she tried to pull down my zipper
Well, things got strange when the whole scene changed
And I all out tried to strip her
Teacher stepped in between, sent me straight to the Dean
That's where I thought my journey ended
Call your moms up to school, are you some fool?
And forget about bein suspended
You went back to the basics

Here's the story on how I got started
Yes, way back in the day
With my man Infinite, Jazzy [Name], Akim
And fly girl Roxanne Shant
People used to hear that our crew was nice
But rappers just had to be convinced
And those who walked through 12th Street tried to say a rhyme
You seen or heard from em since
We sent em back to the basics

Yes yes y'all, it's like this y'all
MC Shan with a brand new twist y'all
One day when me and Marley Marl was playin in a ditch
We made this jam that we knew would slam
And some day it would make us rich
Marley Marl had B-36 bass bottoms
And he cut you up on the spot
And with my rhymes combined all the papers got signed
And 'The B-B-B-B-Bridge' got dropped
We went back to the basicsIt might've took a while
But you knew I had to hit you with a brand new funky rhyme
Guess you already know, so I'm ready to go
Marlon, hit me with the beat one time
Right now I'm gonna introduce myself
So y'all know just who I be
All you suckers in the house stay quiet as a mouse
Instead of Shan call me Mr. MC
I'm goin back to the basics

And with my rhymes combined all the papers got signed
And 'The B-B-B-B-Bridge' got dropped
We went back to the basicsLet me rock this rhyme only if I may
It's directed to my man LL Cool J
Your brand new jam sure does sound sweet
You +Rocked the Bells+ but you stole my beat

Me and Marley Marl, we designed it well
You added some percussion, thought we could not tell
It will be my glory to tell this story
It will even be rocked in your territory
Think they're so slick that they can't be greased
What I really hate most be biting MC's
To make their own would be a total waste
Let me tell you what happened in this one case
Turned on the radio station of my choice
When I heard my beat with the next man's voice
Put it on tape and I played it again
It just couldn't be, so I asked my friend
He didn't wanna hurt my feelings, so he said "I guess"
Played it one more time, homeboy said "yes"
I got so mad that I wanted to scream
But I sat and wrote a rhyme to release my steam
It just so happened that we met some place
I confronted this beat biter face to face
I asked did he do it and of course he denied
So I had to say, homeboy, I let that slide
To this here story there is no end
I'm just waiting for the sucker kid to do it again
I was just so shocked when I heard his cut
I called his girl everything but a sleazebag slut
Beat biters I devour like a three course meal
So be careful next time whose beat you steal
That's not really what this song is about
But if you steal my beats, I'm taking you out

The lyrics that I use in my rhymes are so nice
You press rewind and say, "Man, I got to hear that twice"
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Saying things like that, you must be sick
I feel sorry for those souls, it really makes me sad
Telling stories of the battles that they never had
I'm the root - my rhyme the tree
As essential to my mind as my eyes must see
I expand one's thoughts to the very extreme
Have you thinking something's real when it's only a dream
If I was a perpetrator I'd feel ashamed
Putting silly words together that all sound the same
If they elected Presidents for fresh rhymes that they wrote
I'd be the winner hands down, they'd abolish the vote
Because I'm quiet at times don't mean I don't have heart
I be praying half the time please, don't let me start
Cause once I start I'm gonna cold get ill
And at times it takes a posse just to make me chill
I say, brother, let's do this right
First we'll drink tea, and then we'll fight
So what I made a jam on the mellow side
It was something worthwhile, so I kept my pride
Now that my neck is out of the noose
Rock parties so hard that you gotta get loose

When you were just a kid with your runny nose
With your everlasting sneakers and your bummy clothes
Before you ever thought of making rap your trade
You were dreaming of Adidas while I got paid
Now you're sitting there wondering how I know
About the days when you used to be an MC ho
People souped you up, told you you were nice
Not only rock 'em once, rock your weak rhymes twice
For guys like you they should create an award
For the most attempts and the least that scored
See, I'm a rhyme writer, Marley mixes my cuts
I adore fly girls and I spit on sluts
I hold the rap population in the palm of my hand
Little children saying, "Ma, I wanna be like Shan"
I got the knowledge to know, the wisdom to speak
The understanding of my rhymes is at its fullest peak
There were a lot of MC's that tried to riff
But they wound up on the slabs as an MC stiff
No typographical errors, God bless the dead
Don't take it too light, these things I said
Final judgment over all like a full-fledged king
So my sentence to death, others never to sing
I'm chilling for the moment, yes, my friend
In a minute I be making six g's times ten
This might put you in a state of shock
It's not how much you make, it's how good you rock
Just to let you know who's DJ's greater
Marley'll wax, buff and Simonize Cut Creator(Aiyyo calm down, fall back!
Y'all Queensbridge always fightin up in here!)

[Marley Marl]
Ladies and gentlemen, we got Queensbridge Finest up in this mothafucker
Tonight
They just came from war
They wanna let you know a little something about where they come from

"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge"

[MC Shan]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to +Kill That Noise+

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight

[Cormega]
Yo it ain't just the music
Hoop aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

[Millennium Thug]
Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin me
Six blocks, losin my mind
Runnin from D's
These P's got me usin my nine, I pop off

[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin over strollers (Slippin Sova)
In Queens, you be the victim till you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin it crunk
So much be jumpin off I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga

[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, "T.O.N.Y." remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it

[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get rained on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar'n
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin
G.O.D., Nitty and Twin in
The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

[Nas]
Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, AR fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your ho, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed cuz

[Hook] *repeat to fade*
Keep on rockin the Bridge and keep rockin
If the beats stop rockin, the Bridge'll keep rockinMy name is MC Shan, my destiny is the stars
Being driven around in the freshest cars
All his beats and my rhymes are chill
Now I'm back once again ready to get ill
The beat's not fake, the rhyme's hardcore
My name is MC Shan and I'm down by law

There's been this rumor going around
About low life crabs saying I ain't down
But all MC's will feel my wrath
The system is my power the mic is my staff
I have the power of command, the power of lust
After battles all papers read

(Another one bites the dust)

All across the country I know I'm hated
Not only by crews I've devastated
Don't ask how I know, I just can tell
By the tone of your voice as you wish me well
Filled with so much envy that your face turns green
Cause my name rings bells on the Hip Hop scene
So pull out a bottle let the champagne pour
Fly rhymes so that makes me down by law

(Another one bites the dust)

Creeping across the nation like a midnight storm
Always rock a jam every time I perform
Records I make are not distorted
Made in New York and not imported
Have never been known to make an error
Crews see me coming, their heart fill with terror
Dip out the back when I step on the scene
Watch the back door, you'll see what I mean
I love to rock a party every time I can
My DJ's Marley Marl and I am MC Shan
We make the freshest jams that you've ever heard
Marlon ain't we down?

(Word!)

Now that we've come to the very end
His beats my rhymes are a perfect blend
We are the ones all others admire
To be like us is their desire
Never get angry always stay calm
Yet do as much damage as a nuclear bomb
Do or say anything we may
We destroy all objects in our way
As expensive as diamonds, precious as pearls
Rap so strong, take all y'all girls
Make cold cash money, do much much more
My name is MC Shan and I'm down by law[Intro]
What's up man, hey yo what's up
Yeah what's going on here?
Sick and tired of 5-0 running up on the block here
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, Snow they came around here looking for you the other day
Word, word, bust it!

[Hook - Snow]
Informer, you no say: "daddy, me Snow, me I'll go blame"
A licky boom-boom down!
Detective-mon said daddy me Snow me stab someone down the lane
I lick he bum-bum down!

[Verse 1 - Snow]
Police them comin in for me now they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So then they put me in the back the car at the station
From that point on me reach my destination
When the destination reached it was the east detention
Where them whipped down me pants looked up me bottom so

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snow]
Bigger they are they think they have more power
They're on the phone me say that on (every) hour
Me for want to use it once an' now me call me lover
Lover who I'll be callin is the one Tammy
An' me love her in me heart down to my belly
Yes me daddy me Snow me I feel cool and deadly
As the one MC Shan an' the one daddy Snow
Together we-a love 'em as a Tor-Na-Do

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Snow]
Listen for me you better listen for me now
When me rocking the microphone me rock it steady
Yes sir daddy me Snow me are the article don
But in the in an' the out of a dance them they say where you come from
People them say you come from Jamaica
But me born an' raised in the ghetto that's the one I want you to know
Pure black people, mon that's all I mon know
Yeah me shoes are tear up an' me toes used to show
Where me born in on the one Toronto so

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Snow]
Come with a nice young lady
Intelligent, yes she's gentle and irie
Everywhere me go me never left her at all
Yes its daddy Snow me are the roam dance mon
Roam between a dancing in a in a nation-a
You never know say daddy me Snow me are the Boom Shakata
Me never lay-a down flat in that one cardboard box
Yes say me Daddy me Snow me I'll go reaching at the top, so

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - MC Shan]
Me sitting 'round cool with my dibbie-dibbie girl
Police knock my door, lick up my pal
Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring
Take me to the station black up my hands
Trail me down cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What I'm gonna do? I'm backed and I'm trapped
Slap me in the face and took all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer[Verse 1]
The way I shine, I got splendor
I'm the real thing and not a pretender
You get the nerve to pop the fatal question
I'm takin the time to make a small suggestion
Write a will for your family's conveniency
Rappers I serve without mercy or leniency
No frame of mind, no heart, I'm relentless
Step to me, I'm knockin you senseless
I planted my seeds, so don't try to uproot me
You do better tryin to straight up shoot me
I'm not just a writer, I'm a real idealist
It won't be long until you try to steal this
Make your head swell till your eyes start to dilate
Yeah sucker, you better not violate
Not one MC in the world I'm afraid of
Have you screamin my name like your girl when I slayed her
This is the long cause I can't take a short take
Softer than cream between pieces of shortcake
There's no chance of you havin a mistrial
The very next time that I get dissed I'll
Sit back and write a rhyme stronger than Hercules
Funky parts, I got back and I circle these
Put em together, fix the conjuction
Then I'mma bust rhymes till my brain malfunctions
Dare to degrade my name, that's perjury
War's declared, so prepare to have surgery
Cut you with a rhyme of such a high fidelity
Give a kick like a Roland and you'se as soft as a melody
Since you're chalk my rhymes will erase ya
Want a piece of that ass so bad I could taste ya
Faced rappers from wack, ill, to even notorious
You may be clever, you'll be never victorious
I feel free now that I cleared this
How could I fell off, boy, I helped pioneer this

[Verse 2]
Violators, I go vic em
When I hear.. it's like "sick em!"
I transform just like a Decepticon
And once I step to you, boy, you're 'bout to be stepped upon
Say rhyme after rhyme back to back, so consecutive
Appointed rap's chairman, the highest executive
No time to grieve, you won't believe I slapped ya
Change the timeframe and still barely capture
Ask em who's their dad and if they're not sayin me
If he wasn't deceased, then he gotta be payin me
I'm super superb, Mister Fanstastic
No relation to drugs, but this is dope on plastic
Don't try to play heroic and be Mr. Braveman
My rhymes become a whip and beat you down like a slavehand
If this is what you deserve I serve you with justice
Be as sharp as a pin and still can't bust this
Just name one time that Shan get jetted on
If you did get light, boy, now who you think shedded on?
My rhymes to your mind is like a breath to freshen up
This is not a threat, feel free about steppin up
Once I'm on I'll think about gettin off
Play me close or out of post and I bet that I be lettin off
Rap is a game that you shouldn't indulge in
My rhymes are so good they keep my pockets bulgin
To delight I sit back and write a rhyme like this one
Relax, grab the buddah and proceed to twist one
By then you might as well tell your boys nice knowin ya
The next time they see ya, I'll probably be hoein ya
Cause I write rhymes in more than just two scoops
And Puma's the brand cause the Klan makes Troops
There's no competition cause there ain't no comp
Fuck around with this and get a mudhole stomp
I feel free now that I cleared this
How could I fell off, boy, I helped pioneer this

[Verse 3]
This throne is mine, I'll never sell or forfeit
So all you no-name rappers better get up off it
Although I been chill in, man, the villain that's still in me
But sayin I fell off is worse than killin me
Marley sets the time for the rhyme to be ready by
One-two-three (yo man, put him to beddy-bye)
You cease to exist, I be your pitfall
You think that this is harsh? That ain't shit, y'all
Placed in the ground in wood as encasement
Those that bluffed got stuffed in the basement
Most of the time myself I kept to and
Obtain the rep that you're scared to step to
Don't assume I leave, no room to evade
Gettin out, that I doubt, so prepare to be slaved
You're neither here nor there, I'm number uno, priority
Rhymes ????? shows my authority
Shanté, me, Bizzy and Kane are her protégés
Takin out Rush you know why? We know the way
We're down with the Juice, don't you think that's virtue
Dare to make fun of us and one of us'll hurt you
Whoever's the closest, I mean that the nearest will
Remove so many rappers you be callin us Clearasil
I feel free now that I cleared this
How could I fell off, boy, I helped pioneer thisWhat's wrong with you, man?
You crazy!

Highly acclaimed that's Shan the epitome of rhymes
Can't dance so you can't get rid of me
Line after line there's cause and effect
But I first test the mic with the 1-2 check
The Hip Hop world made the Juice Crew orphans
Gained our respect sealing up much coffins
We're all obligated to Juice Crew Laws
You'se a perk if you let a man take yours
Number 2 is not to follow, yo, you must set trends
And if you ain't down with us, you can't be friends
Many of my so-called boys just flip
But the thrill of it all - you're on the tip
You should be glad there is no tricks
On ours so hard we wrote your name on our...
Mix after mix every record we make
Don't compare or scare, so I dare you to take
Any part of the rhyme or the kick drum sound
I be meeting you, defeating you and beating you down
My name rings bells and make rappers petro
God help you, kid, when I get upset, yo
The bass starts to roll bid your fans farewell
Cause the chance of you winning is like snowing in hell
My rhymes say more than a tasket, a tisket
Too clever, yo, I never go out like a biscuit
Don't try to take my spot and not be legit
Try to fit my shoes and your feet won't fit
You're good, but compared to me you're not nearly
You think you can serve me? Come on, really
Til I can't breathe, yo, I'mma be with it
When I hear three words, you got it, I get it
My style is wild but strong and you're temporary
Violate the Juice Crew Laws and I bury
Send you to the land of peace and tranquility
Suckers have the knack but they lack my ability
Those who tried to dis in the days behind us
Back on the dick since the brothers signed us
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

Never too alert but I'm always cautious
And a few of 'em own a few Mercedes and Porsches
Suckers get paid by means of extortion
My rhymes take your mind by means of abortion
Rhymes create wings that time can't fly on
The mic that you bring on stage you'll die on
Sit back and watch your life get jettisoned
If rhymes were juice I'd be Con Edison
To have to say not have to do as accustomed
A sucker tried to snatch my chain and I bust him
I didn't cuff him and read him no rights
I knocked out his service and turned out his lights
Be a fool if you want and let your boys divert you
Soup you up to battle me, kid, and I'll hurt you
Superior intellect made me a phenomenon
And I can go on and on and on and on
You can be blind but my rhymes still focus
A sucker tried to violate law and I broke his
Albums and tapes and his compact discs
And his boys stood around and said (yo, he dissed you, Kris)
Straight up not split by a hyphen
Cut you to pieces without putting a knife in
You won't bleed but you feel just the same
Now answer me right, boy, what's my name?
(Shan) These words are for small in your window
Guaranteed to decipher the mice from the men though
Now that I have the power make a refinement
Revealing the snakes is my next assignment
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law

For those who betrayed me picture being afraid of me
A few I know wish they woulda never come played me
Though I'm decked in my suit you can't play me like rummy
Teach you how to rhyme, say Kris, dummy
The same theory if the words don't fit
Got the nerve to get on stage and wanna sing that...
Wait a minute, wait just a second
You know that's not my style - sorry, just checking
But don't it make you sick when they be kicking la-di-da-di
But I got what it take to make you wanna cold rock a party
Too hot to touch, too cold to hold ????? sadness
Junk you pop gets you dropped, stop the madness
My style is wild, my son, my child, selective
Lyrics they're tough, written rough and effective
I tangle ya, mangle ya, strangle ya and then maul ya
This goes for you and you and you and all ya
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew LawRhyming is a thing that I do at will
Be glad to rock a party just to prove my skill
J-u-ice is what I'm gaining
With a style so fresh that it's self-explaining
Never bite a rhyme, I don't live that way
But when I get dissed, violators pay
I'm a crowd motivator, MC annihilator
Never front the move cause I'm not a perpetrator
I don't really mind bein criticized
But those who try to make fame on my name - die
Rhymes of all styles, all categories
From fresh freestyles to real fly stories
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
And if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

I devastate the crowd while the record spins
So-called competitors have no wins
I laugh at MC's who call me wack
You ordered, and now I'm gonna serve you, Jack
We're respected by all, treated just like kings
How could you have the nerve to say such things?
If you knew at the time what you were saying
You wouldn't be on your knees - praying
You gotta understand I'm not the average MC
At the first sign of trouble grab the mic and flee
Grab the mic, plug in the beat box jacks
Prepare for the battle, then proceed to wax
Take as much time I feel is ample
To duff an MC to be made example
This goes for all sucker MC chumps
Who hear my name, and suddenly Kool-Aid pumps
So if you're thinking 'bout dissing me, better think twice
Cause next time, brother, I won't be so nice
You can come all alone or bring all your boys
But if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

(South Bronx)
Kill that, kill that noise (Repeat x8)

I must say MC's got a lot of spunk
To get up on stage and pop so much junk
I'm not worried cause I don't get waxed
And you wouldn't believe how hard I max
School's in session, I'm about to teach
Versatile with a style that you just can't reach
Lesson number one: first strike aim
You shouldn't do things to degrade my name
Your records won't sell cause the people won't buy em
A sucker MC's like chicken - I fry him
I started with a smash, I'mma leave with a bang
And to put it to you bluntly - MC's can't hang
Your boys and your family will be grieving your death
Weeping while they're sweeping up the pieces I left
You can come all alone or bring all your boys
But if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

[Marley Marl]
Yo Shan, I didn't hear you say hip hop started in the Bridge on your record?

[MC Shan]
I didn't, they wanted to get on the bandwagon

Because I rhyme so fly, girls can't resist
But her man can't understand, so he gets pissed
Like a preacher at work, when she hurt I'll heal her
I'll leap, you sleep, and believe I steal her
My mama used to say be a ladies man
I used to always wonder why she named me Shan
Not hard to pronounce, easy to spell
And oh how I love it when the ladies yell
Her man better chill when my jacket's unzipped
I got a .25 with an 8 shot clip
You're sayin to yourself that's a BB gun
But the place that I'mma shoot ya it'll take just one
I'll rip you into parts, little pieces and specks
You'll be saying to yourself "What can happen next?"
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
But if you knew what I knew, then you'd kill that noise

Shoulda stayed in school, learned comprehension
Trying to state facts that I did not mention
Sucker MC's I hate the most
Next time I make a record you should listen close
Cause MC's like me are the real McCoys
So you sucker MC's better kill that noise

Marley you trying to diss us, man
What's wrong with that, I took care of that
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
KRS-One and Scott La Rock
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yo, he talk about strung on something
Man, we cold cooling in the place
Drivin fresh Audis and coupes
What's wrong with y'all
Strung?
The only thing we strung on is music
And you strung on ours[Intro: MC Shan]
She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I'd turn to her and say that, "I'm
Infatuated by your lovely smile
And some day soon we're gonna walk the isle"
She'd say, "You're my everything, my strength for life
Be the mother of your children, as well as your wife"
She used to tell me all the time, I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[Verse 1: MC Shan]
Coincidental how I met her
But when I seen her I knew that I'd get her
Can't let her step, she look too good
But my wears made me seem like a stone cold hood
I'm a lucky guy, so I press my luck
I step to her, ah what the fuck
Went her way, took a few steps past her
Got the nerve, and then I asked her
I said, "Yo baby," and she started to reach
I said, "Whoa, don't get excited, that's a figure of speech"
She told me her name, gave her number and all
And when I stepped, she said I better call
It took about a month, but she was finally mine
Everything was going smooth, we were doin' fine
After a while it wasn't no thing
We were either holding hands or she was under my wing
She used to whisper in my hear I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[Hook: TJ Swan]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I never did you wrong
And it seems we had such a love that was so strong

[Verse 2: MC Shan]
On the day she broke out, would you believe I cried?
And it hurts so much to think of how she lied
I shared everything to the very last penny
Somethin' that you really can't do with many
Since this young lady was such a big winner
I'd treat her all the time to a candle light dinner
Have a violinist play a real sweet song
And she never showed a sign that somethin' was wrong
My boy used to say (Man Shan, I'd quit her)
But she seemed so happy every time I'm with her
We used to hold hands and walk in the rain
And on the days I felt down she eased my pain
This was just too far-fetched to believe
To think that my girl would just up and leave
Imagine that - I just couldn't
Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldn't
All of a sudden a lot of things changed
She started actin' funny, I mean a bit strange
We had little squabbles, arguments, fights
Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights
I'd say, "Baby, where you been for all that time?
She cuddled me close and say that I'd
Be the one that she call her only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

[Hook: TJ Swan]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say

[Verse 3: MC Shan]
She put it to me plain, couldn't put it no clearer
Lipstick written on the bedroom mirror
Said, 'I'm leaving you now, and I know that you'll miss me
You're probably saying: Damn, man, why she dissed me?
But you see, I felt that it was time to go
Then I packed my bags, and I'm leavin', so
You take care and I hope you live long
And don't worry, there's nothing that you did wrong
You'll find the right girl someday, you'll see
Why I'm the type of woman that must be free'
I said, "Why me?" and fell to the bed
Reached for the 9 and put it to my head
And thought about the words that she once said
(Shan, you know that you're my one and only)
But she ran with another man and left my lonely

[Outro: TJ Swan]
O-o-o-oh girl, oh my girl
Why'd you have to leave?
Leave me so sad
Girl, you broke my heart
Oh, you drive me wild
You leave me by myself
All by myself
Girl, I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Ooh so wild
Baby drive me crazy
Leave me by myself
Leave me all alone
By the phone
I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Oh so wild
When I saw you leave me
Makes me want to cry
Girl, I'm breakin' down
Breakin' down
Yo, I don't know what to do

There is no implication hip-hop is wrong
Beats tapped out, played back in songs
Consider hip-hop as a verbal sport
It brings pleasure while expressin one frame of thought
Those that don't like it, then you're psychotic
To my point of view hip-hop has got it
Rhymes being written everytime you blink
With no vital signs of becoming extinct
Try to demolish, it will not be worth
Killing all hip-hop fans on earth
Don't try to compare it, there's no relative
The word to describe hip-hop: creative
Once you're at a party you're in hip-hop's lair
To downgrade all, how could one dare?
Once upon a time they used to play soul
]From there they went to rock 'n roll
Rock died down, then along came pop
Now you're livin in the world of hip-hop

I am the creator of my hip-hop style
With a level of college understood by child
Hip-hop is being moved on a one-way course
Up and being led by an unseen force
You try to hold it down, won't be no good
The more it gets exposed, the more it gets understood
It's all fantasy, yet all realistic
Often complicated, other times simplistic
Lyrics so sharp, they can cut like a knife
I'm sworn by oath to the hip-hop life
Less live drums, less guitar strumming
Hip-hop is the life of the up and coming
Not by force, by want and choice
Persuaded by the beat and the MC voice
There are people who love it across the land
And there are those that think that it should be banned
Well I say I love it, it comes from my heart
Very thankful for the day that it got its start
Now that it got started, you see it won't stop

The only thing you could do that would make me mad
Is take away my pen and my hip-hop pad
Take that away, I have nothing left
So let it go free or sentence me to death
I know you had troubles with your moms and dad
When you were growin up goin through your childhood bad
Some parents think that hip-hop means
Wearin fat shoe laces and name brand jeans
It really doesn't matter just what you say
Hip-hop will be around till you're old and grey
They're just all lies created by nerds
You think that I'm playin, you mark my words
Just like man sends rockets to Mars
Hip-hop living is ascending to stars
The more it gets accepted, you'll see it won't drop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

Runnin neck to neck in the music world race
You don't have to listen if it isn't your taste
It's becoming worldwide, internationally known
Have you ever heard the saying 'to each his own'?
People like jazz, cause that's their taste
I prefer crisp highs with an earthquake bass
There are hip-hop songs that make you tense
And then there are those not worth 2 cents
But still hip-hop's gonna make its mark
Cause you used to only hear it in your neighborhood park
To all non-believers, you should know your name
Since the parks, don't you see how far the hip-hop came?
It's been around for years, and you ask yourself how?
For the very same reason that you're listening now
You might have been hooked from the very first line
Cause raps like these cultivate one's mind
One day your resistance level might drop
And you'll admit: it's a world of hip-hop

Straight from the MC's mouth you heard it
You have to bear witness cause you can't convert it
It's based on a beat with a real slight dip
Kool Herc came along and said, "That's hip"
Heads started bobbin, he began to hop
And he said, "Let's call this hip-hop"

All these beats and my rhymes attached
Form the new creation called the Marley Scratch
We're always steered in a positive course
His beats, my rhymes, combined make force
I say it's like a force cos the force is strong
And if you think we're weak I'd say you're wrong
All you other DJ's are a bunch of jerks
Marley give 'em an example how a DJ works

[Verse 2]
Since you just heard how a DJ sound
The name Marley Marl, I will break it down
The M is for Master of Scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
The A is a letter that you set apart
I wouldn't call his beats music, I would call it Art
The R just stands for the way he Rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock
The L is for Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sounds out of sight
The E is for Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
Don't play with the Y cos it isn't a game
You ax "Why do you put the other DJ's to shame?"
After this there shouldn't be a story to tell
At the end of that is M-A-R-L
This paragraph here has come to a end
Marley, can we hear your funky fresh scratchin' again?

[Verse 3]
I never got caught in the game of Tag
My name is MC Shan, no need to brag
MC's brag about theirself all through their rhyme
You can see I got quality, won't waste my time
If I did not mean it, I wouldn't have said it
I'm gonna give the man behind the wheels some credit
I'm not tryna say that he can't be beat
But Marley Marl can stand on his own two feet
Since a DJ like him is so in demand
Marley won't you get on and show 'em where you stand

[Verse 4]
He can go on but I won't insist
How many fortunate MC's have a DJ like this
Every time I grab the mic I always have a plan
He's DJ Marley Marl and I am MC Shan
Combined we're fresh, this you must admit
Don't ever wanna hear you say we ain't worth jack
To be a DJ or an MC well it isn't no thing
If you ever wanna learn then just give us a ring
Like I just said, it wasn't no thing
You either have to be a ace, a jack, a queen or a king
When you're one of these, that means you're the best
And the people of today won't settle for less
We can be a jack or king, we can play the place
But we'd rather be a DJ and an MC ace

[Verse 5]
If you ever wanna battle, be at your best
Because a man like Marley just does not fess
In that battle you must give your all
Or just be prepared to take your fall
Cos a lotta DJ's already tried
There ain't been one yet that's qualified
To think you can beat him, you must be nuts
Just listen real close to his scratchin' cuts

[Verse 6]
The man Marley Marl can bring you to tears
He's not a new jack, he been down for years
On the two turntables I would say he's nice
Every cut he makes is so precise
When I said precise inside my rhyme
To put it to you straight that means right on time
Every jam he throws he always rocked
Don't refer to him as the neighbourhood jock
To all you DJ's who are always fessin'
From this man you can learn a lesson
You heard Dimples D when she took her stand
She said (Marley Marl is one hell of a man)
..
Gotta get it off my chest, to put my mind at ease
Since when you heard a DJ make cuts like these?[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour
They wanna tell you a little story about where they come from

[Hook]
The Bridge, Queensbridge (Repeat 4X)

You love to hear the story again and again
Of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

[Hook]

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean T-Tom
A brother who's known for his rap - Jappy Jap
Larry Larr, third least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
Phase Brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door get frisked, just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town then you couldn't fight and win
But every time they had a jam they couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there in the parks they had to cease
Cause you was in

[Hook]

Why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit your ass had better run
Cause you're in

[Hook]

Dimples D the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was Sucker DJ's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn out
By any place any part of the world
And while I'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
While she's in

[Hook]

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you may
Don't ever listen to what nobody say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
They're trying to lead your destiny
By the time you think about it you're grown
Then you say goddamn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Which people always pulling always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pulling you back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause they're not with it
You're talking about school
They're talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time will fly
But you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause I'm reaching for mine
And I'm from

[Hook]The hip-hop sound went through stages
Embark on a trip as I flip through pages
This particular part 'bout a bridge on the Hudson
I first got hand by the rhymes and the cuts and
If I'm not mistaken makin' two records mix
And certain deejays had a few dope tricks
If you asked to be on you would be their guest, y'all
Say a few "ho"s and a "yes yes yes y'all"
They had battles of the neighborhood jocks
And I used to take the jam right straight to the box
Every now and then you'd hear gunshots ring
Just duck, what the fuck, yo, it ain't no thing
What I thought was shots was just a few pranksters
Were pow-pow-pow men juicin' the gangsters
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark

This was a time MCs used to bug out
Yo, what happened? (Yo, somebody pulled the plug out)
Just about the time when you jumped for joy
(Yo, you take my stage, I'mma kill you, boy)
Answer back and gettin smacked and your friends made jokes
(Hey, pack it up and get out of the park, folks)
But only to the cops we made some committment
I was shocked when the stick-up kids took the equipment
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park

In the winter time they moved the jams to the [?]
Do you think that the cold made the whole thing cease?
I recall seeing Flash one time - no, two
Can't forget about the Queensbridge Crew
For this is the place which I made my mark
And those who resist or try to diss get sparked
In the park after dark things really got cookin'
I seen the titles of idols and many chains get tooken
I seen the scatter of pack, letter for letter
If you wasn't from the town they'd beat you down
But these are just pieces of the ancient ways
But the rule still applies to the rhymes nowadays
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you used to do it out in the park
Let me hear you say "oh yeah!" (oh yeah!)
Oh yeah! (oh yeah!)

A time when...
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park

Dead dreams - still bought and sold
I strive and I strive to receive my goal
I'm still not happy up until this day
But I'm chill and I don't care what nobody say
Livin' and learnin' about the straight up deal
And got by cause I went by just what I feel
Cause I refuse to be mislead
By puttin' pipes to my lips and smoke in my head
Think about it, much, much later
Go to school and expand because knowledge is greater
But she chose to lead that fate
Eye to eye with a dick on a $5 date
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walkin' through life as if you were blind
You should reach for your goal cause I'm reachin' for mine
They used to d-do it out in the park
D-do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park[Scratched by Pete Rock]
"This is the place where stars are born"
"The Bridge, Queensbrigde"

[Poet]
Y'all niggas love to hear the stories again and again
Of how it all got started way back then
See it was Marly, MC Shan, the Juice Crew
Queensbridge, hip-hop land, those niggas blew (up)
Nobody said it started there
But some playa hater tried to end the party there
Niggas didn't care they burned it, put it in the air
I took it personal readied up for warfare
Shit, yeah, what?
But time passed by, shit died out
But niggas got paid off my hood no doubt
Now everybodies rhymin, other hoods start shinin
Thats ahight 'cuz the Bridge'll keep risin

[Scratched by Pete Rock]
"You love to hear the stories again and again
Of how it all got started way back when"
"The Bridge, Queensbridge"
"Screwball drops the illest shit"

[Poet]
And just when you thought things couldn't get betta
Nas dropped Illmatic and let'cha'll faggots have it
He brought the shine back, made the right contact
Had the whole world sayin "Hey dun, rewind that" (Rewind that)
Niggas from every hood felt the new vibe
The word spread quick, the Bridge is still live
My dun went gold, then he went platinum
My niggas Mobb Deep had the streets right afta him
OH MY GOD, shits off the hook now
Killing kids, in the Bridge carry rap books now
Another chapter about to dominate
I guess its just in our nature, Queensbridge gotta set it straight
We on some kamikaze shit, moving at a Cormega pace
Infamous Mobb up in this rap race
This is the place where stars are born
Im'a stay repin my hood until Im'a dead and gone

Cuts by Pete Rock

[Poet]
You still walkin through life like you was blind
Need you a lucy but you short one dime
Damn, thought about it, ten minutes later
Bumbed a cigarette going up in the elavator

[MC Shan]
Dead dreams, more than sold
You gotta to try and recieve ya goal
However you do it, however you may
Don't never listen to what nobody say, uhh
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should'a been steak (steak)
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walking through as you were blind
You should reach for your goal 'cuz I'm reaching for mine
You love to, you love to

Cuts and Scratches by Pete RockGangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in, there's no turnin back
Initiation, manhoods are tested
Do crime, you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line, cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him, you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you wanna be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Just a walk on the block, they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere, just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you wanna be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste

No turnin back [repeated]

Had many bad dreams, nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo, while you're sweepin the streets, does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action, they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You wanna live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died, so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste

Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another wasteMe and Marley Marl, we are resented, ya know?
Because of the beats and the rhymes we invented
To cold dis another's a thing that we love
So here's another one to get jealous of
Do it ya

Do it ya

MC's that I battled are the MC's I defeat
Now you say you took me out, now how that sound?
Do it ya

Once I'm done puttin heads to rest
I sit back and puff a spliff of buddha bless
See, in days of old mi rhyme went gold
The music, it wasn't recommended
Man used to sit on seat and tap out a beat
And went away feeling relieved
Hey ya
But soon after our rhyme is invented
And put together, it sound contented
And rhymin a-fi work
I tell you rhymin, yes it a-fi work
Bang-dang-dilli-dilli-dilli
MC's, dem like to bite the things you say
Others come along and like the beats you play
You know that's cold considered a dissin of work, ya know?
I don't deal with negativity and thing and thing
I'm the MC, and I'm also cool
Jacuzzi in my crib size of your pool
Sent di butler for my midnight treat
Rug so plush ya can't see ya feet
If ya come and visit if you choose
It's a must at the door that you leave your shoes
Don't obey and you'll have to go
Some didn't listen till my gun went bo!

Rock the house a little bit
Rub-a-dub

Michigan and Smiley
And di Yellowman
And MC Shan and Marley
Ya know

The house is packed every place I play
But let me tell ya bout this jam one day

]From the very first time I walked through the door
I see the people rub-a-dubbin on the floor
Played the wall, a man came past
Oh my God, dem puttin fire to glass!
I dipped, I bobbed, I weaved, I shook
I hear ya pump it one time and from there you're hooked
It make you sell your car, your house, your ring
Have you flying through the clouds and you don't have wings!
He passed it to me, I said, "No," him said, "Why?"
My boy jumped up and said, "I'll give it a try"
]From the very first time he ignited the flame
My homeboy wasn't actin insane
I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, "Let's go"
He looked at me and replied with, "No"
I said, "Fuck it," and left him there
The torch, the pipe, the base, the chair
I came back five days from then
To my surprise I seen my friend
To let you know what this thing does
He was sitting in the very same spot he was
I walked over, "Want more?" he said
Pipin hot my man dropped dead
His head hit the table, the pipe hit the floor
But I'll mention that di man won't base no more!
Bo!

Hey man, let me tell ya, man
True story, no bloodclot
???? when his head hit the floor, man
Everyone cried for the coroner
Some picked up di pipe and said
"Man, dem leave em on the floor just like he lay, ya know?"
Picked up dem crumb and put it in di pipe and fuckin pissed off, ya dig, man
Oh my God, bloodclot!
Man puttin fire to di glass thing, man
And say, "Scotty! Scotty! Where ya at, Scotty?"
To the transporter room, ya know?
"Beam me! Beam me!
Beam me, blood!
Beam me, bloodclot!"(Cut it nice)

[ VERSE 1 ]
It's been so long and I paid my dues
And with rhymes like these, yo, Shan can't lose
You won't believe the strange thought that ocurred to me
So intense, it absolutely startled me
I knew that I was buggin when I stopped walkin:
"I think that you should hear me, I'm your conscience talkin
If you don't wanna listen, hey, it ain't no thing
You rap for a living, but you wish you could sing
You think your life is complete, there's a lot that you're missing
You enjoy making music for the people to listen
Hip-hop is your life, by oath you've sworn
Now it's time to start the mission for which you were born
You've acquired a rep, now you're labelled a villain
But I don't really care, Shan'll always be chillin
That's why I'm tryin to say, that's just part of your style
You were (born to be) wild, wild"
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild

[ VERSE 2 ]
I couldn't forget, no matter how I tried
But my conscience just wouldn't let a day go by
All day long I watched and observed
No, I gotta be jokin, that's word to Herb
I can take a lickin and keep on smilin
Who needs a license to ill, I was born to be wildin
Rhymes sweeter than a premium vintage grape
]From the paper I knew it'd sound dope on tape
Never in a rush, I'm Cold Chillin'
And the next perpetrator I find, I'm killin
Just ask your boys how many heads I flew
And that's why I roll with the Juice Crew
That voice in my mind taught me one lesson
I was born to be wild, and only suckers be fessin
I knew I had a purpose since the days of a child
I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The meaning of 'wild' is not screaming and yelling
It's 'bout showing and proving and not showing and telling
All you counterfeit rappers, you might as well quit
You'll never hear me say I'm bad, bein wild is the shit
Rap symbol, and never been defeated yet
If rap is a crime, how much time I get?
The best impersonator couldn't copy my style
And even if he did, you know what I'd do, I'll -
As a matter of fact, it's what I already did
I pulled out a rhyme and cold blasted his lip
Most opponents get on, they're guilty as tried
They're diggin and stripped of whole manhood and pride
Don't be brave and save yourself half of the bill
You can't chop me with a saw cause your ass should chill
When they're slippin on the cuts I gracefully smile
Cause I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

(Cut it nice)

(Get ready to get busy)

[ VERSE 4 ]
Born to be wild, I'm takin command
While you're performin people screamin out: "We want Shan!"
I'm colder than ice and hot as a flame
And my rhymes are always clever, but they're never the same
What's wrong with your girl? Somebody ought to stop her
For bein in the presence of a low-life rapper
This rhymin was pressed as a special edition
I was born to be wild and you're the one on a mission
Allow me to say that I weaken resistance
Makin examples just to prove my mortal existence
Born to be wild means a prototype
And the roar of the crowd increases the hype
You have to be bold to try and steal my rhyme
Or even to dis cause you think that I'm
A sucker, a softie, or even a child
But I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

(Get ready to get busy)(feat. M.C. Shan)

[Verse 1]
It's Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass it
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, give me my freedom

[Verse 2]
I wanna break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim it theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I dont need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom

[Verse 3]
I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my freedom

[Verse 4]
We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down then the beats would catch it
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom[Verse 1]
It's Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite

To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains

You would swear that every line of my rhyme was thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, give me my freedom

[Verse 2]
I wanna break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim it theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I dont need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom

[Verse 3]
I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my freedom

[Verse 4]
We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down then the beats would catch it
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom[ VERSE 1 ]
M.C. Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass this
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was Thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy - give me my freedom
