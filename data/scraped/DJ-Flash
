[Verse 1: Chaundon]

Songs in the key of life I play the notes well
Never sang the county blues that’s not what I’m trying to sell
I record love and happiness prosperity as well
Radio will never play the real life stories that I tell
Hello Bronx hello Harlem hello Brooklyn hello Queens
Hello Staten Island 5 borough be wildin’ on the scene
Aspire to make cream without triple beam dreams
Entertainment ain't the only way to make it nah mean
You can be a Dr. King with Coretta as your queen
We ain't reach the promise land here’s a chance for you to lead
Got babies having babies and there ain't no baby sitters
Corporate bail out but ain't nobody trying to save my (expletive)
Poor folks going through it where the president at?
So much money for the wars where them presidents at?
In this climate of rap only a few droppin’ gems
First chapter first one written in these ghetto hymns

[Verse 2: YC The Cynic]

Black man in America the Pangea
Native land inheriter
Land of the free home of the slaves the paradox
Pondering why pandora’s box was there unlocked watch
W.E.B breathe air in your beats and air it out
So honest even psychologist sit in there in shock
And awe taking your all hittin’ hearts
I see your guard if you hittin’ at all takin it off feel me
Feel me? It’s too much to leave in the wind
There’s a kid that’s scared to follow his dream I’m speaking to him
Or her I prefer to be heard then be a prophet deterred
Because of profits deferred I’m trying to win I'mma work
To see you having the happiness you deserve
Prosperity is encouraged I’m grading you on a curve
I bend to see you win from a loss
And then my only reward would be you passing this on take off

(DJ Flash scratches, prosperity is encouraged)[Verse 1: Chaundon]

Back in the streets of New York where I grew up
Corners where I threw up, alcoholic beverages
Listening to Hip Hop influenced by the messages
Anything less than this is totally irrelavent
Staircase rap I continue to climb
And I look good doing it so girls feel the rhyme
Going over their heads twice kind of like double dutch
But they jump to it showing that they all fuck with us
I know the ledge cuz I'm standing on the edge of it
Can't handle the pressure they're on some Heath Ledger shit
I'm strong enough to hold the weight of my genius
And not dumb it down just to lighten the load
Cuz some of yall ain't shit like an empty commode
Type to sell your soul just to say you're 'bout to explode
I challenge all of you to win with out compromising
And get it on your own merit that would be surprising

[Hook by DJ Flash]
Back in the streets of New York
The Skyline bluer than the rocks on my watch
The architect, Chaundon
Jam like a tek with correct techniques
Back in the streets of New York
The Skyline bluer than the rocks on my watch
The architect, Chaundon
I dominate break loops
To light up the sky

[Verse 2: Chaundon]

Rooftop rap architecture of the skyline
I know its inanimate the hands say its my time
Mastered my destiny answer to who?
Not only are they small they're like ants in my view
Birds of a feather don't necessary fly
You penguins get envious when I kiss the sky
Napoleon complex because I think bigger
Nah, just convinced I ain't your ordinary nigga
My mind transcends borders
What I need a passport for? territories open doors for us
The vocab is flawless and enormous
I can see the world for what it is clearer than the eye of Horus
Yes I gotta have it, its written in the tablet
The apple gave me wisdom ignorant thinking it's magic
My soul is ILLMATIC the flesh can't contain it
Not half of anything I am pure bred amazing
