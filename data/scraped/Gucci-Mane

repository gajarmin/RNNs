Prayin' to the trap god that this boss don't get knocked, hopefully

When a brick was twenty-six, it got me goddamn rich

Boy if you ain't gettin' no money, go hit a goddamn lick

It's ZooWap from the bando, boy this ain't what you want
Rubber grip on my handle, I crush your ass for fun
Not anywhere I can't go, I pull up where I want
Anything is on the counter it's like Fetty tryna stunt
Everyone in my camp go, four others got a gun
Don't you think that we're lackin', the chopper's in the trunk
Hear that shit when it's blastin', I love the way it dump
Used to sleep in the trap house, wake up next to my gun

Sippin' coladas, smokin' ganja, he's a heavy smoker
I started right here in the city, they call me a local
I rob you blind and burn the money like the fuckin' Joker
And if you don't believe me, ask them hoes at Strokers
So much money in the air, can't even see the sofa
So much kush smoke in the air, I can't help but smell the odor
They say I cook so many deuces my arm need a motor
Half a pint in the Mountain Dew, now that's a dirty soda
And I sell so many chickens, think I work for Kroger

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'm flexin', countin' gualas, parkin' Lexus, I don't ride em
Bad yellow bitch, passin' unless she a rider
She is down to ride with me and she gone hold my Glock
And she see an opp, I tell her pop her and she gone pop off
All us like 2Pac, Notorious, bitch I'm like Big Papa
If I see an opp, I spot him, shot him, bitch I got him
Drive through, in and out, I throw 'em up, Benihanas
Ridin', hemi, semi on me, catch his ass, semi on 'em

My Ruger hold a thirty, you can hold a fuckin' chorus
That's 80 shots at your face, better be good at duckin' bullets
Pull up in that Lord car, that's that shit them hoes adore
I pull up to the club and tell a bitch to hop aboard
Baby I'm a king, I know I am not a Lord
But I'm Almighty So' and that's that shit that I send shottas for
I'm smokin' paraphernalia with a Glock on tours
Make that bitch sing a melody, you get lot's of chords

In love with the money, I ain't never letting go

[Hook]

These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em

I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons (Gucci)

[Hook]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

AK hit your dog, and you can't bring Old Yeller back
Yep Gucci bang up eighty thousand: that's a yellow safe
Yello, holmes. Mellow, holmes. You know you a scary-cat
No sleep for two days, so my pupils look yellow
Five flights, six shows, quarter-million on my schedule
Bangladesh and Gucci Mane – niggas know they in trouble
Green ice, red light. Caution: Gucci rock yellow

[Hook][Intro: Gucci Mane]

Fuck boys know I keep that extendo

[Hook: Gucci Mane x2]
Trap house 3 got a K with me

Trappin' off a pack, I'm trap house trap

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You know I got me an agenda
Break that thing up in my blender
Got a warrant, no surrender
Sub-machine with that extender
I came up on a pissy mattress
I got more money then all these rappers
Tried to hit me up in traffic
But I had to work my magic
I'm riding round with my lieutenant
I let 'em count it and I spend it
Bitches come after my business
Catching bodies in these trenches

[Hook: Gucci Mane x2]
Trap House 3[Produced by Kane Beatz]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these niggas!
I'mma spare everything but these niggas
I flip the gun and gun-butt these niggas
Take the knife off the AK and cut these niggas
And fuck these bitches
I swear I care about everything but these bitches
I don’t care, I "so what?" these bitches
And I put Young Mula, baby, way above these bitches
If it ain’t broke, don’t break it
And if he ain’t shook, I’m gonna shake him
Hope I don’t look weak
Cause when a wolf cry wolf, you still see that wolf's teeth, mothafucka
Futuristic hand gun
If you act foul, you get two shots and one
I'm at your face like Lancôme
You niggas softer than Roseanne's son
Hey, you cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fucking the world and giving the universe my damn tongue
Crazy motherfucker? I am one
But the crazy thing is, I began one
All white bricks, I’m straight like it’s jumping back to 36 nigga
Big house, long hallways, got 10 bathrooms, I could shit all day, nigga

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And we don’t want no problems
Ok, you’re a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeah, and Kane on the beat

Ughh, I pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh huh, and we be steady mobbin'
Oh Kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
What the fuck is up? It’s Gucci Mane the G
Ask Tity Boi, no pity boy, this scar city the city boy
So icy, so no Nike boy, just Gucci, Louis, Prada, 'scuse me
"Gucci Mane keep shittin on me, why that boy keep buyin jewellery?"
East Atlanta cockin hammers
Bandannas on car antennas
No we do not talk to strangers
Just cut off these niggas' fingers
Gucci’s armed and dangerous, cocaine, codeine and angel dust
This AK-47 will hitchya everywhere from the ankle up
Gun same size as Nia Long, clip long as a Pringles can
.45 Desert Eagle on me, you’ll think I'm a Eagles fan
Toni Braxton sniper rifle, make you never breathe again
Fuck that nigga, kill that nigga, bring him back, kill him again (Gucci!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the money is the motive
Fuck with the money, it get ugly as Coyote
Ok, I’m reloaded
Better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright, I don’t even need light
I’m with a model broad, she don’t even eat rice
But would you believe that she eat dykes?
And she asked me for a pitcher, so I gave her 3 strikes
Yeah, I-I’m the man around this motherfucker
I’m so hot you probably catch a tan around this motherfucker
This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah I said game, but I ain’t playing around this motherfucker
Yeah, I’m the best to ever do it, bitch
And you’re the best at never doing shit
If you the shit, then I am sewer-rich
Try me and I’ll have your people reading eulogies
I swear you can’t fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl and make her nut for me
Then slut for me, then kill for me, then steal for me
And of course it’ll be your cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to your ass

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, man suck my clip
Swallow my bullets, and don’t you spit
Uhh! I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I’m all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this?
I will make the most of this
'F' is for fer-o-cious
Murder your associates
The top is so appropriate
This is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for your girlfriend to wobble on

[Hook][Intro: Chief Keef]
Hello?
Yeah?

Parking brand new car
Ballin' hard, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

Thirty G's a verse from me
Your baby daddy work for me

And I think about my family constantly

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Your friend constantly h
Hitting my phone! Constantly
These feds steady tapping my phone

Continue to hate on me
I swear that shit don’t bother me, aye!
Smoke OG no bubbly
And I smoke that shit constantly
I fuck hoes constantly and I rock shows constantly
Baby why you joking, I don’t play?
These niggas jokes I'm out of space and I'm a spade
Every time she whine, I'm like, “OK?”
I don’t want to hear that shit, not today
Let me check my watch

Ain't no time to waste
Got some cake to make
She want to see me

There's a white girl in town, Name is Cocaine
There's some dirty birds in town: Gucci Mane & Waka Flame
We fly in, I’m buyin, say you got more birds? You lyin
You trying and lying, you boys ain't supplying
I pitch like Nolan Ryan, got cocaína frying
My partners stick up kids, duct tape what they gon' tie in
In the bushes they lying in all night, that's my word
By the end of the morning, they left with them birds
Gone off that purp, I'm slurring my words
I swerved in my Benz, bang my Forgi's on the curb
The lean, the herb, pay me like the First
You cross Brick Squad, get hurt I got work
Gucci!

[ Hook: Waka Flocka Flame ]
My homeboys will get you, Pay you on the Thirty-Third
Two pints of lean will have me slurring on my words

Two pints of lean will have me slurring on my words

Triple red drop, (?) through the parking lot

Lay your ass down if you do too much bragging
Three case, Four Glocks, nigga, that's swagging
Uh!

Robbin' every nigga that Hit Squad, Blood, or Piru

[Hook]

[ Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame ]
Half a million dollar jewelry like, "Fuck that bird!"
Niggas screaming they want beef, I'm like, "Roger that!"
My album didn't sell, so I'm laying niggas down
Shooting every nigga that burps, sneeze, or fucking frown

[ Verse 4: YG Hootie ]
40 carats on my brac-elet, my Polo black
Niggas talking like they won't be not wanting that
7 grams in this Swisher, I'm gon' solo that
Riding around with my strap like, "Where they at?"
All these rap niggas hold us on my Philly hat
You will never be a legend like the Gucci Man
You will never be turnt up like my partner Flock
You niggas hoes I run your block when them choppers chop
Hooter

[Hook][Intro]
I'm charging 16 fever, 16 fever, nigga my price cheaper, 16 fever

Hoes ride dicks, dog, but I ride Beemers
A square rectangle cost 16 fever

[Verse 1]
16 5-0, there go 5-0
I'm up 2-5 but I need 4 more
I got uncles blowing bundles, mine do numbers while I drive lambo
Off-white yayo, digital scale
Fishscale sending my pigeons by mail
Bring in my drain folks, I just bring me that caine, folks
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bricks: can't keep em
16 fever, Beemer-speakers, geek-a-meters
Misdemeanors, several subpeonas
See, I'm gonna drink up cause we just linked up
The squad been teamed up, we cutting off fingers
It's 16 fever and that's since april
My Corvette paid for, my old-school paid for
The hummer roll up? That means you assed out
And you didn't cash out, see this my traphouse
I slam fiends backs out, we push white sacks out
See this my traphouse, I slam fiends backs out
We push white sacks out, them backs get pushed out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm scraping the bowl up, I'm whipping up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet! Don't eat it, you smoke it
Your options are open: you even can snort it!
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it
Say "you can't afford it". Yo, I can't ignore it
Well go call them dope boys, you know you feel boring!
You know that you fiending, you know that you need it
It's Gucci, I'm greedy. My niggas stay eating[Hook]
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I came up in the struggle, I had holes all in my shoes
Now my price so cheap that people think my connect from Peru
And my dope so fuckin' good, you can put 4 on a 2
So your deuce turned to six,  so an extra four for you
It's so clean, a Junky's dream, she thinks it's 1982
Jesús pull up, I pull up, then we pop trunks and switcharoo
Got that Tec-9 with the coo
And it might knock you out your shoes, Gucci

[Verse 1]
Back to the wall, back to the mall
Wednesday night, I'm back to Kamal's
Bussin' a blunt so I'm breaking the law
Run up on me and I'm breaking ya' jaw
Flippin' the raw, choppin' the car
Put my red bottles  on top of the bar
I'm dropping my top and she dropping her top
Let my roof back and she took off her bra
I raised these niggas like I was they pa'
Give me respect like I'm fuckin' ya' ma'
Brick Squad Records, you know who we are
Check it, respect it or take me to war
Slap you, dare you to take me to court
Take it in blood but I ain't takin' it short
Ain't gettin' paid then what is the point?
If you want mo' then come fuck with ya' boy
Million in cash, in back of the truck
Take your goons, your dick in the dust
Your hitman be whackin' for us
Got headless bodies in back of the bus
I talk big shit but I'm backin' it up
You stakin' and trappin', ain't trappin' for us?
Think you got us well I'll cut off your nuts and I run them through your body in back of the blood

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm in Sun Valley in a dark alley
Tryna' keep balance in my New Balance
Competitions ain't no challenge, fourteen and I'm so managed
My migo friend but can't speak Spanish
Pressure on but I don't panic
Goin' H.A.M like a ham sandwich
Be calm, I know how to handle it
I vanish in a Vanquish, 50 thousand on these Sam Smith's
Hunnid grand in my pant's, countin' money's romantic
Keep a hunnid, can't handle it, they charge 10 dollars for dances
So I make her dance till' her legs cramp and the bitch said she can't stand me
There's so many fake asses, fuck it, I'mma just smash it
I can't tell if it's fake a or real no more, I think I need glasses
Anti-social, I'mma smoker, so I roll one and don't pass it
Call me Big Unc' when you see me cause I used to give dope to your daddy

[Hook][Hook:]

Candy coated black things sittin on them 40 O's
24 towers, 8 bricks of powder, 10 bales of dro

[Verse One]
Nigga I'm one-seven-five wet, movin like Deebo
Boxcutter like a nigga work at Home Depot
Rep for my people, a big Desert Eagle
Shootin' at your bucket like a Marbury free throw
Bitches get nothin, zilch I mean zero
Tommy gun sprayed at them niggas playin' hero
Niggas in the hood don't peep through no peephole
Cameras and motion scanners, try to creep ho
Most of us iced out, some don't even rock jewels
They in the club for a purpose, and that's to bang the tool
Street smart, I'm far from that college dude
Love gettin good brains, bitches give me knowledge fool
It don't take much, a little weed and the dutch
Couple sips of that Remy, now she wanna fuck
Hoes see a nigga chain swingin wanna touch
Rocks used to be cubed up, now my shit is crushed

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
My pack came in, I want seventeen-five for 'em

Catch me in the 6 a nigga right where the shoals be

Haters get found in the Okefenokee

I'm not a role model young nigga cook that work

[Hook] - to fade[Verse One]
Yeah, six figure, one top, two seats, four wheels

My goon's Gucci, got a whole lot of guns
Top back, switching lanes, bet that bitch gon' give me brain
If she ain't, I ain't tripping, bitch, get out in the turning lane
White on white Lexus, that's my fish scale movement
When I was in the hood, I was cocaine moving
S550 like a Maybach's moving
I was an American Gangster before the movie
Yo Gotti, one nigger, two heaters
Purple by the litre, in my two seater

[Hook]
Two seats, it's two seats, one girl, and one me, yeah

My Lowenhart's is tearing up the asphalt, pulled up in a Jaguar
'08 Porsche Carerra, Testarossa, Murciélago, '08 this McLaren
Ferrari Spider, apple cider, call that bitch the fast one
Off white vet with the off white diamond, pulled up to the light, and stop
The rims be spinning backwards, two door Viper with rally stripes
Now she stops in traffic, A coupé on standing rims in '08
Boy, you need your ass kicked, the Viper come's with two seats
I call that bitch the cat truck, police tried to whip me over
So I drove it faster, six racks worth of hundreds on me
I don't keep a gas card, prototype twos-eat Camaro, East Atlanta NASCAR

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Guns on deck, fifty round my neck, one hundred's in the car
I die for my respect, car jack who, gone rob who, gone slap who
Bitch, I'll kill you, oh oh, them boys a fool, doing donut's in the Lam

End of the night was pulling on her hair I really
Don't care the games unfair Gucci Mane La Flare
Who gives a care about niggas over there?
Shawty got a pear: apple with a gap

I'm Mr. Get-Her-Dere, take your underwear, you fuckin
With a boss no need for fuckin with a square

[Hook]
I light the weed up, and hit it two times

[Verse 2 - Wiz khalifa]
Oh I got a joint burnin here real slow

Crib in L.A I flew her to the south with me
You niggas wanna be players? Well I can show you how to be

Another causality I kill every beat, I'm smokin on celery
Only fuck with papers a gang of Taylors on every feet

Yo bitch want me to save her u betta tame her of get a leash

Big up to Jeezy but the 12 disciples they betrayed Jesus
RIP to MLK he was a born leader
Malcolm X man dat there, them my damn people
Its a revolution second graders smokin' reefer
And killin' people, god deliver me from evil
My momma told me in the county jail in visitation
That shes not sad I took her ? shes happy that I made it
I buried the trash they threw at me and know its my buried treasure
And every hurdle in life I leap, it make me more successful

[Hook]
Life so stressful, niggas they gone test ya
So Icey and you can't make a diamond without pressure
Just to wake up and breath, man I'm blessedful
I used to pay my momma rent with the extras
Dope man, bitch want a bag I got extras
Don't measure lean pour up and don't measure
Dope man burry a mill, its buried treasure
Extra extra read about it, bitch I'm in the paper

[Verse 2]

Fuck the CEO, Fuck the artist and the goon's too
Smell's like pussy over there, nigga fuck you

Verse 1:
Money keep coming in so I ain't even worried
I'm richer than your Daddy baby and I ain't even thirty
A nigga made a diss song and I ain't even heard it
Never mention homie's name cause he ain't worth it
Thought about a charm cause I felt like splurging
Showed my jeweler love then he made the chain perfect
Man, I'm one take perfect, VVS diamond chains, don't they look pretty
And I don't leave with the ones, Nigga thats petty
This pretty red girl said fuck it I'm quitting
Dance till your white big toe start splitting
I'm hood rich, stupid rich, and I ain?t bullshitting
A thousand carats on baby I ain?t bullshitting
Eight grand gone I ain?t been ten minutes
Baby gimme two minutes, twenty more coming
Later do eighty-four hundred I?m throwing
Dually truck, Hummer truck, my truck game stupid
Just like Lo I pull up in something foolish
Red diamond chain but it sure ain?t cupid
I came along way from that ?84 Buick

Fuck the CEO, fuck the artist and his goons too
Smell like pussy over there, nigga fuck you

Verse 2:

Dirty shoes shawty first you need to change your shoestrings

Gucci got a pump and I bought that thing for one thing
Smoked nine joints now the nigga think he John Wayne
Yea I think I'm bad cuz I got a stupid fight game
One punch shawty I will make you see the light mayne
Stomp-out shawty I will make you read my Jordans

Damn it feel good ridin round my hood iced out[Intro]

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]

How the fuck you ballin' with a car note? (How the fuck?)
I’m in the trap, real shit where the felons go (Squad)
Cury never had a job, he always used a bowl (Whip it)
Them youngin’s run up in your house what it's hitting for
No mask just to let you know who did it ho
I’m from Riverdale, all I know is get it in (Riverdale)
I got weed, I got mollies, what you tryin' to spend?

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
50k for a show and my niggas sellin’ swag
She's a red bottom bitch Versace shirt, Birkin bag
I'm a get money nigga, don’t use the card, or keep a tab
Before I leave my fucking house, grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the bands I be playing with a check, uh! (x4)

[Verse 2 : Waka Flocka]
My foreign car painted flat black (Turn Up)
My girl hopped out ass fat (Damn)
Paparazzi keep flashing pictures (Flocka)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane I’m the fucking man, pocket full of Xan
Put them grands on a nigga Grands, change a nigga plans
If you steal or don't keep it real, chopping off your hands
A million grams, I’mma try to cram in a minivan
Say he hard and he goin’ ham, I don’t give a damn
Say he broke and a hundred million just went through his hand
I don’t cherish it, I’m flying terrorists in from Sudan
If you thinking you gon’ take my grams I’mma change your plan
You in a jam pussy nigga, but I just came from Japan
I'm making fans off of growing weed super duper strand
I heard the fam', they jumped on your man and your nigga ran
Flockaveli you know that’s my man, call Decatur Dan

[Hook][Intro]
3pm
A deal is going down on the wrong side of the tracks
In Atlanta, Georgia
This nigga robbed me
Dope boys, I ain’t finna run to the police too fast

[Hook]
Man a nigga just broke in my spot
That’s like a nigga taking dope out my pot
He stole some money and some weed and a watch
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock
Fuck talking, I just want to hear shots
I ain’t asking if you did or did not
Imma run that nigga off of this block
I need the nigga dead by 5 O’clock

[Verse 1]
I’m a brick squad soldier, I thought I told ya
Mister ice cream man, I’m selling boulders
I lost a load, New Mexico, they fucking pulled her over
And she’ll never fuck me over nigga, all my bitches soldiers
Crush and roll soldier, boulder crest soldier
And I told my bitch to quit me cause I never will propose to her
And as I get older my jewelry get colder
But why the task force had to put me in the folder
Rest in peace to Soldier Slim, that boy there was a soldier
Rest in peace to Pac and Big, cause them niggas was soldiers
They gave my partner 60 years, but he don’t think it’s over
I got money for his appearance cause we just want some closure

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
These other niggasplay for keeps, the day I kill your ass for sneaking money
A teacher makes like 30 thousand a year, I make that daily homie
I’m mister keep a big old pistol cause these niggas be hating on me
You got to get this pistol in your name, that be my lady baby
Grab me up that brand new FN, get you a 3.80 baby
Trapping like it’s 1980, but I don’t really fuck with Reagan
I’m smoking kush in Central Station, drinking one with some of my Haitians
Bitches say I’m two faced but these pussy niggas be scared to face it
Put a split on top of split then y’all niggas run in your shit
Rocking diamonds, so much money, can’t even wear a money clip
I tell them niggas don’t when [?] or get pistol whipped
Trap a [?] like [?] and that’s how you got your uncle clipped

[Hook]Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch talkin' bout burr
I'm talkin' homegirl be lookin' like she just stepped outta a magazine
I'm talkin' niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious

[Gucci Mane]
Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

[Refrain]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

[Yo Gotti]
It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realist nigga walkin'
And this the remix and still I'm out here lookin'
For a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her
With a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

[Refrain]

[Trina]
See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick
She been strugglin' for hers
From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like Coming To America
All my Louis luggage
You see my bag, how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin' on to E-Trade

[Refrain]

[Nicki Minaj]
I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' fuck 'em, with a dildo sign
Five, little Mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen
Barbie
I'm hot I think its time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin' and leavin'
Young Money, red flag, no more auditions
Ask Lil' Wayne who the five-star bitch isReal talk nigga

Word on the street that I dont like jeezy

Niggas hatin on me so I can't stay focused

[Verse 3]

Now what would you do if a nigga tried you

And some niggas came through would you run like a chick or stand like man
Nigga tell me when you piss do you sit or do you stand

77 birds in a trash can
My cooker cook the dope with his left hand
Six hundred bales in the caravan
Do the math thats a whole lot of free bands

[Young Scooter]
I know i say some shit you wouldn't understand
Just to walk in my shoes you need a million cash
Plus you need another hundred thousand just for gas
All that road running, trapping for them free bands
Salute my partner pimp, thats my right hand
Look at all the shit we did you'd get a hundred years
My plug said i made 'em like 200 mills
Introduced him to that jug and gave me stupid deals
How you selling kilos and going back broke
Can’t worry about a bitch when you got kilos
You a real nigga don’t disrespect the dough
I got bricks in every trash can in mexico

[Gucci Mane]
We bought a split so I couldn't afford a free skeet
They say I'm winning like a nigga got a cheat sheet
Damn, got a girl with them squares .. I call her KiKi
And have them hundreds face up when you meet me
When i hit it make it come back hard as concrete
You p**sy nigga cross the street i cross the country
And if you suck a glass dick you's a junkey
I got a fetish yeah i love counting money ..
77 birds in the trash can
Sold so many singles I should be on SoundScan
Sold so many deuces I should be on a wanted poster
And I whip so much dope my arm need a motor
[Hook]

And damn that boy can sho' drank
Her pussy sweet
Her pussy kiwi
I poured it on her hole
I told her ride me like it's PE
And suck it until she can't
Got her smoking on that good weed
Lean on a Swisher Sweet
I'd rather have a C.N.O.T.E than a Swiss Beat
$50,000 for a C.N.O.T.E beat
He looked out for me
Shout out to my Mexican
Cuz he looked out for me

[Hook]
Actavis, you are love (Im on that purple drank)
Actavis, you are love (Huh, what, what)
Actavis, you are love (Pour up, turn up)

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane stay leaning holmes
Holmes what you leanin' on?
Double cup my styrofoam
My friends say I treat them wrong
Wrong, cuz' I ain't drinking with them
Strong, I'm not Chiefin' with them
Long, me and Waka pimpin'
Scooter and we really pimpin'
Michael Jordan, Scotty Pippen
We done fucked a lot of women
We done robbed a lot of Bentlys
We done partied several citys
All my niggas drinking PTs
We a fool with lean
All my niggas drink actavis
With no gwap or tiss
Gone off promethazine
Every drug from A to Z
I'm in the club with three PTs
I'm JFK
I'm MLk
My top drop back
My bitches gay
All blue rollie
Ocean face
On Ocean Drive
Two Ocean Sprays
And im so high
I fly away

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Crusing round on Forgiatos
Sippin' mud can't feel my face
Duck me, fuck me good
I gave her C.N.O.T.E
"Bitch get out my face"
In a straight A
Keep me staight aye
Charger on a highway race
And rockin' loafers with no laces
Think im Neo from the Matrix
Turbulence got me going crazy
Throwing Coca-Cola on this lady
I'm sorry baby, I'm high baby
Just poured a pint in apple cranberry
Wasting shit on my Burberry
Molly got me feeling hurl ill
10 karats in my girl ear
Real diamonds like hell yeah
Expensive linen, rockin' cashmere
Still sippin' I got it bad baby
I'm on this shit like a crack addict
Jaguar I had to matt black it
Our city
Back cam
Bad bitches don't wear panties
Easy access grammy, grammy, I'm scandalous

[Hook]

[Bridge][Intro:]
See this swagger, that real boss music you know
I mean you know you had a...
You gotta turn up this shit a lil louder, you feel me?
Gucci Mane
Scream!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I ain't never want a Grammy, I ain't never been a nominee
Bees in my Hummer V, 30 grand for one of these
I don't like these pussy ass niggas just like Chief Keef
Bon appétit, when I eat, nigga feast feast
Bishop think, capish pish
Keep her on a short leash
Half people deceased
Cause they know they dead meat
Toes out, top off, grinding my freak G
You came to the game but you way in the cheap seat

[Hook: T-Pain]
I swear they don't want me to succeed
But I'm not letting them leave until I stop em from breathing
I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you down
Man, it will make a nigga really wanna act up
Cause I'm a do what I'm a do, in my new Cadillac truck
What about you? But I ain't fucking 'round
Don't let 'em get you down

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got killers on my payroll, moving when I say so
These hoes don't really love me, they just love I got a bank roll
My plug he just keep sending blow
He ain't never said no
He mixing on the hat they broke
And I can't understand folk
I'm talkin to you, pussy ass nigga – you'd better listen
Stepped, is that so hard? With that pistol he paid attention
Jump out with them K's, start hittin' cause they were snitchin
Tell the ambulance hey no need to rush cause shorty twistin'

[Hook][Intro : Gucci Mane]
I know why they fuck with Bricksquad
Real recognize real, it's Gucc'

[Hook : Quavo]
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, 'aight
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, I'm straight
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, fuck nigga
I'mma get mine by any means

[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Don't worry about me I'm 'aight
My pockets on take off finna take flight
My momma told me go and get that cheese
Gotta help the family put the shit on me
Shit get real out here in the jungle
Ion' trust a young nigga, I'm just tryin' to stay humble
Nigga wanna hit my phone bout some marijuana
I wrap the pack up and get that shit to Tijuana
My daddy died, I miss you
But still nigga I'm 'aight (Aight?)
You niggas is fake, you niggas is snake
You go left, I'mma go right
When Gucci called my manager, that night it changed my life
Now all my hard work paid on, Young Quavo I earned my stripes
Gone!

[Hook : Quavo]

[Verse 2 : Gucci Mane]
Every time you see me nigga I be with a thousand
Young niggas that's wildin', all my dogs be growlin'
All my wolves be howlin', all my shooters prowlin'
Goin' hard in the paint on these pussy ass niggas
Cause a fuck nigga tried to foul me
Bitch get the fuck from 'round me
Crown me cause I'm royalty
All my niggas loyal to me, all my hoes they spoil me
You are not a plug if you don't charge what I'm charging
Caught a murder charge, thanks to God I beat the charges
Shooters jumpin' out the van when the van park
In East Atlanta my house is a landmark
Your favorite rapper in the Gucci Mane fan club
I had to run out just to run my bands up
You wanna be a CEO then get your grands up
You wanna jack me you better change your plan up
Broke into my house and they keep bringin' your name up
Decapitation now you can't put your hands up
It's Gucc'

[Hook : Quavo]
