[Intro: Trip Lee]
Yessir
Gawvi, get 'em
Why we do it?
Why we do it?

[Hook: Gawvi]

Got a cabin in manolo (nolo) manolo (nolo) manolo (nolo) manolo
Got a cabin in manolo (nolo) manolo (nolo) manolo (nolo) manolo
Got a cabin in manolo

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Trying to tell them boys

Cuz I keep one in my car and I got two at home
They diff'rent kinds but they do the same thing
Double-edged double-barrel (bang bang) Yessuh
I’m out here facin' dragons, I ain’t on my mind (bang bang)
They comin' for my soul so it’s bout that time (bang bang)
Them lies they trying to kill me if you don't believe me
I don't care, I don't care
I can't take it easy
I’m flippin the page, I’m trigga happy a clip in the gauge
Clickin and hittin the stage, hit you with truth thats in every phrase
He cut me deep I'm

Come alive again, uh huh
Manolo mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Manolo, manolo?

And I ain't gotta say no more, I'm gonna click click bang and the thing gon' blow
Red Letters like a red dot on yo door (yep yep yep yep yep)
All yall gone with a dash on the backseat
That's me with a clip full of black ink
Ima hit yall with it till I split yall with it (man down man down)
Had a bad week, bad week (man down, man down)

[Hook]

[Outro: Trip Lee]
I be a sheep I'm a dummy
Sometimes it ain't even funny
Them lies are sicker than poison pours while the truth that is sweeter than honey
And we know that He got us
He is with us can't block us; Ibaka
His word is my weapon
It's going Brrrr-aaat!

[Hook: Perfekt]
Sideways, came in this thing sideways
Get turnt, get lit sideways
Haters looking at me sideways
Sideways, sideways
I ain't slept in like 9 days
Heard they be talking sideways
Leaning in this thing sideways, sideways

[Verse 1: KB]
They wanna see your boy Kevin wear (down)
Hope the worst when they tell me go and break a leg
This music with or without me boy
Still gonna be intersecting circles like an Audi boy
Feelin' like I'm ballin' boy
Reading James can't let my heart harden boy
Don't need a side chick the main dish a problem boy
I be turning down girls like the volume boy
Do what we wanna do
Truth and the fruit, who really wanna juice
Move with a humble few these dudes who befuddle you
Derek Jeter boy, we cool being number 2
Them sons of the Father
Beast all four quarters won't change for a dollar
I put it on my momma
I ain't got no worries like hakuna matata

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KB]
The Lion King said D-I-E
Then brought us back to life like a EMT
No Biggie to me that you could do it B-I-G
'Till you and God align like a DMV
You rappers are neon green
Yukon Denalis, wanna be G MC's
But overdose on Christ see a G OD
G-O-D, that's what you see on me, now turn up
They know when we pull up
Where they working them traps like a pull up
So we bringin' 'em trap and a full cup
The full cup of water that's livin'
They don't know what to do with us
Degree in theology, raps for a livin'
Black man in first class that is reading the scriptures
I put my tray table up
Smile, why they lookin' sideways?

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Ooh, I promise you, you better come tell 'em, tell 'em
I ain't the one, I never was, I never will be
Somebody better come get 'em
I wonder what got in they head
Wonder what got in they mind (mind)
They got me mixed up, messed up
Click, hold on it's somebody on the line
Hello, uh, I ain't tryin' to build CHH
I'm in my own lane but they like he ain't safe
They rappin' in a bubble can't nobody see they face
I ain't worried 'bout a genre, the street ain't safe
I know some people out there probably envy my space
But envy is empty, come see my face
Full of scars, full of pain
I don't see much grace
Street Fighter, Ryu, catchin' heat all day, I'm good
And lately I've been hangin' in the hood
Everybody lookin' like, what?
You for the people, you pushin' back evil
Not just in the steeple, you out in the woods
Where the lions and the wolves at
Still waters run deep, but my crew run deeper
We already died we ain't scared of the reaper
We are too alive we don't fear what you're speaking
Seeing sideways, eyesight crooked
You ain't never seen us cause you ain't lookin'
And if I say Jesus, everybody start bookin'
Get out the kitchen when I'm cookin'
Pot sideways, whippin' that, whippin' that bass
That's what they wanna hear us say
Until we all get caught selling twenty dollar rocks
And we're just another slave of the state
Seeing sideways!

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1]
Waking up knowing there's a reason
All my dreams come alive
Life is for living with You
I've made my decision

[Verse 2]
You lift me up, fill my eyes with wonder
Forever young in Your love
This freedom's untainted with You
No moment is wasted

[Pre-Chorus]
See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turns to colour all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found

[Chorus]
This is living now (2x)

[Verse 3]
You lead the way, God You're right beside me
In Your love I'm complete
There's nothing like living with You
This life You created I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turn to color all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found

[Chorus]
This is living now (2x)
You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more

[Hook: Lecrae]
Maybe I ain't really know what living is
Is it love if it was am I living it?
Do I live in it? So astounding
Love is an ocean you can drown me
The sweet embrace the lovely taste
I taste and see I'm under Grace
The place to be
It means I don't ever need an umbrella
I'm cool in the cold and the hot weather
Whether or never I ever understand
I'm a man in the hands of great plans
I stand with faith in a life I never known or touched
It's still outside my clutch but
I'm like what's to dream of and what's to hope in
What's to die for and live to no end
This is living
The life I've been given's a gift
If I’m gonna live it I’m gonna live it to death!
So what's to dream of and what's to hope in
What's to die for and live to no end
This is living
The life I've been given's a gift
If I’m gonna live it I’m gonna live it to death!

[Chorus]
This is living now (2x)
You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more[Verse 1]
Keep me in my timezone when my mind's gone
When I'm flying home
And I'm stressed out and I'm tempted to get that styrofoam
And go pour it up, but you know what's up
And you know that ain't gone solve nothing
I mean Lord forbid I might fall or something
And I'm all or nothing cause (all I need is you)
To hold me down like bed straps to the psych ward
It's killing me but you still with me when I fight hard
And (all I need is you)
You digging me when I'm 'igging you
Get with me when my card's pulled
Coulda dealt with me but you fell for me 'fore I fell for you
To keep me on that right path and the right math
Cause you plus nothing is everything
You my everything, saying
(All I need is)
You, ain't gotta question my allegiance
Cause the way you love me I could never leave ya, I need ya

[Hook]
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

[Bridge x2]
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

[Verse 2]
How did I fall in this?
No condition that get a mention but you offered this
Unconditional love, I swear I sell it all for this
I'm tryna keep it together, forgive my awkwardness
But umm, often it's just you and me off in this
Valley of shadows and I know they trying to pick me off in this
But all I need is you
It's funny just how off I get when I ain't riding with you
No adjectives for your awesomeness
They burning one for that burn out
This life in God, I'm all turnt out
Took time out to put time in so I turn to you when I'm worn out
All I need is you
You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic, so juvenile
Know what you do
You keep me cool in the summer
When they be dressing less and I be wanting to show off and stunt
There ain't nothing to want, you give me all that I need
All I need is you to keep that fire burning for me
All I need is you

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody gone get in the way
Put that on my money in the bank
Cause you do what them others can’t
And I love that, yea
We gone ride till the rims fall off
Above it all, we can never fall, yea
Hold my hand, we can have it all
Hold my hand, we can have it all

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro]
You always pick me up when I'm feeling down
You always make it better for me some how
All I need is you, cause all I need is you
(All I need is you)[Produced by Dirty Rice and Joseph Prielozny]

[Intro]
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff they comfort me

[Verse 1]
I honestly grow insecure as I get older
Cause even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder
Comes a day when you slower
Time is takin' it's toll
45 on the back of the jersey upon yo' soul
I'm scared of letting go
I don't know what the future holds
My nightmares are having nightmares
I'm quite scared of what's right and fair
How I fare an eternity
Will I hear well done when He turn to me
Will I hear you care too much 'bout all of this stuff that really don't matter
You chased the wind and you won it
Got to the top of a two foot ladder
What's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after
Will I end up empty handed when I stand before my master
Did I master the mathematics of a passive disaster
Adding my selfish ambition all the while subtracting what matters
I don't know

[Hook: Lecrae]
Late nights I can't sleep
Will I fall
When I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout
At late nights I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering
What they thinking, thinking 'bout it all

[Verse 2]
In high school we tried to act all tough
I remember a couple times I couldn't back that up
Like when I ran from them vatos
Scuffin' up my zapatos
Scared of losing my hide
I was so embarrassed inside
If I could go back in time
I would stand and say something like
I ain't never scared, never scared, never scared
I'm lyin' I'm scared of these thoughts in my head
I'm scared of possibly pushin' people right over the ledge
When I said I pledge allegiance to the struggle
Then I turn around and buckle under stress and under pressure
Bible on my dresser that could teach my pain a lesson
But I'd rather not address it
Address is in depression
I'm scared if I confess it
That you gon' look at me like I'm somethin' less
And I'm such a mess

[Break]
Celui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes
Est celui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter
On trouve la liberté dans la confession
Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance

[Verse 3]
And it just so happens I'm wrestling with my status
I'm tryna see me like He do, not focusing on this madness
They count on me count me out
On account of they fear and doubts
Keep account of my wrongs
Trying to keep me inside they house
Some just keep me around
Gotta wonder what that's about
Yea, they wanna be politically correct I suppose
But I'm comfortable in my skin while they just pretend in they clothes
I'm scared of falling and failing in front of all of my foes
And I feel some friends are unfaithful
So I keep my small circle closed
I don't want no handouts or favors
No functional saviors
I'mma tell that truth 'till it kill me
And I'm chillin' with my Creator
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters
For the ones that think I forgot Him
And the ones who won't let me say it
I ain't scared no mo'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Everybody always
They gon' have something to say whether you like it or not
Everybody always
They gone have something to say
Baby, don't take it to heart
Something to say

[Outro]
恐怖を受け入れることができないものは、
それに打ち勝つことができないだろう。
全てのものを受け入れたとき、
自由は存在し、恐怖は解き放たれる。[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Check it
Look at me I'm all the way turnt up
I ain't smoking but my homie in here burnt up
Yeah, I'm working on him, But he straight though
Couple girls trying to twerk it on me, wait- no
No, hold up
Before you even roll up I'm in here with my lady
Can't you see me man? I'm sewed up
Man I'm in here trying to celebrate a birthday
And you know I'm good aware its a work day
No matter, we still gon' kick it
And we ain't getting trippy, no molly in my sippy
Ain't fighting nobody, ain't nobody set tripping
It's Southeast Diego in the building
Shout-out to Peter Pan, Skyline and Pierro
We out here trying to function, holler if you with it though
Prolly think I'm rolling, I'm just high on the spirit bro
The only thing we popping is the truth, you don't hear me though

[Hook: Lecrae]
They prolly think I'm rolling, I ain't on nothing
They prolly think I'm rolling, I ain't on nothing
They prolly think I'm rolling, I ain't on nothing
But what I got you need to know about cause homie

[Bridge: Lecrae] (x8)
I'm turnt (I'm turnt)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Everybody slow-motion leaning off the potion
I tell em I'm straight trying to keep my mind focused
Came 40 deep cliqued up, crew love
Got em' looking at us crazy cause we so turnt up
Yeah homie I'm turnt, I'm turnt, I'm turnt, I'm turnt
I ain't popping, rolling and I ain't burnt
So tell Mary and Molly I don't need em' to party
Someone woke up in the lobby trying to locate they wallet
While I'm nine holes in trying to work on my hobby
And I wish somebody would get me started
Aye deuces up to Nipsey, K-dot and Game
I'm out here in the west, gone and holler at me man
My blood stream clean, nothing running through my veins
Its 116, yeah I'm still Unashamed
I call it network if I'm out here fishing
You know I'm with clique and man we out here tryna kick it
You know that we turnt

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from the flight deck. We're cruising at 37,000 feet and we just passed over the coast. We'll be beginning our descent in about 30 minutes. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to America

[Verse 1]
I was made in America
Land of the free, home of the brave
And right up under your nose You might see a sex slave being traded
And we'll do anything for the money
Boy, a mama might sell her babies
Sell porn, sell pills, anything to pay the bills
Anything to bring that pay
Gotta scratch that itch, gotta scratch them ticks
Ain’t rich, but I might be
And Imma shoot these flicks, Imma turn these tricks
Anything for a slight fee
Yeah, made in America
Momma told me that I belong here
Had to earn our stripes, had to learn our rights
Had to fight for a home here
But I wouldn't know a thing about that
All I know is drugs and rap
I probably could have been some kinda doctor
Instead of holding guns and crack
I was born in the mainland
Great-Grandpa from a strange land
He was stripped away and given bricks to lay
I guess you could say he a slave hand
But I was made in America
So I don’t know a thing about that
All I know is Uncle Sam looking for me working on his corner
So I know I gotta pay tax
Getting paid in America
I was raised in America
And this is all I ever known
If I’m wrong then you better come save me America

[Hook]
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America

[Verse 2]
Man I’d die for America
I served my time for America
Got shot-shot back went to war
Got back and ain’t nobody give a jack in America
I could lost my life boy I lost my wife
I can’t even get right in my home land
Cold sweats, whole ticks, paranoia
Looking out for a threat in own land
I was trained in America
How they get up in the planes in America
Flew them right into the buildings
Taking out civilians
People getting killed in America?
And I’m still in America
Though America ain’t feeling me
I went to war for this country
Turn around came home and you drilling me
When y’all free here saying you don’t wanna be here
Boy you probably couldn't breathe here
If I didn’t load a couple magazines here
Y’all just complain in America
I’m jumping out of military planes from America
Aye, I was made in America
Thats why I’m out here saving America
I got a brother in the cemetery now
Cause he wanted y’all safe
And everybody want the freedom but nobody want to hear "about face!"
We bled for America
To keep y’all fed in America
But what's the point of talking
A lot of y’all don’t really even care America

[Hook]
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Ta na na na muchawa muchawa ta na na na
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America, welcome to America
Welcome to America
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa
Ta na na na muchawa ta na na na na

[Verse 3]
I wish I lived in America
Wanna raise my kids in America
Heard everybody rich
All I gotta do is run, jump, kick
I'm a hit in your area
So please pick me America
I know you probably never loved me
You never hear about me on the news
And you probably never been to my country
I hear you selling education and got clothes that you throw away
Got plenty food in your nation
I could tell cause a lot of y’all are over weight
I already work for y’all
I’m at a sweatshops making these shirts for y’all
Naw, I ain’t gettin money
Go to bed hungry, but I make some exports for y’all
But y’all don’t know a thing about that
You was made in America
I’m trying to find me a ticket where the sky is the limit
Catch a plane to America
It should be plain to America
Y’all blessed and you got it made
Heard y’all don’t pray no more, y’all ain’t saved no more
Y’all looking for another way
Well I hope it ain’t true, but I’m packing my suit
Farewell to my mother land
Said bye to my loved ones
Fate here I come, I’m going to another land
I done made it to America
I’m amazed at America
But I couldn’t get approval to stay so they sent me away from America[Intro]
Unashamed, 116 in the mix

[Verse 1]
Yes, B.E.T. done let me back up in this
Business unfinished plus my ending's got an appendix
Menace to your society, lyrics full of sobriety
Body me if you don't like these policies that I be lobbying
Sick of seeing them hollow hearted get swallowed by Audemars and automatics
I manually give them the manual and I know they panic
When I say Jesus or Emmanuel
Partna I was a cannibalistic fallible animal
People looking for change and they fooled us into thinking it was Franklin
You only get one shot and you drank it
The lost art of thinking coupled with our depravity
Got me praying he'll free us from this Gravity
Now on a lighter note I hope that they bring back 'The Wire'
Hope Lupe don't retire hope I leave you all inspired
I'm rewired ironchest, tireless, I am blessed
With the Spirit that resurrects the dead, try and test, yes

[Outro]
You know what it is... 116 Unashamed
Yessir, and we out[Hook]

Self proclaimed kings bragging cause they on chrome
But 26 inches is a pretty low throne

They riding on chrome on chrome on chrome
A pretty low throne low throne low throne
On chrome on chrome on chrome
Low throne low throne low throne

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Peep it, peep it OH MY GOD!
Pe-peep these people fiending
Fiending to be seen as kings and leaning in they, CHROMED OUT CARS
Ri-riding high, su-superfly wood wheel, they grasp it tight
Locomotive midnight strolling through Georgia they Gladys Knight
Tipping, neon glass is bright switches make the back take flight
Lay it down, raise it up stu-stunting gives ‘em bragging rights
All this so they swag is tight idolatry for status right
But they blind to the prison and the image that they living in all this sin from Adam’s vice
All of us we get this, yeah distorted views of image, yeah
Made in God’s likeness but despite this mankind is blemished, yeah
So men chase them fancy cars riding on them fancy bars
All so they can get respect when we cruising down the boulevard
So I grab the mic in here just to bring some light in here
Flip-flip the script just like a switch to spark this hit bring Christ in here
Since man can’t see who they should be I’m a spit this so they can see
Outside of Christ you’re bound for life a slave to your Idolatry

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I see ya riding Big Boi
Like Andre and his friend, boy
Got the SUV with the chromed out feet
And the seats is ostrich skin, boy
And naw that ain’t a sin, boy
But tell me where it ends, boy
Cause the truck don’t bring you luck and sho nuf ain’t goin pay yo sins, boy
Gone head worship that tin toy
And in the end watch crumple like tin foil
Is that what you really wanna live for, do you read me, dawg?
Is that 10-4? You spent 10-4 chrome, bruh
But Jesus still don’t know ya
You worship that cold steel and still ya heart is colder
Can’t say we ain’t told ya, we told you like we s'posed to
The rims don’t deserve that praise but the one who does hung like a poster
You post up on the block so the girls they flock
When they see you ridin' by, the boys see ya ridin'
High and you the one that they admire
Now if you jacked and crash that whip
That’ll hurt you pride, yo status stripped
You thought your car could bless you like it’s God
But no my father is
Idolatry it bothers Him
And when they make some hotter rims
Your gods gets rusty so you change religions like Madonna did

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
They look hard like OH, GOD!, and you make them they say who that?
So you look hard like you God, all the while you ain’t really got a clue that
E-ve-ry-thang (thang) was made for the king of kings
True that through the only name, higher than every name
You don’t get it then you maybe wanna move back
Yeah, I’m trying to tell ya mane yeah, I’m trying to warn ya dog
You can play me to the left like I’m dribbling to the right and get defensive but sin will score on ya you dog
Leave you marred in your vision all scarred like incisions
Men marked like in prison that ain’t all dog
Pretty soon there’s an idol assuming the Lord’s title
Like He’s idle but He’s more like a sawed-off
When it comes, to His glory
Man please believe me, BOY, He don’t play that
This is more, than metaphors
Man this is the truth so baby, BOY, where your faith at
Let me help, it should be in One who provides
Better yet, the only One who could save our lives
Cause the things on this earth shouldn’t be placed first
Over Him, the only One who gave us His life
But on the cool (on the cool) it ain’t sin (it ain’t sin), if you ride rims (ride rims) (ugh-uhh)
Make it do (make it do) what it do (what it do) but whatever you do, don’t idolize them
But if you have (if you have) then repent turn back now cry out to Him
Commandment one, demands that none, be placed above this God in hereYes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist

Shout out to all the artists
If there's a truth to us
Hello to all the bloggers
How you doing reviewers?
You should know that we're human
And this voice that you listen
Is a husband and father
A brother, a Christian
The stage I've been given
It ain't gold cause it glitter
Know what it's like when people judge
Like they know you from Twitter
Or even Facebook
"J's a snake and a lie
He's just a fake
I hit him up
He ain't never reply"
I, I've been gone but not on vacation
And I get home, the wife here's got the baby waiting
My son he got a game
I've been booked for a show
This is our bread and butter
That means I gotta go
No, and I ain't asking for sympathy
I'm just asking for grace and prayer
Remember me
I'm some of what you hear
Portions of what you see
I know I'm a artist
But overall I'm me

Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
We, we are not just what you don't wanna see deep
I am just me, I'm human

[Lecrae]

You ain't really real no more
You don't be making music people really feel no more
You used to preach a whole sermon in your songs
Now you sounding kinda watered down
Man what's going on?
Homie I done matured
I have so many issues at heart
Thought that screaming it through my art made me better, set me apart
If I never get to make another Rebel, it's cool
That was a season in my life, let it settle
And I'm in a new season
Growing as a man
I done been around the world
And started my own fam
I've see a lot of pain
I done been through it
Learned their characters more than the things you know and what you do
Who you calling Illuminati?
Not me, got me?
Confused with someone who not me
And if my songs don't define me
Interviews are a piece
So you don't really know me when you see me in the streets
I'm just human

Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
We, we are not just what you don't wanna see deep
I am just me, I'm human

My ears stay to the streets
I hear and I listen
But it's good
We all entitled to our own opinions (true)
I embrace your critique
And I'm open to challenge
Let there be grace and truth so I can receive it with balance
I ain't angry or mad
Know the purpose for real
Is that you see me as a person
I hurt and I feel
You hit me up
I wish I could chop it and build with ya
If I'm honest with my life
This is not a real picture
So if we come off cocky or arrogant even, forgive us
We're falling people
Still growing in Jesus
The difference is when they like you and think you rhyme tight
When you fall they throw us all in lime light

Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
We, we are not just what you don't wanna see deep
I am just me, I'm human[Intro: Lecrae]

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yo clicked up 40 deep in the street you can find us
Ya we on theology but we be on the grind ya
When we was a youngers only had 2 place to run to
One become an animal, two get out the jungle
So we got our lion on the line bro, that’s what we do
Run up on you and your crew and tell ya’ll Jesus is the truth
Open air evangelists, relationships, we do it all
Backpack still full of tracks with a Johnny Mac, hats to the back and our backs to the wall
Plus I got some homies out there who gon’ rep the rock
If you wanna make them stop, you gon’ have to bring a choppa
If they get martyred, then we gon’ go harder
Share the gospel on death row and let ‘em know that they been pardoned
You don’t wanna get it started, this is what we do, who we are
1-1-6 to the day we die, ain’t tryin to be no superstars
Chicks to the click that’ll pull your car?
Usin’ the street like cops in cars?
You ain’t hear the truth today, I promise we’ll be back tomorrow

[Hook]
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious
Clicked up 40 deep, hey holla at us if you curious
Clicked up 40 deep, we all saved, all serious
Clicked up 40 deep, come holla at us if you curious
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Yah)
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Yah, it’s community baby, haha)
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Let’s take it back, Creezie, let’s talk about it)
Clicked up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (Let me show you Tedashii’s style, baby)

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
To the streets, like 'Crae
Clicked up 40 deep, all day
Backpacks they strap ‘em Johnny Mac and tracts to play for me this morning to label the streets, all day (okay)
1-1-6 for your boy, man this more than just some artistry
Cliqued up in community, baby, this here the heart of me
I get every thinking body you gon have to pardon me
Wanna know the truth brought a partner this here was stallin me
Real talk, real talk, before it was the real talk
I was in community just trying to have a real walk
Looking for direction but at times that I would feel lost
What's accountability? Your boy was prone to be alone
Folk making war within the stars; Han Solo
God used somebody to wake me minus the NoDoz
We do the plumb line I can see myself like a photo
He made us for community, another way's a no-go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
A clique of us is shining rhyming walking talking sharing Christ, very hype
Find us hiding behind him all prepared to fight, very tight
Fighting trying to share the cross. He spared of life
We’re living by the blood like we’re parasites, get it right
My team carries bunch of high beam blaring lights
Might seem scary but we nice, see we carry life
Light is seen clearly man we’re glaring very bright
Check the fleet man we deep so we might seem Barry White
Ever since we heard about the murder how they buried Christ
Eyes upon the cross even though that is a scary sight
But that was the merger we converted now we very tight
He died for His bride homie, How you like the married life?
Christ the name we calling on
Can't wait until He calls us home
You know we be falling often we can't walk it all alone
My crew's always rhyming like some stalkers we ain't stalkin' homes
Started with the cross and we continue with the cross alone

[Hook][Verse 1]
Hey look, Cole talk that college talk
Wayne talk gangs
Jay be talking money man and Ye' talk fame
And people say I talk about the same ole thang
The reason why I sound the same is cause the truth don't change
Look, people get it twisted like a lemon in a spirit
If I ain't talking killing I must be talking bout healing
Nah, I ain't talking 'bout how Jesus gonna make me a million
With my hands to the ceiling I got that spiritual feeling
My head bowed down, my knees to the floor
Oh you a Christian and you rap
That must be the way you flow, no
I talk reality like mama on her death bed
The birth of a child, a soldier losing his left leg
Who gon' write songs to give him hope in they chair
Addicted to pain killers, wife left last year
Your favorite rapper was probably tryin' to make his next hit
Talking look at what I did, who I shot and who I tipped
Couldn't be more common if them boys made sense
Couldn't be more common if Serena was they chick
Ay, that's not a diss that's how reality sound
Let it off my mind, this how my mentality sound
We going, down south it sound like New Orleans
But this is kind of Floridian so let me get the scene
Uh, let me spit it
Hold on, that's off the dome
Get the microphone, yea you know it's on

[Verse 2]
I never fit in, I been a outcast
In grade school I was blasting my Outkast
And I'll pass on running to catch a route pass
Gimme a pen and a pad and I'm tryna outlast
All of my idols
American and the foreigners
Before I heard all of these boring bars
Money, money, money, sex, drugs and the foreigners
The coroners all these talkin' 'bout the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at?
Aye, all this money where the Bugattis at?
You dig a lil' deeper
You gon' see another insecure man sittin' in a two seater
The same little boy that used to get beat up
With plenty pains in his past you could bring up
But listen I ain't tyna string up
I'm freestylin' off the dome you know I had to get up

[Verse 3]
Y'all get to steppin' I get to startin'
You dream of being a king but you watchin' the wrong Martin bruh man
This ain't the fifth floor, it's the penthouse
So get it together or just get out
I know you rarely get out of the basement
This dark full of hatred your heart harder than pavement
But I came for something amazing
It's that grace that I lay in and I stay in
Uh, I gotta little mo' though
I got a little more flow though
Hold on let me get it together
Yea, oh the beat 'bout to change up

[Verse 4]
Yo, waiting for some good news
Funny, cause I already got the greatest
Can't nobody say they made us
The aim was not to be famous
Don't pay us no nevermind if we don't let the money change us
This what God told me
'Crae don't switch the style up
If they hate then let 'em hate
That's how they did my child, ooh kill 'em!
My team watchin' I'm runnin' the ball go get 'em
You silly you pleading that silly cars, you silly
You really should pay attention
You missing the mission
You too caught up in these titles and if I'm rapping religion
I'm just rapping my gift
I give to you if you want it
Aye, I ain't see you at my concert, guess you ain't on it
Guess you missing the moment, missing the point
Let me chill out
Y'all understand the words that are comin' out my midouth?
Cause ever since I been out, these people told me get out
You backwoods Holy Ghost hollering faith mental
You Holy Ghost right-wing judgmental, you get out
Huh, it's funny cause everyone 'gon be sent out, huh
But I ain't even tripping on the judge man
It's Sway in the Morning man and I ain't finna budge manYeah, I got a question, after the show, after the set, after the music stops, what's next? Are we just writing songs or are we concerned with uniting a people to follow the great commission of Christ
Yeah let's get it, let's go...

Back in the day I was a lunch line rapper, after that I guess I was a punch line rapper, then I got saved and sometime after, ya boy came back as a frontline rapper, and when I say the frontlines, that's not a frontline, I’m out here preachin’ Christ on the frontlines, and no it ain't about rockin' stages ‘coz some of my engagements are out on the pavements yeah

I'm out to take the bible, create disciples, who make disciples, disciple-cycles, that's why I want the beats to knock so after the music stops you can meet the rock I pray, that you would know him well, this is like show and tell, it's more than a show, I'm showing you Emmanuel

So yeah I’m hopin’ that you're likin' the flow but it's only so you could know that God I’m writing it for let's go...

After the show, after the set, after the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples, will you open your bibles after the music stops

After it’s over, after it ends, after the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that Christ is King? Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

I recorded a couple songs some fast some slow, so the listeners would know the importance of the show, the importance of the show's not to excite these folks but make God's truth relevant, ignite these folks
Discipleship is our call but we make disciples, this is not a suggestion, create disciples. The teachin' is a process, it's not over night and it’s not a stage and a mic nah, it's life on life Christ -

Walked with twelve, ate with twelve, talked with twelve, shaped the twelve, invested in 'em well you could say that he made the twelve. Who made many more, who made plenty more, now it's on you and me if there's anymore
1 teach, 2 teach, 3 teach, 4 teach, 5 teach, 6 teach, 7 teach more, this is what we've been commissioned, it's the reason why I write, so that you could hear the truth, not so you can say I’m tight whoa...

After the show, after the set, after the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples, will you open your bibles after the music stops

After it’s over, after it ends, after the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that Christ is King? Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops

So, we write this for the right the speaker was righteous, and then we might check for a culture who likes the hypeness. Some say we keep it crunk, some say we hype man; we just wanna pump the resurrection of the Christ man
We in the -burbs and the hoods that's hostile, we share a common view like synoptic Gospels and you know we keep a couple young dudes around us and teach 'em the same truth God used to ground us
This is a lifestyle so, when the mic's down I pray people follow Christ when they turn the lights down. I pray that everybody playin’ this song will be challenged by everything I had to say in this song
I don’t do this for the money, I don’t do this for fame, I don’t do this so the industry can know my name, I do this and host to glorify Yeshua the King, if you’re feelin’ me you know you should be doin’ the same let’s go…

After the show, after the set, after the music stops what's next?
Will there be fellowship, prayer, disciples, will you open your bibles after the music stops

After it’s over, after it ends, after the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that Christ is King? Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops[Hook]
Aliens! Strangers in Places, foreign in lands that we are in
Call us peculiar, but know that we are
Aliens! Strangers in Places, foreign in lands that we are in
Call us peculiar, but know that we are
Aliens! Aliens! Strangers in Places, foreign in lands that we are in
Call us peculiar, but know that we are Aliens!

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
A - A whole notha kind of folks, kinda slow
But we gotta go cause the world's so ill
L - Livin' the life and livin' it right
And livin' for Christ and that's real in the field
I- Intelligent but irrelavent without Christ
It's nothing but another sin element
E- Eternal Purpose, without it this earth is dead and worthless
N- Never stop giving Him Props
Giving Him praise now until the end of our days
S- Seek Him and please Him and let the people know that they need Him
Aliens! New Creations, new free agents, ain't signed to sin
What the world do, we don't do
Cause we wanna do what the Lord does, Christ within. our system
Listen our mission's the Great Commisssion, we come here to represent Him
That's why we call ourself Christians, Ha, Let me spit another line
For the Plumbline and the Frontline one time on the front lines
Keep holdin' it down for all the pilgrims
All over the world representing for the bloodline

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
I feel like running through the middle of the campus
With the Gammas dropping hammers, waving banners, saying "JESUS SAVES!"
Bringing together the bretheren in a circle in a cipher
On the corner yellin' "Pass the Phrase!"
Taking heirs of the Kingdom to the field of mission
So they can spill vision to the children missin'
Telling the men in prison
About the "Peace be stiller" "Mr. Rise & Walk" and "Mr. Heal your vision"
Mr. Jesus of Nazareth
Bloodied and beaten and we were the reason for the massacare
For the sin I commit and even when I slip His love is there to grab us up
So as for us, We Hit hoods just like caddilacs
And like James in the Kackalacki
Do things that will make Him Happy
He asks and we do them gladly
We came here as satan's lacky's
Now through Christ I call Him Daddy
He changed us from actin' crappy
Now I'm just a pilgrim passing
I learned that I don't belong
Got new game, new life, new song
Don't fit in? theres nothing wrong, Anti-culture's what I'm on
Royal Priesthood, a chosen one, Rep Him well until He comes
Proposing to people about the propitiation
Pre-paid when Christ died and decided it was done
Preaching to the pushed aside prostitute
Destitute working the block just to feed her son
So if you see us lookin' different dog don't be trippin' just
Know that we are ALIENS!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I wish I had a dollar every time I heard em
Holla that I look like seem like talk like them
I blend in til I stand out and shout "Jesus!"
Man I really wanna be like Him
And it's funny, they love me until I speak the truth
And then they say I'm trying salt they game
I gotta do it, I'm the salt of the earth
I eat, breathe, sleep, think, walk, and talk that man
We are not from this planet, we are not from this earth
C.O.G.'s something distinctive bout the way that we work
I never wanna be discredited for editing the elements
Evident of a heaven sent resident
I just wanna represent
Jesus He the way, the holy King, the priest, and the President
I'mma put it in motion, the world loves sin they boastin'
They put it on like some lotion
If you focused you fall for the hocus pocus
And fall tryna gain ya focus, and I ain't Jokin'
We ain't here to play no games we foreigners in new terrain
Here on mission to represent Him and full of biblical amnuition
We aliens!

[Hook][Verse 1]
Keep me in my timezone when my mind's gone
When I'm flying home
And I'm stressed out and I'm tempted to get that styrofoam
And go pour it up, but you know what's up
And you know that ain't gone solve nothing
I mean Lord forbid I might fall or something
And I'm all or nothing cause (all I need is you)
To hold me down like bed straps to the psych ward
It's killing me but you still with me when I fight hard
And (all I need is you)
You digging me when I'm 'igging you
Get with me when my card's pulled
Coulda dealt with me but you fell for me 'fore I fell for you
To keep me on that right path and the right math
Cause you plus nothing is everything
You my everything, saying
(All I need is)
You, ain't gotta question my allegiance
Cause the way you love me I could never leave ya, I need ya

[Hook]
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, all I know
(All I need is you)

[Bridge x2]
You, you're all I ever needed
You're all I ever needed

[Verse 2]
How did I fall in this?
No condition that get a mention but you offered this
Unconditional love, I swear I sell it all for this
I'm tryna keep it together, forgive my awkwardness
But umm, often it's just you and me off in this
Valley of shadows and I know they trying to pick me off in this
But all I need is you
It's funny just how off I get when I ain't riding with you
No adjectives for your awesomeness
They burning one for that burn out
This life in God, I'm all turnt out
Took time out to put time in so I turn to you when I'm worn out
All I need is you
You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm acting like it's all copacetic
It's so pathetic, so juvenile
Know what you do
You keep me cool in the summer
When they be dressing less and I be wanting to show off and stunt
There ain't nothing to want, you give me all that I need
All I need is you to keep that fire burning for me
All I need is you

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Ain't nobody gone get in the way
Put that on my money in the bank
Cause you do what them others can’t
And I love that, yea
We gone ride till the rims fall off
Above it all, we can never fall, yea
Hold my hand, we can have it all
Hold my hand, we can have it all

[Hook + Bridge]

[Outro]
You always pick me up when I'm feeling down
You always make it better for me some how
All I need is you, cause all I need is you
(All I need is you)[Intro: Lecrae]
Aye, what if
What if we all need anger management?
Why don't we just
Treat this song like a, an anger management class?
You feel me?

[Hook: Thi'sl & Lecrae]
I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm busting, I'm poppin'
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving
Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something
I'm angry

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Been up all night, Got me feeling weak
No sleep on the first day of a long week
I guess I'm still in school,These people testing me
But disrespecting me I will respond aggressively
A long day short fuse in the worst mood
My temper red hot I will get these boys blues
Hard livin got me feelin very selfish
Crab in a bucket tryin' crush these other shellfish
Forget the chip upon my shoulder man I carry boulders
I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'
When people pop off at the mouth I try to keep the cool
But all I wanna do is fix 'em, troubleshoot
Yeah they say I'm wrong if this carries on
The faith I claim to have I'll probably never own
Empty waiting pool running out of patience
This is anger management get me another agent

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Thi'sl]
I'm angry every morning before I get up off the bed
This dog keep on barkin I'mma bust em in the head
Uncle keep on trippin if he want to he can get it too
Anybody say another word I'mma act the fool
I hit the dough, push my fitted to the side
Heart full of pride, anger in my eyes
Been this way since the day I seen my homie die
Now I'm mad at the world and I hate that I'm alive
Really hate to say it cos it's killing me inside
All I wanna be is loved and it's eating me alive
Don't nobody love me man my momma and my daddy don't
My uncle ain't my uncle cos I'm living in a foster home
I say I'm saved but I'm scared of the truth
Cus I read Galatians 5 and I didn't see the fruit
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
So I hit my knees and pray, God take this thing away

[Hook]
I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving
Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something
I'm angry

[Verse 3]
I would die for my respect
But I got no humility
And Jesus paid my debt while
I reject him willingly
Man I got some nerve
Holding anger in my heart
The Father could have come serve me that beef up A La Carte
Not to mention torture, Jesus took all my misfortune
I’ve been freed from the Law, but I'm serving these court orders
Unforgiveness is my pedigree, you say you’re sorry better be
Better bein' mad at you, than try'na be a better me
Ain't nothin' in my workin' tryna demonstrate His worth
And though He show me plenty grace, I don't extend to other persons
And that anger led to murder
When you pull up on that murder scene
It's Jesus nailed upon that cross, yeah the murderer was me

[Outro]
1 Peter 2:23 man, when they used to hurl insults at Jesus, He didn't retaliate
He entrusted Himself to the One that judges justly. The gospel manages our anger, ya feel me? The solution is to gain a heart that's thankful for grace in Jesus Christ![Verse]
I never fit in I was a outcast
In grade school out blasting my Outkast
And I'll pass on running to catch a route pass
Gimme a pen and a pad I'm tryna outlast
All of my idols, American and the foreign-ers
Before the foreign cars & the boring bars
Money money money sex drugs and the coroners
All this killin' but where the bodies at
All this money where the Bugattis at
But dig a lil deeper
And you'll find another insecure man sittin' in a 2 seater
The same little boy that got beat up
Plenty pains in his past you could bring up
Nobody ever told him he could be more than he is
But inside he's a leader
I didn't know who was inside me either
Striving to be a captain
Hopin' I could date a cheerleader
Tryna get me a throne of my own so I could put my feet up
Thank God my kingdom was overthrown by the soul redeemer

[Outro]
Yeah, anomaly
Deviation from the common rule
Something or somebody that’s abnormal
That doesn’t fit in
I say that’s exactly what we are
We are the odd, the outcasts, the peculiar, the strangers
And they say we don’t fit in
But I say we are exactly who God created us to be
Anomalies
The system didn't plan for thisAlbum Art:

Ten-Four Charlie I think we got a problem

You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he outta there
You seen him, he gone

[Verse 1: Thi'sl]
Saint Louis my city dog, west side, was the block
While you was in the crib playing with Legos
I was out there trying to get blocks
Momma gone, daddy gone, just me and my hood, dawg
SuWooping, beaned up, like I'm bout to go play baseball
Before you ever heard about Jeezy boy I was already on some Trap or Die
Was a goon, 'fore it was cool, You can still see the pain in my eyes
What you know about sitting in a jail cell, felonies, murder case
Best friend, rolled on me, take the stand, turned state
I am a felon, I tell no lie
Hand on the Bible, hand to the sky
I wanna live, I ain't wanna die
When they rolled upon me and let them bullets fly
That could have been the end, dawg
One way, Hell's gates
But the Lord stepped in, chose to show grace
Could have been laid in the box, dawg
6 of my homeboys carry me
But I'm alive and the old me gone
Cause everyday dawg I bury me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Ok, hydroponic lungs, top shelf liver
Limb a lil' tender, I can chop down timber
I was no pretender, certified offender, never know surrender
My amnesia's circumstantial, though some things I can't remember
Those who knew me be like "who he?", they tripping off the new me
They like "Man, where the old Crae? You crazy, you can't fool me
I would party so hard that the law was tryna find me
I pray to God they ain't find me But then I hear the {WHOOP-WHOOP}
Look up in the rear view and they're right behind me
Roll down my window- "Boy what's your name?
Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man"
Then I gave them my ID, and guess what they say
"This boy here crazy, naw that's just Crae"
Man I was psycho, wild as the hundreds
I do like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted
Until I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed
They like "man what you do? Something 'bout you just ain't the same"
I was dead. The old me was nothing but a sucker
Sucked the life out of my mother, just to get the stuff I wanted
Now I'm milk carton status and "different" can't explain it
Put the APB out on me, if they find me that's amazingWhoa

[Intro: Lecrae]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin' to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
On the reel
I'm a man
But I guess it's just my gender
When it comes to manhood
Man we leave it to our sisters
What a tragedy travesty passive in our actions
Living absentee
Stand and wait while asking them to marry me
We wait left into death saying next what a mess
Beating on my chest and thinking I am strong go flex
If you gone take charge for the Lord then you'll lead out
Being one who serves like the one who chose to bleed out
Submitting to authority government that's over me
And to the Father who is sovereign real men stay orderly
I learned to submit because God gives the command
While she follows me cause I follow him with holes in his hands

[Hook: Lecrae (Tedashii)]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

(Bow down
Bow down)
To authority
To authority

And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
(Bow down
Bow down)
To authority

[Verse 2: Derek Minor (fka PRo)]
Hey I don't care what they tell you that cat's trying to sell you
You was made in the image of God his craftsmanship is in your cells dude
You are not a animal or just a foolish beast
You were made to oversee this Creation of the King now
Flashing your badge like a cop that's got some power
But you should be a tool to encourage and empower
And stop runnin' round with women like a little dog in heat
If she disrespect herself show her who she's supposed to be
She a queen and the scriptures say she is the weaker vessel
It's more like fine china
Doesn't mean she's any lesser
The equal wouldn't smash fine art to the ground
So why use your body or your words to tear her down, heyyy

[Hook]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

[Verse 3: KB]
You ask em what's a man?
They say that dude that got them stacks on stacks
In rubber bands finger to the government
I want it I get it it's mine
Can't tell me nothing bro
My money my girl and my nine
These my rules(What you talkin bout?)
No one man should have all that power
He doesn't have it cause power is not ours
Feelin like you in control no you are owned
God is running it do as you're told
Ok let me talk to him real quick
Let me get to talkin bout submitting to authority
Somebody being over me we say no no
But we gotta get that if we are not submitting
Than we missing the fact that we are not our own
God can judge me and the judge says
If you do not follow then you can't lead
Get it
Live it
Got it
Good

[Hook]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority[Verse 1: Chris Tomlin]
Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
I come alive, I’m alive when You breathe on me
I come alive, I’m alive when You breathe on me

[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, for You alone
Awake my soul

[Verse 2: Chris Tomlin]
Speak to me, word of God, speak to me
Speak to me, word of God, speak to me
I come alive, I’m alive when You speak to me
I come alive, I’m alive when You speak to me

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Lecrae]
Then He said to me
Prophesy to these bones and say to them
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones
I will make breath enter you
And you will come to life
So I prophesied as I was commanded
As I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound
And the bones came together, bone to bone
And I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them
And skin covered them, but there was no breath in them
Then He said to me
Prophesy to the breath
Prophesy, son of man, and say to it
Conjure the four winds of breath and breathe

[Chorus]
(x2)

[Outro: Lecrae]
Yeah, I’m not alone, I realize
You breathe out, I come alive
Your word gives life to my dry bones
Your breath tells death it can ride on
Awake me, make me a living stone
A testament to your throne, I
I’m nothing without You, I’m on my own
The only one who satisfies my soul[Hook: Andy Mineo]
I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead?
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just gon' lose my soul?
And my ways ain't purified, don't live according to Your Word
I can't endure this life without Your wisdom being heard
So word to every dancer for a pop star
Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rockstar
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright
So let me fall back, stop giving my suggestions
Cause when I follow my obsessions, I end up confessing
That I'm not that impressive, matter of fact
I'm who I are, a trail of stardust leading to the superstar

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I had a dream that I was captain of my soul
I was master of my fate, lost control, and then I sank
So I don't want to take the lead, cause I'm prone to make mistakes
All these folks who follow me, gon' end up in the wrong place
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, cause I only trust in me
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, You know what's in my hand
Me, I just roll and trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is You the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background, like it's an instrument

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lecrae]
I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred
And I ain't got no time to play life's foolish games
Got plenty aims, but do they really glorify Your name?
And it's a shame, the way I want to do these things for You, yet
Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from You
Seems You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's cause she never heard of this

[Hook 2x][Chorus: Andy Mineo]
I could play the background
I could play the background
Cause I know sometimes I get in the way
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead, lead, lead
So won't You take the lead, lead, lead, lead, lead
And I could play the background, background
And you could take the lead

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
It's evident you run the show, so let me back down
You take the leading role, and I'll play the background
I know I miss my cues, know I forget my lines
I'm sticking to your script, and I'm reading all your signs
I don't need my name in lights, I don't need a starring role
Why gain the whole wide world, If I'm just going lose my soul
And my ways ain't pure if I don't live according to Your Word
I can't endure this life without Your wisdom being heard
So word, to every dancer for a pop star
Cause we all play the background, but mine's a rock star
Yeah, so if you need me I'll be stage right
Praying the whole world will start embracing stage fright

I know I'm safest when I'm in Your will, and trust Your Word
I know I'm dangerous when I trust myself, my vision blurred

Don't even cling to you, take time to sit and glean from You
It seems You were patient in my ignorance
If ignorance is bliss, it's cause she never heard of this

[Chorus] (x2)Oh yeah! (Oh yeah)
Here we go! (Here we go)
A little rough! (A little rough)
No sweat! (No sweat)
I can do it! (I can do it)
You can do it! (You can do it)
Ooorah! (Ooorah)
Left right...

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
Tell 'em bring their guns out
Send my city up in flames
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
But my hope still remains
Whether dead or alive, this is do or die
When Christ is the gain
So raise your torches up high
Tonight we fight for our King

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I was Tailored to snatch the mic' Swiftly like Ye' did
And lay it down for the king like a sleigh bed
And they can kill us now, go get the yellow tape
Hey put me 6 feet in the ground and watch a great escape
I promise, ain't a 6 shooter that can keep me down
My God's so official, that's a technical foul
Was engineered in my mother's womb for Gods' glory
Plenty faith in the persecution is inventory
I been spit in the face, still exhibiting grace
Kicked out many a place, just for sharing my faith
My belt tight, shoes laced, plus a breastplate
My war helmet on now I got my head straight
The battle's on but the war is over when Jesus reigns
And fo' His name I withstand the pressure and take the pain
And if they drop us, this promise, we'll take it to the grave
That tonight we may die, but to die is our gain!

[Hook]

[Sample]
Bout to be a riot, guns and fire, Somebody's dyin'

[Verse 2: Natalie Lauren]
But it won't be us, covered in His blood, spillin' our guts
But even if it was, let our dust blow in the wind, we win when it's done
Christ puttin' out thunder-raps with the nuns
So I am taking no prisoners, not-a-one
None, and no I'm not The One
I just run solar in the power of The Son
My God's a m-m-monsta
Treads on Black mambas defeats and conquers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Yeah, ready to die, notorious for our martyrs man
We die daily and wake up and do it all again
Either we certain or we certainly insane
Bullets riddlin' our frame, still we don't deny the Name
Maybe we lost it, we vuelvo loco
Cause Heaven is my home homie I ain't local
I'm so vocal
Chords of a chorus say we tied to the Lord like Chords
Of course
Hey what a course, if I get to goin' in
I'm going off like "kill me" I'm still goin' in
God, by all means possible
Give me the faith to live and die for the gospel

[Hook][Verse 1]
Carlos was born in killa cali was walking down an alley
And caught a bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly
He lost everything at that moment except his life
He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
He laid there in a coma but man nobody cared
The Gospel preached in his neighborhood? Nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
Back to hood you could find em preaching the bible
He led a homie to Christ from his same hood
Part of Church plant come on now ain't his name good
This is blessing but Im stressing that this is not the norm
We need leaders and belivers to help carry it on
But who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if Jesus is calling you that you would be found

[Verse 2]
Eric used to go to bible study as a kid
He got older and started doing what the hood did
A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
But the jammed up so them beat him nice
He woke up in the hospital singing bible songs
Praise God he had a place to learn the bible from
But then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ
They make him change his whole culture and way of life
He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
Go to seminary by then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth
And used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
The feet are beautiful if only they'd go
If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
Somebody please plant a church in his projects

[Verse 3]
In Luke 4:16 on down to 21
Jesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one
But more than that he quotes Isaiah
That shows our savior targets oppressed captive blind and the broke I'm saying
Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
And 1st John 2:6 is way we should go
In Deuteronomy even tho they under the law
The tithes every third year the poor got em all
I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word and
Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdened to have beautiful feet
You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to God you'd be burdened to those beautiful feet
Go, go, go (run with those beautiful feet)
Go, go, go
You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world
They can't believe in something they ain't never heard
Go, go, go and run with those beautiful feet[Intro: Pete Rock]
Let's go, let's go!
Jamla
Pete Rock!
Khrysis
How we're doing, son?

[Verse 1: Pete Rock]
It's a new day, new way
My hand's on the bottle
When your beat sound breakable
Something like bottles on the cobblestone
I carved my name and made it known
The boy wonder if it's Pete Rock, let's take it home!
For all my Gs who love real shit, you're not alone
A little world wide supporter set the tone
To stay in my zone and just try to...
The music hot, like pepper on the steak, kid!
Just like the nine mil' stripped you down naked
Funny style, nigga claim you're real, but you're fakers
Take a journey on my globe, trying to show you all seasons
Learn a thing or two for obvious reasons
Lay it down on the line, that part of my rhyme
You can die just my story and put it in your mind
A free spirit and complete design
Like I told you when the world was mine
The good times so defined
Fast break past the pill
No tricks in twenty tricks, it was time to bill

[Hook: Pete Rock]
And the motto is be inspired and not tired
And keep making beats and raps that cause fires
I'm not tripping, homie (aha)
I'm not tripping, homie
And the motto is be inspired and not tired
And keep making beats and raps that cause fires
Not tripping, homie (aha)
I'm not tripping homie

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
What if reality is faster than your third eye vision?
And our life is way more than what we see and we hearing?
When our heroes and our heroines all on heroine
Our inheritance is way more than the stuff they peddlin'
That American melatonin settles in
You fall asleep, only to wake up inside of hell's den
And that's connected to the kitchen if you pay attention
You never buy a wolf ticket to a snake convention
Meaning that if you open your eyes, you won't have to buy lies
But you couldn't pry em' open if you tried
That's why I pray!
Our worst enemies be dressing like the best of friends
And our killers be our next of kin
Yeah, I know I found the only way out of this mess we in
I'm done guessing, done stressing with the rest of them!
God is who I'm resting in, and I ain't sweating it!
It's living legends on this thing and they done let me in

[Hook]
And the motto is be inspired and not tired
And keep making beats and raps that crossfire

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
So ahead of my time, they're saying I'm 34
Momma she with the climb working on some awards
No celebrating tonight, till I own a Grammy or four
Diss to me what's the recipe, talent work at the courge
Put me in a force, make my own path, fuck a forbe
I'm a lane above anyone could probably touch commodores
Naturally high, most of you naturally lie, what for, huh?
Whenever in my corner, not everyone swear they sure, man
That I'm the best, or I'm close, or I got the gift to be
Duck, duck, goose I'm plucking off all my enemies!
Rolled up in a Honda now, I'm busting in the Acura
Yeah, I'm trying to be parking that Audia black backwards
Those are my list, and they're still talking about a list
Only thing left to talk about, everything else for shit! (oh my God!)
Bow down on my Benos, ain't gotta flaunt a ego
Niggas thinking they spitting, I'm 3000 below your ice cold
Reunited with illness, now cast of this real shit
And if you don't feel it is cause you saved it for your feelings!
I live life with no ceilings, I'm on top of my game
Spitting cane, codeine, say I'm dope, leave no remains!
Buried on one by one, and that was just for some fun today
They pray for forgiveness, my momma said that's the righteous way, yeah
That's the righteous way!

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Come on, come on
That's how we doing shit
Let's get it
Khrysis on the beat
Pete Rock
Ooo!
Yeah...[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I came home after a trip to Atlanta, a different planet
Is where they thought I came from after my ship had landed
Truth is I had this meeting with God and confessed my sin
And he gave me this new beginning all I could do then was pen it
I came home after a trip to Atlanta, a different planet
Is where they thought I came from after my ship had landed
Truth is I had this meeting with God and confessed my sin
And he gave me this new beginning all I could do then was pen it
All down in my notebook, just a lot of verses
Me learning how not to curse was like learning to write in cursive
She still flirting with me even though we up in church
And I'm fighting to memorize all these verses up in the word
You would have never seen it coming
A couple months ago I'm getting high with my cousin
And fast forward now around campus I am buzzing
Not really but it felt like that, it felt like rap was just another passion
Never thought I'd be at the Grammy's talking about my fashion
You don't believe in God? Well how do you explain what happened?
I promise we ain't plan it, now Christians unashamed from Zambia to Manhattan
Still looking for the pattern? Come On

[Hook]
What would it take to make you believe?
More fire from the sky? Another part in the sea?
The honest truth is, that you ain't got the power to see
And let me take you on this journey, it all started with me
Wassup
(x2)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Most of the things I thought I'd never do I did though
And I ain't nothing but a man standing up on his tiptoes
Shoutout to Kirk Franklin, but I ain't him
I'm what happens when hip-hop lets all the Saints in
I wouldn't call it gospel music, but I'm Christian though
And this what happen when a Christian flow
Now it's funny cause I don't really got a home
And this industry saying leave him alone
Unless he become a clone
Have me singing the same old songs, no power in 'em
But I'm too hard to understand, I'm an algorithm
And evidently it's evidence I'm a resident
Of somewhere that you know that you oughta be but you never been
So try to get used to me, cause I'mma settle in
Reminding you to settle your heavenly settlement
A sight for sore eyes, or an eyesore, it don't matter
I own a label, and guess what, I'mma sign more
