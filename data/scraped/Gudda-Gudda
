[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I like a long haired, thick red-bone
Open up her legs, then Filet Mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick,now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
But you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohh-oh-ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
(And bitch I'm Mack Maine...)
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie (hah) D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzle... baby
Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world [x5]
Young Mula, babyTRANSCRIBING, WILL BE UP SHORTLY

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
The South Side, the South Side, these bitches' mouth wide
Can't trust a pig, informant nigga, run the cop wired
They set us up, then book me up, you crooked fuck
Get to the jail, tell them bitches to look me up
I'm on top of my shit, Red Bottoms like how my shoe tastes
Standin' from where I'm at, the licro is my shoe lace
I chunk a deuce, pour a four all inside an eight ounce
I'm faded now, finna cut a ho off like K Camp
TMZ on my dick, they swear they can knock me off, shit
Harvey better chill 'fore niggas run in his office
Write our own article, tell the people who caused it
Faggot tried to hide, first spot we shot is the closet
Crazy mothafucka, Mossberg in the moshpit
Ever since I hit LA, I'm wildin' on my Pac shit
B.I.G., "Who Shot" shit, or Jay on his Roc shit
"Wop Wop," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Block Is Hot" shit

[Verse 2: Hood]
Fat Fly Nigga, landing on your runway
Got the work coming, I'm the black Mickey Monday
Snowflake fresher than the morning on a Sunday
I ain't a killer but my homie with the gun play
He the typa kid go to school and kill the lunch La-dy
Damn, crazy right? We the typa kids live a crazy life
We get money, fuck bitches, rock crazy ice
And it's Young Money Records, ho, I'm really with D'wayne
In the club drunk trippin' yelling "Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!"
Boy's insane, top down in the rain
Holding up traffic, shootin' dice in your lane
Niggas shot me in my back, but I'm back bro
No we not a Jack boy, we done jacked bro
Started sellin' crack, now a nigga sellin' crack flows
Meet me in the trap, I'll be right by the back door
You can get a Bow Wow, you can get a Fat Joe
You can get finessed, I'm from Dallas, boy, it's natural
You can get it all for a real pretty penny
Niggas in the hood cookin' chickens, eatin' Denny's
Hoody

[Verse 3: Euro]
Compare me to who? Compare me to what?
Compare me to them, I'm 100, I'm not like them
I'm talkin', been hustlin' before I seen her
Rick Ross video in that off-white Beamer
I'm at the bar taking shots of nightmares with dreamers
Shoot for the stars, hope the moon ain't [?]
Stepped in the game and I spit that ether
And I ain't leaving 'til I blow, funny, these hoes ain't either
Listen, it's February, leaves enough time for me
So by December, I should be a millionaire at least
The least, take my word, this the year I beast
And if not, y'all can kill me by New Years Eve, please

[Verse 4: Flow]
Rollin' blunts while I'm listening to my Jigga disc
Smokin', flickin' ashes from the tip of the pyramid
Dressed in black growing up, horns for my membership
White kid listened to my song then he slit his wrist
I have a nightmare to stop you niggas from dreaming
I never read the bible, but I watch angel and demons
The devil after me? Well fuck it, I'm anxious to meet him
But shhh, shhh, just keep it secret
If I join this force would people stop hatin'?
Should I rap like this to join a Roc Nation
Flow cold like I'm rapping while I'm ice skating
Somebody get me an apron, all of my time wasting
I keep it dirty like Chucks, plus I'm a little Gothic
I spit curses and spells and black nail polish
I fuck gypsies and witches, all of my pals' monsters
Smarter than 12 doctors, sharper than nail filers
Call Satan like fuck it, show me how hell look
I take a nun, then I fuck her like a werewolf
I have no heart, no soul, only these spell books
You niggas' bitches and hoes minus the girl looks
I paint pictures with lyrics so y'all can see my thoughts
Now follow me, in my evil voice
Tweet, Young mother fuckin' Money
These my mother fuckin' brothers, not my fuckin' hubbies

[Verse 5: Cory Gunz]
Militia nigga, you know the name
Cory Gunz, remember my pops era, the son of Dame
The fuck is he supposed to call it
The closer the call is, the closer you going
I'm claustrophobic, your swagger is (?)
Mine is poison, I cough a lotus
Walk New York and show this off
Awesome assault aerobics
You could 80 billion chinups, billion dips and a zillion situps
I stomp you where you at, til' you (?) what it was
Keep me from creeping down the strip bored
Hit for it, jigsaw, clip board
Then I rip your bungees at the zip cord
Pardon my lip lord, can I get my (?)
(?)
Goons smoking (?), lining it raw
Who want it with us
Let me know if its beef nigga
I hope you got the coco leaf or clover leaf
Ain't no competing with these
Niggas from boogie to bang bang boogie
Ain't gangbang for chains, stings, cookies and brains hang
Anythang
Anybody looking to bring pain, maintain
Anybody looking to say name, stay sane
Anybody looking to play games
Ain't wild or worthwhile
Nigga just stay tame

[Verse 6: Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Smoke, sex, skate, shoot
Boy we turnt up like breakin' news
Let the kids live, baby, dude
Blood all in the fuckin' baby food
The cradle too, shoot the dog once
Turn around, tell the kids, "Stay in school"
Leave out the house, neighbors peekin' out the windows
Show the pistol to the neighbors and the neighbors move
I don't give a fuck about a nigga's caregiver
I be with them niggas that'll fuck their stepsister
I be with them niggas that'll kill your caregiver
I'll do Brazilian wax on a hair trigger
Lord I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
My pockets on Biggie Smalls
Your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store
I spent about 10 grand
Now the parents wearin' black clothes
And got your homies wearin' shit bags
Think I need a hitman
'Bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don't give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift wrapped
I think I need a hitman
I can't trust the next man
Thank Lord for my weedman
But right now we're playin' phone tag
I'm doin' 40 down the boulevard
I told my homie he gon' take the charge
He got the Tommy and I got the MAC
And on your head they got a contract
I thank you for my hitman
And tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sang "Dear Mama" to my dear mama
And sang "Hit Em Up" to my daddy's bitch ass
I thank you for my hitman
'Bout to go kidnap the big man
As you can see I got big plans
Big plans to be the big man
40 down the boulevard
With my homies, they gon' take the charge
Say, "It's nothin', boy I got your back"
Because them other niggas copy cats
I thank you for my hitman
This for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I'm so sorry for the weight like Slim-Fast
Stick MDMA up a bitch ass
AT&T, ass, tongue and tit man
Oh, oh shit, man
Your pockets on stickman

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
It talk like a killer, it walk like a killer
It must be a killer, I must be a killer
Hustlin' Priscilla straight out of the villa
I got more customers shoppin' at Dillards
Don't fuck with these niggas, I don't know their names
Fuck these niggas, I don't give a damn
Fuckin' with Wayne, Talkin' to Wayne
You talkin' to Wayne is like talkin' to flame
22 pop for a brick in the drought
You can't buy the chicken then please chicken out
Or if you snitchin' we will sniff it out
You'll get found at your house, put your dick in your mouth
Dope, skinny ass sweats
Got a strap wear that bitch on my back
I walk in the mall with that shit on my back
With my bitch hollerin' 'bout, "I want this, I want that"
Ooh, mulah
Like la, la, la, la, la, la Too much Cubana up in me cabana
Too much white china and Columbiana
That Columbiana, Zoë Saldaña
Fuck, hollup
I'll be right back, keep the lights on, baby
Leave the lights on, baby
Them niggas play, they'll get wiped off, baby
Like Lysol, baby
I pull up on a bitch wearin' one .38
Put a bitch nigga on First 48
Fuck a bad bitch in the first 24
She take off all her clothes, say she sorry for the wait
Put her legs on a nigga like a hula hoop
I go between her legs like we shootin' hoops
I break a chicken down to some noodle soup
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru, bitch

[Verse 9: Lil Wayne]
Wait bitch, I've been on
Top of my shit, I've been thinkin' 'bout shit
All this lean in my punch got me lickin' a mothafuckin' fist
Lord please don't let my ice melt
Muhfuck these dog hoes
But this 9 on my right leg
Times get hard, nigga I could sell crack to a white egg
Sell wrong to a right end
Nigga it's Carter time and niggas horrified
It's glorified in this bitch
Prioritized and immortalized
I'm on the borderline and it's thin
Hold up I'm lightheaded like a kite, baby
I might, maybe, get life, baby
My light shady, my rice, gravy
My nights daily, my life's crazy
Lil Tunechi, bitch[Hook: Lil Wayne]
(Yeah ho!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, fuck that nigga, ho ass nigga

Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I walk around with this shotgun
And this bitch bigger than me, nigga

Cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth, nigga
Shoot 'em up then leave, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Keep that ho shit over there
And we don't shoot in the air
I can't fuck with these niggas, man
These niggas gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that muthafucka' hair
It's like man you can't trust nobody
I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck nigga, don't stunt nigga
Don't duck nigga, cause I duck hunt
Bitch rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this muthafucka
That's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room; rushed over
Hollow tips in the clip
My gun loaded, yours sober
I pull yo' card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin forward
I see you got yo' gun drawn
I send you back to the drawin board
Lil Tunechi

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk

See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Walkin' round this mu'fucka limpin'
Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted
Throw ya body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and I'm bodying the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much
Do drive by's and walk ups
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star struck
I don't fuck with the lame niggas
I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nick name is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga, Eastside I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda!

[Bridge: Juicy J]
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law

[Hook: French Montana]
Shorty pull her panties to the side
Told me keep my feelings to the side
For them tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds
Tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds

[Verse 1: Tyga]
She move them panties to the side
She give me head while I drive
These bitches flyin' in like flies
Maybach, no roof, turn a bitch, butterfly
Rose gold in that Autobahn, I'm gettin' money in real time
That big hand on them dollar signs, I'm on west coast rich time
Get punched out for yo' punch lines
These niggas snitchin' like I did the crime
I get the cake like the baker man
No Jamaican kush, that's Beenie Man
These niggas hood-hoppers, don't give a bitch no options
I do this shit for my squadron, ain't got no time for no conference
I call up some real niggas, but they ain't 'bout that talking
I walk in wit' my bitch, fattest ass in the party

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Aye French we in the club way too much, ya know what I'm sayin'?
You know we playing with new bands, homeboy...
Started with a stack, then I got 5 mo' (do it right)
Could have bought a ball team, with all this money I blow
Walk in stalls, cause these hoes know I'm finna go retarded
Balling hard no James Harden, Bentley truck too big to park it (skrrt)
I'ma give her that work, getting head blowing purp
One hand on this blunt, other hand up her skirt
Pussy sweet like apple juice, fuck her til her pussy loose
And when I'm done, pass her to my man, so Ben can see what that pussy do
And she touching herself, what you gone off a molly?
And she thick, and she finer than a mothafucka, looking like tatted-up Holly
Fuck all night no strings attached, say no on love shit, girl this some fun shit
Dick too long and when I lick this spot I'ma make you cum quick

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Tens, twenties, fifties, hunnids

Hands, rubbin, every, time we, doin', numbers (haha)
GT, vodka, all, summer
Yeah, its time to bring them 'raris out
Scratch that, we bringing them Bugattis out

I'm laughin' to the bank, you niggas money funny
I'mma real nigga, you is a counterfeit
Throw a hunnid racks, tell her count it bitch
Money blowin' like a fountain, bitch
All my paper adding up, you only talking shit

[Hook][Intro: Mark Morrison]
Return of the mack (x3)
You know that I’ll be back
Return of the mack (x3)
You know that I’ll be back

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
Today is the day I get out on my feet
Remove them chains, they shackled on me
Press my luck, stop fucking with them hoes that cluck
Cause the same motherfuckers the ones that got me stuck
Tryna use me up ’til my tank on E
Then leave me stranded, scrambling in these streets
For a dollar a day until my pockets is straight
Soon as you move out the hood them niggas hollering you fake
Make ‘em swallow the bass from the Kicker
I’d rather be a dead man than a nigga
I’d rather roll chrome rims than a swisha
I gotta make moves, I can’t hang with ya
That used to be the fly shit back in ’95
But now I want a crib and a car I can drive
And ain’t nobody out there help me cause I’m grown
Gotta leave them childish games alone
Nigga I’m on

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I’m in the hood still praying for a piece of fate
I know he on his way I’m hoping he don’t make it late
I’m up the bat, I just hope I make it to the plate
I’m Babe Truth you can tell ‘em I’m one of the greats
Used to shoot for the stars now my aim lie
I’m the truth nigga something that your name not
A thousand watts ain't a thing that I can’t shine
It ain't a wrist or a chain that I can't rock
Tell ‘em I’m on something like city lights
I used to be out they sights, tinted like city nights
Now a nigga be city to city on plenty flights
You can tell ‘em I put on for my city in plenty fights
Tell ‘em I ain't gon lose they heated like I’m a ?
I’m bout to throw ‘em in this drop with no ceilings so I can fan ‘em
Pull up on the bike same color the Phantom
And jump out on them haters just to tell ‘em I couldn’t stand ‘em

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I’m on top of my game yo
The OG Grand daddy kush, cocaine flow
I’m about that cash not that tango
Head shots, dump a whole clip in ya Kangol
Claim to be a real nigga we know you ain't though
I be in the hood, all the places you can’t go
Visuals, you can see the pictures I paint yo
Residuals, I just put it all in the bank yo, it’s pitiful
Hoes only after your bankroll
Stay off of the phone, watch out for the plain clothes
Yeah I rep my set, I ain't in the gang though
I protect my neck I carry the thing yo
I’m on the same shit that the boss is on
Do it for those in the feds, up north or gone
I’m on a winning streak, I done got my losses on
It’s ironic cause even when I’m off I’m on
Yeah I’m on

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
I’m on
I’m on
I’m on

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Eternally grateful for the support
Made the cover of The Source
Flashback to the ports the city of no remorse
Where they shooting back and forth like they playing horse
May the force be with you, bullet hit you
You bleed and I bleed with you
Mama please when you grieve damn I grieve with you
This a preview I see you in the summer
My new shit dumber, I’m on

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Life at the bottom is devastating
You’re hardly ever debated
The party is obligated
By suckers that wanna be you
And never live with the matrix
And never ever related to struggle and dedication
Your hustle is nominated
Anonymous then you faded
The promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
They vomited everytime that a rapper’s annihilated
Just wish them happy belated
Fuck you I made it, I’m on

[Verse 6: B.o.B]
Tokyo, Amsterdam, Denver to LA
Minutes turn to hours and hours to pay
The days turn to nights but the nights never change
It’s funny time is money used to be a turn of phrase
But now it’s company policy
I’m no spokesperson, no tricks, no gimmicks, no coercion
And they say, "Bob man it’s good to have you back"
But I say, "I’ve been here, where the fuck have yall been at?"

[Verse 7: Tyga]
Thinking how Pac lived at 22 that's ’93
I was four now I’m 22 on tour
One two shots of my life, barely hold on
But I’m drawn to this feeling of adrenaline
With mic’s on, lights on
And they gon’ applaud
Young nigga, Versace they never seen before
And they gon watch me, copy shit that I got on
I’m too fly, I ain't got a flaw
Tell the law we above the law
God bless Amen, every lost soul
And the group so good went solo
Globe trotting, now I’m blowing up like an afro
Nigga thought you knew what I do
Rolling through ya area, double RR coupe
Penthouse level, now we only party on the roof
Bitch I’m a rebel so I move how I wanna move
Last King YMCMB

[Verse 8: Gudda Gudda]
Used to run around the hood picking honeys up
Now I’m doing shows around the world picking money up
Used to be slept on like a pillow
Went from trapping in a rental to rapping on instrumentals
Now its money on my mental
And women get sentimental huh
It’s cause the flow is sweet as a pack of skittles nah
Yellow, gold, yellow diamonds in the middle nah
Stand up nigga, I was never known to sit down

[Verse 9: Bun B]
Well as the world spins around and around on its axis
Boys flip from town to town with the package
Stuffing bills and pounds and browns in a mattress
Sending clowns underground for practice
The fact is everybody wanna be the king with the crown
But never in the battle whent he drama goes down
Easy to be the boss from behind the wall
But we gon see who really goes down when it’s time to brawl
Cause you gotta be careful about the image you portraying
You gotta show love to where you from all day
And when the going gets rough
Dont get to going, get to staying
Put it down for your people
And no delaying know what I’m saying

[Hook][Produced by Chase N. Cashe]

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Too many women and not enough time
I'ma cool cat but I'm on life nine
Pimping ain't dead cause I be the life line
And I don't buy the bar cause it don't sell white wine
Goone let that light shine
Balling for a life time
Smoking on that nice pine
Weezy baby fly fly
You can call him your husband
Call me at night time and even though women change I will always like dimes
And yeah I'm quite fine but shorty much finer
And I just get behind her then smack it like E. Honda
And please don't hate on me when you see me with Kiana
Cause she's wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holla at yo' boy mañana Maybach come wit a recliner
Run up on me and shit will get uglier than an iguana
This is only a reminder, its Young Money don't forget it
And I'm Weezy F baby you might find it on her titty would you

[Hook: Short Dawg]
Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, Gucci sweat pants
She on that jubilee, I'll be the ex-man

Pass me the dutchy with ya left hand
I got the whole club nodding like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be that ex-man

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
Chilling wit my posse 'bout to call some ladies over
Tell them this is YME so when you come you can't leave sober
You would think she came with buttons by the way that I control her
Put her on a tab now she rolling like a baby stroller
I’m the freshest niggas seen, reppin' in my jeans
Shoot your lights out, I’m like Redick with the beam
Life's a game of chess and I'm heading for your queen
Not my stomach and my thighs but her head is in between
She wetter than a stream I drink medicine to lean
Keep a cup in my hand like I'm begging for some cheese
I fall off in the party yeah I'm kinda tardy
But if a hater trip we ride on him like a Harley
Look you call it getting married I call it acting selfish
My belt got G's on it like a packers helmet
And I'mma hit if you bring your girl around
But the weed its like my collar cause I might just turn it down if you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Tool on deck I'm new born fresh
I knock ya friends down and you going next
Young money fly nigga all the bitches after me
Murdered in the bed and you gone be my next casualty
Automatic stick but I give it to her manually
I'm givin dick out year round and you can get it anualy
Styrofoam filled with a strawberry fanta treat
Leaning I'mma need a kick stand to stay on my feet
Get out my business like I kicked ya out my office
I ain't worried bout the price I'm more concerned with the offer
Fresh to death like I got dressed in a coffin
With a party in my pocket blue and red dolphins
I'm high as a motherfucker lemme do my thang bitch
I'm doing me and your girl doin the same shit
I'm in the car getting head as our lanes switch
Double G I do my thang bitch now you could

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Drake]
I told you catch up did you make a mill yet
I can't predict how many of them I can still get
October's Own, its such a fucking real set
No tats but the ink on my money still wet
Life is such a beach it's sandy all around me
I came here with Young Money man that's family all around me
I'm in my living room and I got Grammy's all around me
And famous bitches doing nose candy all around me
Welcome to the life the life is meant for me
My Bentley has a tint and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at your girl that's when she went with me
But please don't blame yourself cause it just wasn't meant to be
They say I'm one of the illest ask yourself for first impressions
And my cards always accepted I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word recession
I don't smoke in public but tonight I'll make an exception so just

[Hook][Verse 1]
I said my necklace iced out, my left wrist iced out
Waka Flocka Flame stay out my lane because I'm thugged out
Niggas getting drugged out, you know what my clique bout
Hit em wit a bottle stomp his motherfucking lights out
Hands on deck make a nigga pull a tool out
Balling this year
I ain't gonna stop until I fall out
Wild out wild out, Gudda Gudda wild out
Wild out wild out, Waka Flocka wild out

[Refrain]
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad

[Bridge]
Waka Flocka get jumped in the club
Gudda, Waka Flocka

[Verse 2]
For the cash I'll wrap a nigga ass up
Run up in his house Jim Carrey-style masked up
We the new Wu-Tang, the new No Limit
The new NWA, what's up Snoop and Dre
Can't forget Eazy-E, Ice Cube's on my neck
Fozzy screaming waka waka bitch I got that check
I don't need no flex but I gotta ball
Money Yao Ming, yes it's that tall
But I'm gutta, gutta
What's up Gudda Gudda
I got rotten apple blood in my veins
I reversed the slave route
I'm from up north to down south
No more mean mugs at my show sshowing green love
Green flags, green love
Su-woo to the people

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money nigga
I'mma rep to the death
You can see the YM tatted on my neck
All my niggas wild choppas on deck
Stomp a nigga out, demand I respect
Me and Waka Flacka got the hand on the tec
And it's cash on delivery so hand me my check
Nigga I don't talk much but when I do bitch pay me
Big money heavy weight, you can ask Baby
Birdman schooled me, Wayne told me do me
And stack big paper up, no need for loose leaf
My rubberband stacks can't fold into knots
I decapitate the top with two hoes in the drop
I'm countin up the money 'til my hands get blisters
Told my bitch to come help me, we can count it up quicker nigga
Real nigga music they talkin we do's it
Free my nigga Weezy and free my nigga Gucci

[Refrain][Verse 1:Nicki Minaj]

Once upon a time there lived the Harajuku Barbie
Use to watch the game in madison square garden
Coliseum block on the weekend Italian
Icces from the Puerto Ricans...
She reps Queens like a crown or a real poofy gown
Or the little white lady out in London
Weeds bridge far rock, southside Jamacia block
Flat-Bush Brooklyn, all of them Jamacian spots
This is my city and I be reppin my city
It's where the giants will tackle you, call a capital avalon
If you come to my city u might see what I mean
It's the city that never sleeps but it's the city of dreams

[Verse 2:Gudda Gudda]

What up uptown, downtown, 6th ward
7th ward, hardheads, west bank, 5th ward
3rd ward, 10th ward, reppin every damn street
Shout out the mighty nine and east 2 Mazant St
Rest in peace son he had Tyra Lan
On lockdown, it's a shame they took him out the game
I see ya CeCe, Nacho, FiFi
Snag Gang, Chuck D, Tallee, T-Streets
That's them Garetti boys, all about the fetti boy
Only think broke 'round here is the levee boy
You know my city nigga, yeah it's real hood
Talk to Turk other day, he doin real good
Hold ya head C, hold ya head mack
Rest in peace Soulja, damn we need You back
Shout out B.G., the whole Chopper City
Cash Money, Young Money, yeah we got the city

[Verse 3: Short Dawg]

Yeah, now lets welcome the Katrina victims
I wasn't there when it happen, but I seen the pictures
So anything my niggas need they can call Short
My arms always opened like Walmart
I moved to the A and promised I'mma be back
I'm still #1 in Houston like T-Mac
Check my sleeve tats, I know you see that
H with a star, syrup pourin over green back
Yeah, and I ain't talking Ms. Buttersworth
So pass me a styrofoam double cup at first
And I'mma pour a four up in that
And sip it till you see me movin slow like I'm fat
This the home of the the candy painted doors on the 'lac
And voices sounding deep as baratone on the track
(Awready) Yeah, we call that screwed
And if u movin too fast we might call that rude (Houston!)[Hook: Detail]
Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that chick was thick, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name
Maybe if I get her attention she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm making my move, you know what I mean
It ought be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
His chid gotta heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bedroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
GTV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at weather yet, so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, "Man, we got next"
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

[Verse 6: Birdman]
Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

[Hook][Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 1 - Gudda Gudda]
I’mma tell these niggas: “motherfuck the world”
On the real, nigga feel this
Punch a hole in the system like I got a steel fist
I don’t trust a soul nigga, so I ride alone
And I’ve been paranoid ever since I got a phone
Yeah, better roll or get rolled over
You too cool nigga? You could get the cold shoulder
I’m from the city where the skinny niggas die
Ride, I survived and I made it out alive
And they wonder why my face look blank
Cause I don’t give a fuck about what they say or think
Uh, nigga you see me with that face wall paint
Come on, pick your poison in the spray of a shake
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
You could meet the devil, better pray for the saints
Militant minded, the way Gudda think
Nigga you could meet the devil…

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement
And a breeze turn to blazes

[Verse 2 - Gudda Gudda]
Starin’ at the world through my rear view
Gotta stay high just so I can keep a clear view
Tryna do right, but I’m swervin’ in the left lane
Tryna stay out of that black hole, watch my step man
They say money is the root of all evil
And we love it, so I guess me and you are all equal
Shit ain’t been the same since Hurricane Katrina
Ike and Rita, what happened with the FEMA?
Government officials not keeping it official
Like a ref with no whistle, so I’m tackling the issues
And they wonder why we act the way we act
Murder, murder, steal, steal, and sell crack to get stacks, but…

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
And I’mma just sit back laughing
And when I tried to kick that habit
Man I was like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
This whole world is aware of my actions
But they ain’t that bad compared to taxes
Ashes, all I see is ashes
As the world burns

[Verse 4 - Mack Maine]
I’m a young arsonist on my late night Johnny Carson shit
I ain’t never gave a fuck about the world
Cause they don’t give a fuck about me, or my girl
Or my mama, in the midst of the drama, ya digg?
They try to pull you all the way back to get ahead of you
Then Internal Revenue gon’ come for your revenue
Sayin’ that you owe 33% of what you make
When the world die, I’mma be rejoicing at the wake

[Bridge - Shanell]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes
One day this world gon’ turn to ashes
So where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?
I blow the flame out, the world is dark now
And everybody need their spark now
And I’m like: “Where’s my matches? Where’s my matches?”
Put the whole world in a casket
And I’m gon’ watch this world just burn to ashes
Turn to ashes, turn to ashes

[Bridge - Lil Wayne]
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
First I check my Rolley
Then say "watch me do it"
Watch me do it, show you how to cook like Martha Stewart
I want some cheesecake I have you walkin' to it
Plus I stack my money tall don't you walk in to it
Just do it all I do is smoke jet fluid
Fuck her with my chain on so my charm can hit her booty
Outrageous with the Louis I'm a fashionaire
Ever since 16 I been a fuckin' thousandaire
They know me by my nickname in the dealership
And all my shows are funeral homes I keep killin' shit
You used to get money so you reminisce
And if yo' bitch get with this she'll get benefits

[Hook: Tyga][Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shooting till my mother fucking hand fall off
Ya track-stars; the gun shot ran y'all off
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss
Shotguns handguns louder than a band drum
You fucking with the drum major don't make me play you the anthem
Bang bang bang bang call it heavy metal
I say bang bang, bitch I make you feel every letter
B.A.N.G. B.A.N.G. G.A.N.G
We spray then leave
We play when we no
We play N-E-

But you can call me Chef Boyardee
Cause I'mma heat this shit

Planet earth is my toilet you're beneath this shit
Then I flush and wipe my ass
Gunslinger like a pass
I cock back and throw a bomb; now Hail Mary
Your tailfary fairytale very frail
And yeah we got them hammers try and hit every nail
Let them sail up the river with that ho shit
Or leave them face down in the fucking ocean
I ain't on no other shit bitch I'm on some more shit
That 'Hello how you doing? I am at your front door shit'
That 'Aww naw he got a gun oh shit. Shit.'...shit

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Okay, it's Young Money what you know about it?
The semi-auto will rip open your body and tear the soul out it
And all that fronting shit nigga I don't know about it
Call me Master J, bitch I'm so about it
Even my ho about it, and don't doubt it
Cause we both would be Angelina and Brad'n
Spazzin' and blastlin', blastin' and rattitatin'
And nah I don't cook but like potatoes I'll mash them
I don't give a fuck about your money or your fashion
Shots through the window of your brand new Ashton
You get out try to run now your chest where them bullets crashin'
Pawn box niggas no crutches no casts
No wheel chair just the two door long black wagon
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me fuck boy don't be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist y'all just some Kung-Fu Pandas
Sweet like Fantas, my blood is the same as Bruce Banners
Hit record on the cameras mother fuck all the bullshitting antics
They saying he ain't gotta get a clearance from Wayne, that's a disadvantage
Being broke is a foreign language for me like Spanish
Musically we direct thrillers, call me John Landis

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
It's the 504 slaughter house blood bath
Little nigga stand tall like a giraffe
One man gang animal, cannibal
Eat rappers for dinner my nickname Hannibal
Guns for days I show you what this cannon do
Hit you split your mothafucking man in two
I grab the chopper South Park that’s how I hold the toy
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
I’m in the streets one deep I can hold my own
And shit, it’s only one seat and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I’m on my crazy ass shit
You see the gun poking out like Sheneneh lips
Watch your lips when talking
Cause I be on grave nigga leaking in your coffin
Rest in piss
When I die, let me rest with clips
Rambo, I’mma go out on my Sylvester shit, bang!(Gudda Gudda)

I'm in my old school new paint new day
All I got is pussy rappers on my food chain
2 Chainz I got on is two pinky rings
Two bitches with me, I need two dingalings
Two G's printed on my shoes and my jeans
Im making noise they can hear me bumpin' over seas

[Hook][Hook: Kid Ink]
Everybody follow me back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom
Follow me, back home
It's a after party full of bad hoes
Bunch of drink, grass smoke
You can do them other drugs in the bathroom

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Cause I'm tryna keep it on the low girl
Breezy, and I'm living in a cold world
Tryna get in, gotta know the code word
And I'll take one, but girl you gotta go first
Whole room moving like a lava lamp
Club full of bad girls, no oxygen
And you know it's going down, Nasdaq
Kobe on the blunt, you gotta pass that
We don't smoke those, you can ash that
I'm in the bathroom hiding from Kat Stacks
Drove here, but I'mma need a cab back
I got my money right, since you comparing that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Yeah, I got they hands up, like a classroom
Can't see me like I got a mask on
Girls straight off the cover of Maxim
It's snow bunnies here, like we in Alaska
White girls, dyke girls
And she told you that she don't even like girls
Lying ass, I make that kitty purr
Since you can bring it back, go on hit reverse
It ain't no grenades, land mines
Gotta blend in, camouflage
You tripping girl, this ain't a Altoid
But it got me feeling like a cocaine cowboy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, money on my mind, what the fuck should I be thinking 'bout?
Purple drank and two Styrofoams is what I'm drinking out
The party's popping, as well as pills, I'm geeked bitch
The whole damn party's outta control, I'm in the bathroom with a freak bitch
Gudda ho, yeah that's my name, don't look at me, look at my chain
Walk in the party, shut down the party then pile the hoes in the black Range
All black tires, I'm the Batman
In the Batmobile, doors up, bat wings
I get a lot of money, what are you doing?
The hoes think I'm crazy, couple screws loose and
I party hard, we ain't sleeping 'til next afternoon
So follow me and swallow me it's a party in the bathroom

[Hook][Verse 1: Tyga]
Rollin' with my "yeah so?" hat to the back
Oh, you ain't heard 'round town? Young nigga strapped
Well Mike, if you lose your life it's no coming back
I've seen lots of lies fake smiles behind my back
Bitch check your chitter-chat
Bruise blues and black
Never trust a loud-mouth, mama taught me that
Don't live the lifestyle, son, if you can't pay for that
But shit you got to spend the money to get money back
And I hurry to the cash, pictures snap
Sirens flash, fuck an officer with a badge
Let's see your license motherfucker that I don't have
Not even half of these niggas have had half of what I had
But I still wish that

[Hook]
If I can leave this place, and just get away
I want to get away (get away)
But I know I see better days
Better days
Better days

[Verse 2: Tyga]
After last weekend, I heard some nigga speaking
About some Tyga beef shit
Like oh, when I see him
I live a landslide occur when deers run
By in herds, bitches tweakin'
Forgetting the seasons
Lames not in my lane
Got heat for little Heathens
I rise over them like Christ in A.D
It's a prayer visual as I murder the spiritual
Walking in hell's kitchen
Slow bitches standing on they tippy-toes
Sounds like what great things should sound like
Tyga fly though with no kite, vanilla sky
Don't need a mask this is my disguise
Her eyes saying color is mine
I done seen water cry

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, I'm in search for a better day
I put my mind in the clouds and try and get away
And I know I don't talk to the Lord much
Cause my mind racing thoughts moving like a tour bus
And niggas hatin', I try not to endure such
Cause the only thing I fear is me and the Lord trust
Everything I speak about, I really mean it nigga
I'm on my hustle I'm a Young Money greedy nigga
Believe it, nigga
It's a light at the end of the tunnel
If you don't see it take the scenic, nigga
I remember being broke on several days
Now I'm living out my dreams
Better days

[Hook][Verse 1: Tyga]
First of all I ain't feeling y’all
Feel the fucking heat defrost
Fill the spoon full of food
Ain't enough to feed the room
I don’t have to goon, twizla boy split you to
Cherry red Rover roof
Crips to confuse you
You can say I blue’s you
Better than I bruised you
All you niggas copycats doing shit I used to
Oh you tatted too, nigga fuck you
My bitch ain't got no tatts I hit her from the back
I spend south of France all that other shit is wack
Sling shot it in the ear than I let the shit collapse
Money is my pet peeve, give me hourly
If there is none at all, than I’m pissed off
I listen to Rick Ross and I know Ricky Ross
I’m Leonardo in Inception, reserve my section
I do dreams put you in a bubble, benz or Lexus
I Will Smith the necklace, I do it effortless
Bitch all eyes on me
The future’s in my eyes
Bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga jealous than the muthafucker dies
Figure you ain't scary if you did the crime
Now prepare its dinnertime
Dimmer the lights, lemon with ice
Look it at twice its fizzling sprite
Brown do the belly nice
No coca cola, I don’t drink soda
Black beenie nigga, like a fucking smoker
They say I’m bout to blow up like super nova
Put your helmet on, the bulldozing dopest
How you shitting on ‘em and ain't got shit on ‘em
It kills me to know it, you Melanie Fiona
Ohhh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Ohhh, remove yourself, remove yourself
Ohhh, remove yourself from my scrotum
Pull your whole car I thought I told youNo Ceilings, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Nice tires on the Ghini, you should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable, zucchini
I live on the beach, she walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school, and I cut ‘em like seniors
I’m here to distinguish,the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap, get some money in between it
Glocks like police, pumps like fenas
This beat getting totalled, Pam, Keisha, Kima
Sitting on the World, thinking 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party
Ha-Ha Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big, bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib cause it's five floors
I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors
Life’s a bitch, now die for her

[Verse 2: Short Dawg]
I have the type of flow niggas don’t have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write
The way I’m eating niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like Applewhite
I pour four then I hit the exit door
Take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor
Hood smell the scent of money coming out my pores
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, boy
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes
Young Elvis Freshley, yes he flyer than the stork
Dropping babies off in your chicks cheek, kicks neat
Got your son looking up to me like I’m 6 feet
Your daughter need someone to save her, not me
I’m knocking hoes down like Laila Ali
Try heat and I'mma put the toaster to your kidney
Then I pull off in a Bentley, top open like a chimney
It’s no ceilings like a Coliseum
Candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhoea
The way I'm leaning I'm annoyed if I stand still
Flow harder than an anvil
Short

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Ok, its Gudda ho
All about my bills like buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets, I heard she was an undercover ho
Purple got me moving slow, like I’m in a snail race
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head, then I pick up my shell case
Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a young money goon
Your girl like a motion picture she gon’ be coming soon
I do a certain rule, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Mills then drop her off to Tune
Couple screws lose, you don't want to play with him
This is No Ceilings bitch, roofless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in your club well nigga pay us then
All grey BM, I’m getting it for my baby M
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
Don’t play no games ho
You know my name ho
G-U-D-D-A propane flow[Verse 1]
I said my necklace iced out, my left wrist iced out
Waka Flocka Flame stay out my lane because I'm thugged out
Niggas getting drugged out, you know what my clique bout
Hit em wit a bottle stomp his motherfucking lights out
Hands on deck make a nigga pull a tool out
Balling this year

Wild out wild out, Gudda Gudda wild out
Wild out wild out, Waka Flocka wild out

[Refrain]
Young Money, Bricksquad

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
For the cash I'll wrap a nigga ass up
Run up in his house Jim Carrey-style masked up
We the new Wu-Tang, the new No Limit
The new NWA, what's up Snoop and Dre
Can't forget Eazy-E, Ice Cube's on my neck
Fozzy screaming waka waka bitch I got that check
I don't need no flex but I gotta ball
Money Yao Ming, yes it's that tall
But I'm gutta, gutta
What's up Gudda Gudda
I got rotten apple blood in my veins
I reversed the slave route
I'm from up north to down south
No more mean mugs at my show sshowing green love
Green flags, green love
Su-woo to the people

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money nigga

You can see the YM tatted on my neck

Stomp a nigga out, demand I respect
Me and Waka Flacka got the hand on the tec
And it's cash on delivery so hand me my check
Nigga I don't talk much but when I do bitch pay me
Big money heavy weight, you can ask Baby
Birdman schooled me, Wayne told me do me
And stack big paper up, no need for loose leaf
My rubberband stacks can't fold into knots
I decapitate the top with two hoes in the drop
I'm countin up the money 'til my hands get blisters
Told my bitch to come help me, we can count it up quicker nigga
Real nigga music they talkin we do's it
Free my nigga Weezy and free my nigga Gucci

[Refrain][Verse 1]
Long clip hanging out that P95, Ruger cocked
We mobsters, catch you eating that pasta knock your noodle out
I'm from New Orleans, East Side where make a nigga kill you for a bag of dope
When the drought comes we selling soap, we selling dreams, we selling hope
Assault rifle with a telescope, I can hit a nigga from long distance
Peyton Manning, strong precision, two arms stroking like I'm going swimming
Whats wrong with them, they sleeping on me, I'ma start handing out pillows nigga
Then use the same pillow to muzzle the shot coming of my pistol nigga
Get your issue, and I ain't talking about magazines to read to

Lethal weapon I'm Danny Glover, shoutout my nigga, Thugga Thugga
Choppas in the backseat, but where I'm from we call em cutters

Ridin round bumpin Soulja Slim while my young niggas snort a bag of dope

But I'm staying loyal to my own crew
Young Money Cash Money, bank accounts on overload

Can't trust a pig, informant nigga, run the cop wired
They set us up, then book me up, you crooked fuck
Get to the jail, tell them bitches to look me up
I'm on top of my shit, Red Bottoms like how my shoe tastes
Standin' from where I'm at, the licro is my shoe lace
I chunk a deuce, pour a four all inside an eight ounce
I'm faded now, finna cut a ho off like K Camp
TMZ on my dick, they swear they can knock me off, shit
Harvey better chill 'fore niggas run in his office
Write our own article, tell the people who caused it
Faggot tried to hide, first spot we shot is the closet
Crazy mothafucka, Mossberg in the moshpit
Ever since I hit LA, I'm wildin' on my Pac shit
B.I.G., "Who Shot" shit, or Jay on his Roc shit
"Wop Wop," "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Block Is Hot" shit

[Verse 2: Hood]
Fat Fly Nigga, landing on your runway
Got the work coming, I'm the black Mickey Monday
Snowflake fresher than the morning on a Sunday
I ain't a killer but my homie with the gun play
He the typa kid go to school and kill the lunch La-dy
Damn, crazy right? We the typa kids live a crazy life
We get money, fuck bitches, rock crazy ice
And it's Young Money Records, ho, I'm really with D'wayne
In the club drunk trippin' yelling "Bitch, I'm Mack Maine!"
Boy's insane, top down in the rain
Holding up traffic, shootin' dice in your lane
Niggas shot me in my back, but I'm back bro
No we not a Jack boy, we done jacked bro
Started sellin' crack, now a nigga sellin' crack flows
Meet me in the trap, I'll be right by the back door
You can get a Bow Wow, you can get a Fat Joe
You can get finessed, I'm from Dallas, boy, it's natural
You can get it all for a real pretty penny
Niggas in the hood cookin' chickens, eatin' Denny's
Hoody

[Verse 3: Euro]
Compare me to who? Compare me to what?
Compare me to them, I'm 100, I'm not like them
I'm talkin', been hustlin' before I seen her
Rick Ross video in that off-white Beamer
I'm at the bar taking shots of nightmares with dreamers
Shoot for the stars, hope the moon ain't [?]
Stepped in the game and I spit that ether
And I ain't leaving 'til I blow, funny, these hoes ain't either
Listen, it's February, leaves enough time for me
So by December, I should be a millionaire at least
The least, take my word, this the year I beast
And if not, y'all can kill me by New Years Eve, please

[Verse 4: Flow]
Rollin' blunts while I'm listening to my Jigga disc
Smokin', flickin' ashes from the tip of the pyramid
Dressed in black growing up, horns for my membership
White kid listened to my song then he slit his wrist
I have a nightmare to stop you niggas from dreaming
I never read the bible, but I watch angel and demons
The devil after me? Well fuck it, I'm anxious to meet him
But shhh, shhh, just keep it secret
If I join this force would people stop hatin'?
Should I rap like this to join a Roc Nation
Flow cold like I'm rapping while I'm ice skating
Somebody get me an apron, all of my time wasting
I keep it dirty like Chucks, plus I'm a little Gothic
I spit curses and spells and black nail polish
I fuck gypsies and witches, all of my pals' monsters
Smarter than 12 doctors, sharper than nail filers
Call Satan like fuck it, show me how hell look
I take a nun, then I fuck her like a werewolf
I have no heart, no soul, only these spell books
You niggas' bitches and hoes minus the girl looks
I paint pictures with lyrics so y'all can see my thoughts
Now follow me, in my evil voice
Tweet, Young mother fuckin' Money
These my mother fuckin' brothers, not my fuckin' hubbies

[Verse 5: Cory Gunz]
Militia nigga, you know the name
Cory Gunz, remember my pops era, the son of Dame
The fuck is he supposed to call it
The closer the call is, the closer you going
I'm claustrophobic, your swagger is (?)
Mine is poison, I cough a lotus
Walk New York and show this off
Awesome assault aerobics
You could 80 billion chinups, billion dips and a zillion situps
I stomp you where you at, til' you (?) what it was
Keep me from creeping down the strip bored
Hit for it, jigsaw, clip board
Then I rip your bungees at the zip cord
Pardon my lip lord, can I get my (?)
(?)
Goons smoking (?), lining it raw
Who want it with us
Let me know if its beef nigga
I hope you got the coco leaf or clover leaf
Ain't no competing with these
Niggas from boogie to bang bang boogie
Ain't gangbang for chains, stings, cookies and brains hang
Anythang
Anybody looking to bring pain, maintain
Anybody looking to say name, stay sane
Anybody looking to play games
Ain't wild or worthwhile
Nigga just stay tame

[Verse 6: Gudda Gudda]

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Smoke, sex, skate, shoot
Boy we turnt up like breakin' news
Let the kids live, baby, dude
Blood all in the fuckin' baby food
The cradle too, shoot the dog once
Turn around, tell the kids, "Stay in school"
Leave out the house, neighbors peekin' out the windows
Show the pistol to the neighbors and the neighbors move
I don't give a fuck about a nigga's caregiver
I be with them niggas that'll fuck their stepsister
I be with them niggas that'll kill your caregiver
I'll do Brazilian wax on a hair trigger
Lord I think I need a hitman
Tell Biggie I'm a big fan
My pockets on Biggie Smalls
Your pockets on stickman
I just came from the gun store
I spent about 10 grand
Now the parents wearin' black clothes
And got your homies wearin' shit bags
Think I need a hitman
'Bout to go kidnap a rich man
If he don't give it up we chop him up
And send his body parts to his house gift wrapped
I think I need a hitman
I can't trust the next man
Thank Lord for my weedman
But right now we're playin' phone tag
I'm doin' 40 down the boulevard
I told my homie he gon' take the charge
He got the Tommy and I got the MAC
And on your head they got a contract
I thank you for my hitman
And tell Pac I'm a big fan
I sang "Dear Mama" to my dear mama
And sang "Hit Em Up" to my daddy's bitch ass
I thank you for my hitman
'Bout to go kidnap the big man
As you can see I got big plans
Big plans to be the big man
40 down the boulevard
With my homies, they gon' take the charge
Say, "It's nothin', boy I got your back"
Because them other niggas copy cats
I thank you for my hitman
This for all my fans that been fans
I'm so sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I'm so sorry for the weight like Slim-Fast
Stick MDMA up a bitch ass
AT&T, ass, tongue and tit man
Oh, oh shit, man
Your pockets on stickman

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
It talk like a killer, it walk like a killer
It must be a killer, I must be a killer
Hustlin' Priscilla straight out of the villa
I got more customers shoppin' at Dillards
Don't fuck with these niggas, I don't know their names
Fuck these niggas, I don't give a damn
Fuckin' with Wayne, Talkin' to Wayne
You talkin' to Wayne is like talkin' to flame
22 pop for a brick in the drought
You can't buy the chicken then please chicken out
Or if you snitchin' we will sniff it out
You'll get found at your house, put your dick in your mouth
Dope, skinny ass sweats
Got a strap wear that bitch on my back
I walk in the mall with that shit on my back
With my bitch hollerin' 'bout, "I want this, I want that"
Ooh, mulah
Like la, la, la, la, la, la Too much Cubana up in me cabana
Too much white china and Columbiana
That Columbiana, Zoë Saldaña
Fuck, hollup
I'll be right back, keep the lights on, baby
Leave the lights on, baby
Them niggas play, they'll get wiped off, baby
Like Lysol, baby
I pull up on a bitch wearin' one .38
Put a bitch nigga on First 48
Fuck a bad bitch in the first 24
She take off all her clothes, say she sorry for the wait
Put her legs on a nigga like a hula hoop
I go between her legs like we shootin' hoops
I break a chicken down to some noodle soup
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru
I buy a Rolls Royce like a Subaru, bitch

[Verse 9: Lil Wayne]
Wait bitch, I've been on
Top of my shit, I've been thinkin' 'bout shit
All this lean in my punch got me lickin' a mothafuckin' fist
Lord please don't let my ice melt
Muhfuck these dog hoes
But this 9 on my right leg
Times get hard, nigga I could sell crack to a white egg
Sell wrong to a right end
Nigga it's Carter time and niggas horrified
It's glorified in this bitch
Prioritized and immortalized
I'm on the borderline and it's thin
Hold up I'm lightheaded like a kite, baby
I might, maybe, get life, baby
My light shady, my rice, gravy
My nights daily, my life's crazy
Lil Tunechi, bitch[Intro]
And this is just a mixtape, Damn
(Well it's a little more than that, It's more like a message. More like a change for the better)

Young veteran, soon to be O.G
Plus I spit like a crack head with no teeth

[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]
Willie the kid pull guns like a hamstring
No bull I push pro Vs like Pantene
Blow like a trombone
Funny niggas tambourine
Players get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearers
And my niggas on paper getting paper like ball players
No blood no foul, ya my heart cold as moscow
We NAPA killin like a hot towel
All my hoes hostile
Not me, never tell me "not now"
Rap niggas forty cal to your brow
Roof remover
We leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a moist chair

You rappers should be tired o' lyin'
But I know its hard like a tire iron
But yet it's complex like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math

Nobodies fly as this

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
They say powder makes you hyper
Reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give u cancer
Well wounds make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot
Thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave
Upside down blood rushing to they head
They reacting off sound as I stand on the mound
Pitchin for the crown
Uptown bound face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters
Proverbs leviticus
Old ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip
Soundin like some bitches hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick
Its ridiculous the new school nigga
What you need to do is become a resident
Under the condition
Get your ass up off your ass
And get your ass up on a mission
Become some competition
Like Federer and Nadal
Young money nigga we ball
Like Kobe or Chris Paul
For giving a whack cracker
Still sipping Cristal
Wavin the lifeline
Since lifes a bitch y'all
Raising up the skirts of jezzebels
For no cash like
"bitch give me that ass"
Or pulling up to the lot like
"give me that jag"
No pulling up to the lot like
"give me that lam"
They study me, yeah
They cram like im a final exam
If I hit you in your back
You'll need a spinal exam
Im something like a rhino or ram
Animal,beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia,yeast
YM militia you niggas better retreat

R.I.P. deceased

Nikes on they neck, they like let me breathe
Im sorry but I can't this is how we feed
This is why we hot
This is how we freeze
To fast to follow
This is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave
You know we tote steal, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves now
Pass me the swisher let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't this is why we Bs
This shit like pudding, putting it down like gravitys pulling
Putting it down like gravitys pulling
Putting it down like gravitys pulling me to the ground

More money, more bitches
More work, more haters, equals more snitches
More digits, no, more commas
Me affiliated with trendsetters equals more drama
Weezy Obama, that's my co-signer
You see Osama, in my persona
Steamin' like a sauna, sick I need a doctor
Stab you fore I drown you, now you just another red lobster
Where the bitches at? I need a head doctor
Nice thick & red bitch you fuckin' with a top shot-ah
Top dolla, nigga Young Money

All black whips, all red flags

Real niggas listen, when I'm preachin' to em'
Now we all know money talks, cause I'm speakin' to em'

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Uh-Umm, but I ain't speakin' to em
I call my guns jumpers cause my bullets just leapin' to 'em
All you boys bustas, so soft, bet the wind blew em'

Got a bitch who won't stop till everyone of us get laid
Lot of you niggas is son of a bitch made

And I tote that can opener, don't make me bust your 7 up
Heaven up, hell down, man down, gal down
And I keep that hammer do you wanna get nailed down?
Better kneel down, cause I am the god
I am the hardest mothafucka to try it before
My diet is ya'll, I riot and war
Fightin' 'em all, bitin' 'em all, giant or small, I am a dog
I can smile at dumb bitches and brighten 'em all
I am a hog, ridin' 'em all
I just lay that pipe and I'm off
Call me plumber, and give your girl my number, hombre
I am a bumble, bee on a humble
Your girlfriend want my pickle and my cucumber
Tell your boyfriend I'll turn him to a vegetable
Break a nigga down to a decimal, I'm tellin' you
I'm very cool, unless a fool, fuckin' up my revenue
I tote that whatever dude, I shoot at whatever dude
Just bought a Lamborghini Murcielago
And my girl from the bay say it's "hella cool"
Wheres the helipad? my helicopter land
I shot the man, if I'm not the man
Do I go in, or I go in, I'm not your friend, I'm not your kin
I make your brain come out your chin
Been in the game since the begnnin'
Im all about winnin'
I look down I see them, when I look up I don't see any

One named Nina and that yapper my side bitch
We size niggas up so wisely choose who you side with
Got something on my side that pack a kick – that’s my sidekick
I’m about that paper, roll the dice and get paid
And they can’t bite the hand I’m feeding with, I’m holding grenades
So I’mma talk my shit, I’mma live my life

Money don’t make itself

I should probably see a shrink but I’m afraid he’ll make me little
I’ve been a beast since I could remember
I got too many hoes, that’s my dilemma
Chop yo fuckin head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get em, I got Mike Banger on the beat, I got this banger on display

Got a billion bitches, I’m lookin for the one that got away
And since all these niggas watching, ask them for the time of day

Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious, fuck
Hi, my name is Tune, it’s nice to eat ya
I still keep that gun like a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it?
Boy I have the people looking for you like a reason uh
You don't want to hit my blunt cause I been eating pussy all day
This gun got a hair trigger, I pull this bitch til it’s bald head
Ye ain’t got no bars nigga

Can’t kill me, I was born dead
Crowned of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head

And that trash bag, they find you arm leg leg leg arm head
Oh what a tangled web we weave I feel like daddy long legs
Hop out that Ferrari Spider for my boys at Rikers and all my lifers
My bitch say my dick is great
But I make her say it like Tony the Tiger
I own a rifle and I’m on the edge
I bop bop and I’m ridin off
I’m devastation, I’m Freddy Jason, Dedication 5, 5 stars
TunechiDevil in my ear, I hear him whispering, kill em all, kill em all
Devil in my ear I hear him whispering, whispering, whispering
Kill em all, kill em all

[Hook: Gudda Gudda]
Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering, whispering
So I ask the lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart please
I’m praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
What’s the time on my audemar, fuck the time cause I can die tomorrow
Popping mollies like tylenol, waiting around for my final call
Niggas try to homicide me yo, get believe that my 9 are draw
East side it’s the riders dog, if you ask what happened, I’ll deny it all
Lord keep me from trigger squeezing, when I feel the reason
When it’s killing season, when I feel the breeze
It means I’m shooting when the wind blow, long as all my enemies are breathing
3 am I’m in nail PC, and heard a nigga ruger bang, throwing shots at me
They comin right back (chea)
Let's call that: boomerang
I’m laying in my bed, last night just keeps playing in my head
Walked in the rest room to check my flash room
Thinking next time they gonna lay a nigga dead
Yeah crook they gonn steal your life, devil in my ear with the ill advice
He say kill em twice, I’m praying to god, while I’m holding on to my 3.80 for real

[Hook: Gudda Gudda]
Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering, whispering
So I ask the lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart please
I’m praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for you, hear that

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
No breakfast this morning, count up a million
No daddy for goddess, I make my decisions
I cop me a tars, one hustler’s ambition
I stay on my grizzly, you was washing them dishes
I was chasing that money, you was chasing them bitches
While my mama was struggling, I provided it on with it
Know the lord be my witness, killer show no forgiveness
2 many these loyal niggas, that was just keep fucking with me
I’m paranoid, I’m sinning, no kind of love for bitches
Niggas I know be hating, I count my filthy riches
Pray for them hoes women, casket for guilty snitches
Pray for my enemies, the problem is my chopper dick

[Hook Gudda Gudda]
Devil in my ear, I hear him whispering, whispering
So I ask the lord to get rid of him
Keep him out my mind and out my heart please
I’m praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for my enemies, praying for my enemies
Praying for you, hear that

[Verse 3: Trae tha truth]
Devil so close, heaven is so far, father forgive me I’m about to take them to war
Ready to ride, chopper loaded, hop out the course

Niggas want me dead, praying I wouldn’t breathe
10 toes down, I told them I wouldn’t be leaving
Soon as I hit the lights, somebody fin to be grieving
What’s up that… I told them I wouldn’t leave it
All fuck niggas get dead or get gone, I send them at your head for they…
Ain’t nobody to call, step with no phone, king of the streets
I’ve been there for so long
Bitch I’m on the throne, I would never bow down
If you want beef, I was gonna jump down
Certified stiff, I would never fall down, I’m an asshole till tomorrow

I pray somebody get my enemies out of reach, fuck a grave
I’ma put them in the sand on the beach
When the old school doors open up…no peace
You can tell that everything gets breached
I’m ahead…stick it to them like a leech, check my stats bitch
I’m a cheeve…running through anything like certified freaks

[Hook]

[Verse 4: gudda gudda]
I can hear them whispers, cup full of hard liquor
Telling me to pick that clipper, making flame till I hick up
Lord on my right shoulder, devil on my left
Hearing voices in my head everytime I take a step
He says, kill em all, grab the gun and kill em all
And if you do this deed then I’ll lead you through the fog
The lord is in my other ear and this is what he say
My son if you follow him, you walk amongst the dead, pray

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Fear god and no man, I’m a man of respect
But I can kill like… I can gamble with your life, can you gamble with the debt

[Hook][Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I like a long haired, thick red-bone
Open up her legs, then Filet Mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick,now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
But you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohh-oh-ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
(And bitch I'm Mack Maine...)
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie (hah) D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzle... baby
Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world [x5]
Young Mula, baby[Hook]
Your so extraordinary
Something’s got a hold on me
Your so extraordinary
Somethings who’s got a hold on me
If this feeling has emotion..
Someone who’s got a hold on me

[Gudda Gudda - Verse 1]
Rumble anyday nigga pick a date
I’m feeling great, I don’t walk I just levitate
I come from the bottom of the slum village
Where niggas make a name for being young killers
I hate the game and all the bullshit that come with it
Sometimes I wanna get the money and be done with it
But right now I’m feeling better than the usual
Flow so ugly make my bank account beautiful
They call me Gudda nigga who is you
Bedrocking every girl was a 2 for 2
That’s right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extraordinary, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We took the game to another level
Killing all these rap niggas time to get the shovel
I don’t want this shit I want this shit forever
Until the game crown me king like Ms Corretta
Yeah. Chase the money with my eyes open
Cause I’ma die trying and never die hoping
Shit about to get critical
It's Guddaville 2, and the first one was biblical
Fuck the bullshit I’ma leave these niggas miserable
Spit the hardest shit till I start to see residuals
That’s right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Propane thoughts; I spit gasoline
I be the first to come and the last to leave
Some of the realest shit I ever spoke
I hope your hearing everyline and catching every quote
Flow sick there’s no antidote
Lock me in the zoo. They can’t tame me: I’m an animal
There’s no stopping me. there’s no holding me
There’s no games nigga. there’s no controlling me
I know the Lord watching over me
Had to get the snakes from around me so it’s more for me
That’s right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga
