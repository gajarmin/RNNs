[Intro: Lil' Wayne]
It's a major move right here baby
You gotta get with it or get lost, you understand

[Intro: Lloyd]
Yeah, it's Young Lloyd reporting live from Atlanta, Georgia
Weezy F. Baby, Decatur where it's greater
And uh, I want all my sexy ladies to report to the dance floor immediately
We gon' Golden Glide this one y'all, speak Weezy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Right off the back ma, the boy got dollars
So women come frequent like flight mileage
It ain't no secret I, I might holla
But I ain't gonna sweat ya, baby I'mma let'cha
Catch up with your game, run faster
Don't let him lose you cause I ain't gon' bless you
Unless ya, feelin a little desperate
Send a nigga a text message, girl

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Stop, wait a minute
The way you move that girl
You done got my heart all in it
And I just wanna be with you tonight
Girl please, I'm a player that is true
But I change the game for you
I wanna see what it do

[Hook: Lloyd]
Can I be for real, this is how I feel
I'm in need of love, so let's dip up out of here
Ooh you just my type, everything so right
And I just wanna chill, so let's dip up out of here
Let's dip up out of here
(Ahhhh) She's fine too, but I want you
(Ahhhh) She's fine too, but I want you

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
I’ll admit it
This just ain't no game
These just ain't words, that I'm spitting
If you could see the thoughts that's in my head
I'm a player, yeah is true
But I'll change the game for you
I wanna see what it do

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, Weezy F. Baby, the key to the ladies
Keys to the 'cedes but please say the baby
Weed and Patrón, even in the A.M
We should be alone, we can get a date in
You like what I'm saying then come around the way and
We can go inside and stay in
Tell the homeboy you staying, you've been taken
Gone, turn me on and I'mma turn him down
You know I love you like cooked food
You know you fucking with a good dude
You know you give good brain like you graduated from a good school
You know I'm a good move, you should do
Me, so hey shorty what it is
Tha Carter who it is, and shorty do it big
A party at my crib, that's a party in the hills
You call it what you want, cause she can call it what she feel
Ow!

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I ain't nothing but a nonviolent nigga, ya know what I mean?
Me and lil' Lloyd long hair don't care
Yo what up Ryan I see you baby (yeah)
It's a major move right here baby
I ain't talking fast it's just you listenin' slow, ya know what I mean?
You ain't tryna hear me then don't heard me, I'm up outta hear
I ain't being mean but you so mean in them jeans, ya know what I mean?
So what you want me to do?[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life , nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Up early in the morning, got gold in my eye
Got a 4-5 that'll leave a hole in the sky
Sittin at this table, why, to take this {?}
Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side (riiiight)
Hoes used to call me small time
My clothes ain't know what to call mine
No logos or no tags in it
No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it
Way before my first key
My nigga E showed me
How to parlay a Z (good lookin' nigga)
I know my mama pullin' overtime
Pocket full of dimes
So I'm out here pullin' mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
You can't close shop, not on my block
I'm 24/7 like IHOP
Came from the bottom to the skybox
Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top
Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me
Fifty grand in a band, I'mma roll it homie
Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub
Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud
Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta
I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper
Just an example, by an ex-trapper
Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes
Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose
Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everything
I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days
This life and nothin' will ever change that
I love the game and we'll never give the game back
We lost a lotta good niggas in the game
But in the game, all the good niggas get a name
I got a name, everybody don't die the same
Like all dope don't fly the same
M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them thangs
It's like the people want me to come fly the plane

[Hook] - 3X[Hook: Lloyd]
Ain't nothin' but the street life
