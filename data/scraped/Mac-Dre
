I'm out of this world, not your run of the mill'n
My name is furl I'm the owner of the building
I'm a stoner and I'm chillin with two bitches like Jack
I pimps and I mack drive a Benz and a 'lac
Man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars
I've been out front with the thugs and the guards
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia
And I only run with niggas that'll kill and die for ya
I'm popular, I'm a rap star
But I live like a rock star running from the cop cars
I drop bars wit slaps that Knock hard and I charge for this dick extra large
I'm sicker than SARS higher than Mars and I treat my bitch like an ATM card

[Hook: repeat 4X]
I'm in the buildin and I'm feelin myself
Man I'm feelin myself

She's in the buildin and she's feelin herself
She's lookin bad man I'm willing to help
Stop it baby you're killin' yourself
Come on I got your back you could chill in my Delt'
I'm feelin myself too
Man just imagine some of the things we can do
You under me
Me under you
Then we can catch the Liquor store before 2
We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms
And if you still want to kick it we can go get a room
It won't cost you much, I'm a good buy
Dick-on-discount? bitch good bye!
What do I look like Mr. Frank Fuck for Free
No dough ho? You can't fuck with me
Get the fuck out
Bitch you still in my Delt'
You full of shit and I'm feelin' myself

[Hook]

I'm a West Coast Bad Boy
I represent it
"Dre, that's a bad toy, is it rented?"
Hardy har har very funny
You don't hear my tummy
I gets my money
My stomach ain't growlin
I'm stylin' and wildin', drinkin' Vodka straight fuck a Long Island
I want my own Island bet you I'm a get it
I switch hit and play with both mitts
Pack a four-fifth I'm after your bitch
He ain't doing it right she's after your scritch
And I'm after hers with these macking words, nerd
I thought squares, stayed sharp
You're nothing but a mark in a bucket Skylark
I'm playing my part
I'm Mr. Furly
Quit interrupting I'm talkin' to your girly

[Hook][Verse 1]
Dre rock the jewelry with the clear stones
Get on a nigga head like some headphones
I finna spit it with a clear tone
Get your attention
The biggest thing since the TV invention
Dope as Zoloft, I'm a big shot, a show off
Plus, I'm a big pimp, I get tore off
Fuck a good job, she need a good jaw
To sell BJs 'til her mouth get raw
I'm from the California coast, beaches and bridges
Hit the cot, get ghost, I don't be sleeping with bitches
I got a Cougnut, sitting on wires
Vogues, bitch, not Michelin tires
Can't control my desires
I buy from Nordstrom's, not Fred Meyer's
I do a lot of weed, love my supplier
She keep it, fuck the blood out my supplier
Man, I'm bigger than life, I do it Magnum
And 'bout these broke bitches, I'm through with having 'em
Dre bogard, he shove and he push
And start a war for nothing like G.W. Bush
We be loving the kush, but only in the Backwood
Without a Backwood, weed ain't all that good
I'm from the streets, where most need heat
But I'll slice a nigga up like some roast beef meat

[Hook]
I can bust you a rap, but anything else, not my job
I'll peel your cap back, but anything else, not my job
I'll get you for racks, but anything else, not my job
I'll make you a slap, but anything else is not my job

[Verse 2]
Bitch gonna ask me to come with her to grocery shop
I told her straight up like this, no siree bop
That's not my job, I don't do that
I'm a pimp slash rapper, I thought you knew that
And where your dude at, should I serve him the news
And let him know he finna be walking in some brand new shoes
Ooh, you a fool, gotta watch thyself
One false move and can't stop thyself
Sometimes I'm not myself, I'm another man
I'm a rockstar, in another band
Plus, I'm the man with the plan in his hands
Soon, we'll be all playing in sand
Cause to my estimations and these calculations
And all the money I made off the rompilations
I'm finna get as many digits that's on a license plate
I shit on some of these midgets, bitch, I can't wait

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When I dip, they trip off what Furl dressed in
Plus, I got a mouth full of girl's best friend
I'm a Back to the Future, new game kind of nigga
Y'all lames is plain, drinking the same kind of liquor
Wearing the same kind of clothes, fucking the same kind of hoes
And you Bedrock pimping, meaning your game's kind of old
You don't want it with me, I'll bother ya
So get lost, pal, before I clobber ya
I got golden gloves, I give you a new look
With a stiff left and a sharp right hook
Niggas know snitches, they ride and they go with them
It's all gravy, as long as they don't tell on them
Me and my team, see, we a machine
You fuck with my mans, and I'ma have to intervene
I'm a sport coat and a sancho, always looking out for Benny BlancoWhen we pull up to the light, the people all stare
Four niggas in the Benz with the dreadlock hair
Smoke everywhere, wavin at Madeline
On them woodgrain Davins with the license plate rattlin'
Doin what we want to, hangin out the sunroof
Mental, we ignorant, boy we go dumb dude
Gas break dip, we call it yokin'
Do a donut in yo whip, we call it dosin'
Get stupid, is what we do good
Ghost ride the whip while we dancing on the hood
I'm amped feeling good, p I'm hyphy
In a bitch face with a thizz face off a Nike
The women like me, im dipped in butta
I'll rob your brotha pimp the blood out your motha
I'm mister stupid doo doo dumb
Sumthin Terrible, tell em how we come

[Hook]
We go S - T - U - P - I - D
When we go to the club we dont need ID
Everywhere we go its a party yall
We gon get it crackin like the Mardi Gras
Get stupid [4x]
Go stupid [3x]
Come and go stupid with me

[Verse 2]
I'm a dog, hound, Crestside clown
Gig so hard make my pants fall down
This beat pounds, cutty where'd you get it?
Oh you ain't know, Dr. Dre did it

I come wit it, rappin and rhymin
Dancin, pantomimin, actin like im drivin
Then switch it up, dance like im fishin
See in the bay area we dance a lil different
The bay bounce to thizzle, the west coast wizzle
Do the get stupid, come fuck with Drizzle
Call the hospital, he's having convulsions
No he's gettin stupid, in his load yokin
Is the store still open?
We need Heem, that Privelege thing...yadadamean?
All in the throw like yee
S - T - U - P - I - D

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Allright, let me tell you why we call this thing stupid
Cause when I dance the chicks say "you stupid"
You can do it, it ain't that hard
Baby get dumb, act like a retard
Shake ya hair, make it blow in the air
You gotta get into it, growl like a bear
Now say whaaa! "what?" no whaaa!
Do the damn thing girl cut that shit up
Fill ya cup, dont be no punk
It don't look right if you really ain't drunk
Come on, repeat after me we go S - T - U - P - I - D

[Hook][Verse 1: Mac Dre]
This bitch is steady jockin’, shes beggin’ me to kick it
She’s all on my dick and I know she want to lick it
She’s Wicked, I stick it. Right between her lips
The ones on her face and the ones between her hips
I dips and slips, she fucks then sucks
She ridin’ on my dick while she’s holdin’ on my nuts
Lovin’ how I treat her. Mad cause I won’t eat her
But when I’m lunch she’s happy, she’s lovin’ how I geeta
That first time was cool, then I had too slow up
First I turned her out because now she tore up, from the floor up
But know what? So What. Girl find another
Think I’ll try this potent maccin’ mouthpiece on your mother
Serve it to a mama, She’s eatin up my drama
She’s smarter than her daughter, Cause she can tell that I am..
Mac about his money, Baby was no dummy
I slipped up, and tripped up and put one in her tummy
Couldn’t take my dick out, This bitch thick portioned
Now she’s in the clinic having an abortion
She says that she too old for kids, and I agree
Quickly took heed on the time she didn’t bleed
Now every time I bash it, I use a prophylactic
Baby got to jockin’ and shake moving drastic
Had to let her catch me with her chink, friend Su-Chang
Ooo she caught us fuckin’ and turned it to a group thing
I do things, new things, That we do throughout the night
Never knew the chink hop, would ever be this tight
Had to do this right, Cause I just owned this mic
Beater started something, to keep my pockets tight
Lace em for a week. Then I play the broke-road
Two-weeks later, they had my pockets so swoll
The whole stroll was oh-so, poppin’ when I hit it
Trips, whos getting’ wit’ it?
Listen While I spit it

[Verse 2: Berner]
Bern break bitches for mucho guapo. (Shhhh.)
Salute El Chapo. I party all night on the beach in Jacó
Lost 20 Grand on the tables in Tahoe
Smooth operator I Don’t rock no gator
J’s on my feet. Hot shell for the hater
Make a bitch choose, Take her out a small town
40 cal, long round make em all fall down
It’s the B-A-Y we don’t aim for the sky
I put a grow room in every crib that I buy
Still get my hands Dirty, the whole thing cost 30
Coke so clean, Look so pearly
Yeah I let it grow out, I never pull early
Young guys die, with my cutthroat furly
Packs in the trunk I got weight for sale
No banks please, no paper trail
I put 8 in the mail, I hope it make it there
AMG, Ima race you there. Don’t hate the player
But my mouthpiece crazy, talk the bitch out of 80, baby girl don’t play me.(Uhh)
Big bag, smoke good, where the lean at?
Pop two Xans take a wing-nap
Still right here where the cream at?
Where the city, where the bitch, and the v at?
Man, this shit got me all lazy, In a new Mercedes, with two fly ladies
Coke plug show a broke bitch no love
Might slide in it with no glove
Hold up, bundle so thick it don’t fold up
Rolled up, smoke on stuff, I’m a stoner
Weed head, from the SF City
Where my buds so good and my chain so pretty
Boy![Verse 1 - Mac Dre]
Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid been on niggas head like toupees
I'm a thug cuz, rob the blood out your gaze
A cutthroat nigga, bitch, scandalous for days
From school days I blew bays got ripped and fucked up
In new jays on two ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, saving private Ryan

[Verse 2 - Andre Nickatina]
I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a Glock, put the cash in my socks
Flip the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is yo freak radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money everytime
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign
[Verse 3 - Mac Dre]
I got split personalities, I'm bi-polar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
Wid two women of each races, boy I control a
A whole ho stable I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough ho dead it, that's right I said it

[Verse 4 - Andre Nickatina]
I grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chil pill freak do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns
Man it's the god of Khan check it baby right or wrong
Can look but don't stare it's the crime rhyme king
Wid braids like a juvenile Khan nahmean?
Wid Bruce Springstein in my Anchor blue jeans
Oh yeh I'm in ya city man what's up with the weed
Man call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' nigga what you need
Hit the corna so narrow in a fly blue Camero
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

[Verse 5 - Mac Dre]
We in a seven series beama it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harrass a bitch like Martin did Gena
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanours
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, pimp done slapped Tina
I mack nina from black to latina
Clean as Noxema quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Willamina, Tina and Trina got dick by the bay on a Berkeley Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake syrup and butter

[Verse 6 - Andre Nickatina]
Man the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear roll up rise like a phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino Felix
Put it in a capsule seal it deal it
How you want it Nicky baby four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot pies
Excuse me if I'm greedy cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiga you can trust
Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white Velour suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
With a back like a cobra cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking real bad freak meet me by the car[Mac Dre Talking]
C'mon
Let's do it
What it is
Thizz is what it is
Another knocker
Kick this game around like soccer

[Verse 1]
Pull up a chair let me make you a plate
Of this game that's seasoned like a tasty steak
Since '88 I've been serving them well
I was serving yayo when L was Rocking Bells
Clocking mail get get getting it
Copping it flip flip flipping it
Now I'm spitting it bar for bar
European whipping it car for car
No dough, ho? You know I say no
I need you like Jaws need a rain coat
I put dangles stay high as the star spangled
Choke the blood out you bitch get strangled
Get mangled fucking with this pimping
Hot as Lipton Dre Jay Trimpson
You better pay attention it's all gamed up
Peep the bio the file see how I came up

[Hook]
Since '84 I been out there gettin my dough
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin hoes
Rolling on vogues and 2-4s
Dre trippa got to stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas boy I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say thar she blows!

[Verse 2]
When I sweat her I say read my lips
Bring me cheddar bitch bring me chips
Fingertips ass hips and lips
Folow my lead dont ask questions bitch
I want fresh fits from Abercrombe & Fitch
When it's going down the Mac comes and shits
The Mac comes to spit
Let me do it to your ear baby
I'm trying to flip see I do it every year baby
Real off the laddish
Getting my cottage
Cheese geez please beez freeze
Stop it you're heading down the wrong path
Fuck making love, bitch I want a tongue bath
Dumb cash can you do it like me?
Cash a fat check at the bank with no I.D
Can you blow by me when I'm doing 100?
Smacking slapping in my 500

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got cutthroat friends and lots of women
I ride in a Benz but I'll squat a lemon
I want a stuffed turkey with all the trimmings
To pay and play extra innings
I'm winning the fat lady start singing
I'm finna get the Cougnut and start swinging
Skeet dance and eight
And when they run my plates, model and make
I'mma shake like I'm riding with a K
Pedal to the metal rarely hit the brake
I love a high-speed getaway
They wanna get rid of Dre
Put the kid away
But I'm in the day I'm in the 7 series
So quiet you can't even hear the
Engine when I smash the gas
And would you look at all the wood on the dash

[Hook]Hello everybody...(Hi)..
I like to introduce you to the Thizzle Dance...(Thizzle Dance?)
Thizzle Dance I said..
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

[Mac Dre]
First, I do like this
Put a look on my face like I smelled some piss
Bounce to the beat till it start to hurt
Then I dust all the smirk off mi shirt
Dip to the ground as I catch the bass
Then I wipe all the sweat off mi face
Hop back up then I start to slide
Popping my collar as I glide
Then I break the thang down and do the bird
Dust myself off like I just stole third
Come on everybody now's the chance
Fuck the Harlem Shake, this the Thizzle Dance

[Hook 2x]
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

[Chuck Beez]
First of all I hope you got you a juice
A Thizzle because its time to pop you a few
Then you gasp, brake, start the jet
Bounce with the car as it start to shit
Then you open up the car doors
The whole damn car low
Hopped out the Impalo
While you let the car roll
Ghostride the whip while you ride the strip
Here's your chance to do your dance on the side of it
While you at it the passenger and driver switch
Then hurry up and jump back inside your shit
Hanging out the rooftop
Do not get ooh-aahed by them foo's cop that tryna have you got
Other than that you and your boys coon big
You wanna learn the coon stay tuned to thizz
Hoochie-mama freaks, get yo man
And show them nigga's how to do the Thizzle Dance

[Hook 2x]
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?

Ahh, what, Thizz... ahh Thizz what..
Ahh, what, Thizz... ahh Thizz (what)..

[Mac Dre]
When I do it they say I'm killin it
The look on my face mean I'm feelin it
Just like the niggas that I'm chillin wit it
You can't do the thizz unless your pillin it
This is the last verse then I'm sellin it
After this niggas gon be stealin it
This is hip-hop with no Johnny Gill-in-it
No New Edition or Prince when I'm spillin it
I'm 12 years strong and I'm still in it
Now I'm slugged up
And diamond grillin it
I don't care who woman I'm dealin wit
I do the dance with Nancy Limchillinwit

[Hook 2x]
Dance, Thizz Dance
Thizz Dance, Thizz Dance
Can you do the Thizzle Dance?Listen up, I'm about to get dope
It ain't nothin' but some shit I wrote
About a young brotha deep in the game
They call me Mac Dre and I'm keepin the name
I sport Nike shoes, I got a mic to use
To talk bad about suckers, I don't like the fools
Down and dirty bout spittin' my hits
And if not, I'm gettin' my grits
Playin' the game like it's supposed to be played
Makin' much more than the minimum wage
Not a pimp daddy, don't drive a Caddy
I just mack and get all that babby
Dre, you know I never slow down
Smokin cesstee until I'm really towed down
Walk into the party, fully perked
Grab the microphone and let the mouthpiece work
I got hype and the game starts flowin'
The girls get freaky and it starts showin'
And when the party's over at the end of the night
They say: Damn, Mac Dre you ain't nothin' polite
Cuz I'm the numero uno, could never be the dos
A Mack named Dre and I'm poppin the most
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

"Tell me somethin' good"
II'm too hard for the fuckin' radio

My rhymes are dope cuz Mac Dre made 'em
And made you geek every time you play them
On your tape deck, hooked to your ZAPCO
A little hard, but brotha I'm a mack, though
Nothin' nice, makin' raps that you wanna hear
Gettin cessted, put my hands on the beer
I can't help it, that's what I like to do
Sloppy drunk, rappin' on the mic for you
A young brotha, kinda bone-skinny
I take a girl to the Golden Penny
Get romantic, just like I planned it
Then cut turf and leave the girl stranded
Is it hard becuz I just beat it?
Not really, that's what the girl needed
That's game, I thought that you knew this
Mack game, and mine is the smoothest

Like lotion I'm in motion
I'm a mack, I was a big ocean
But no matter what the fuck your name is
Nothin' nice is what my game is
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radio

"Tell me somethin' new"
I'm too hard for the fuckin' radio

Come to the Northside of the V
The C the r the e the s-t
Hit Leonard, what will be seen?
20 young niggas gettin full of the heem
This is the Romper Room, and you know who I am
The mack named Dre, so get with the program
Nothin' proper, freaks will clock ya
And if there's funk, then punk we'll mop ya
So beware of the four-door Delta
Get your crew if you think they can help ya
And step up but not too close
Cuz the Crestside is poppin the most
And all you girls, don't you feel left out
And to the boys, I've worn that flesh out
And after that we can still be friends though
And if not, we'll be friends with the Indo
Romper Room kickin on Leonard Street
Mac Dre full of the Hennessy
18, makin' raps 'til I'm 80 though
And too hard for the fuckin' radioNiggas get their thoughts together
Hey! Look over here! I'm open!
Pass it!
Right? Yeah
Pass the weed motherfucker!
Hey Mr. babysitter would you look at all them ashes?
The blunt's going out, is you ever gonna pass it?
Rat bastard it's always you
Sneaking extra hits--I wanna get high too!
Don't lie fool, I see it in your eye
Aight--how come I don't look that high?
Cause you've been smoking more than I
(Hey man we need some more weed!)
Hmm I wonder why?
Hey man what's this all on it? Slob?
Nigga, quit giving the blunt a blowjob
Always cutting, trying to show stop
Oh you get an extra hit just because we at your spot?
I need some more pot cause this ain't kosher
Call Rich the Factor cause I need dozier
Man you know what? You can take your Swisher Sweet to the face
I'mma go get me a Backwood and roll me an eighth

[Hook (x2):]
Hit it two times and pass
(Can I smoke with you?)
Hit it two times and pass
(That's what you're supposed to do)[Verse 1]
Microphone check let me get to the beat
Dedicated to you bitches, let me spit to you freaks
I'm gonna serve it to you straight a little something like this
Not one of those niggas that be liking to kiss
Theres no telling what your tongue licks, it might be big dicks
So you better try kissing on them other tricks
Cause ???? I like to ball hog
I know you love what I shove and thrust up in your cock...
All damn day

[Hook]
All damn day ho
All damn day ho (I'm gonna rock this motherfucka all night yall)
All damn day ho
All damn day ho (I'm gonna rock this motherfucka all night yall)

[Verse 2]
I'm MD and mackin' is my duty
So when I step to you girl and tap you on your big booty
And start spittin' some pimpin' ass serious shit
Don't even start trippin' on how freaky you get
Its just a gift to G-A-B, to get to your P-A-D
Bash in your ass, inside of the B-E-D
Bust a 415 and not the 012
Now you fiending for more, but you wait 'til I call you
See some of these niggas cold want you to jock 'em
Stupid motherfuckas, but I can't knock 'em
I just wanna bash ho, and only get cash ho
You want Dre to stay and lay, but I have to pass ho

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Cause that lovey dovey shit just ain't gon' get it
When I pick you up to fuck, I straight hit it and quit it
And you dont trip because the sexin' is good, I be wreckin' 'em good
And they be back in the hood
Tellin' my cuddies how cool it was
Now another romp player might give you a buzz
Young C-U-R-T, or maybe young Marty
Or my homeboy J might be your type of party
Who ever it is, they gon' get with you bitch
And dont even think they gon' sit with you bitch
No talkin' and walkin' cause that shit is funny style
You pay me and lay me and when I take your money I'll...
Spend that shit all damn day

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I'm hard but saucy bitch back on off me
Steady tryin' to toss me, ho smell the coffee
I gave you some ho, did not cum though
Your too damn dumb ho, what you actin' sprung fo'?
I'm hard to get with, pimperistic
I want your lipstick on top of my dick tip
I'm from the V-A double L E-J
O and you know ho, the things that we say
Are simple and plain, nothing but game
And if you ain't up on it Mac Dre is the name
I want a fat ass joint of that potent zesty
And a thick chocolate bitch whose name is Nestle
From the C-R-E-S-T, cause thats where the best be
Suckas get jealous and they try to test me
So I carry a nine all the time
Dope raps I rhyme, this is how I grind
Making stacks of cash, down to wax that ass
A nigga ready to blast a muthafucka real fast
Dickin' the ho's, never lickin' the ho's
Big black dick is what I stick in the ho's
I shake 'em, I break 'em, but never will I take 'em
To eat hamburgers let alone some steak and
Lobster, cause baby I'm a mobster
You tell your friends how I robbed ya

[Hook][Hook 2x]
A little bit of game is all it takes
A little bit of game goes a long, long way

[Verse 1]
Cuddie I don’t sleep much, cause when I close my eyes
I hear cries from my partners who lost they lives
Visions of bloody brutality's reality
Got to stay focused and hope it don’t affect my salary
Them calories, they keep my pockets fat, I got to stack a grip
Try not to trip, and keep them gold diggers off my dick
I'm getting' sick cause I drink 24-7
The way I’m living' now, if I die, there’s no heaven
Got to help my partner’s in the pen cause they living broke
This ain’t no joke, on parole and I can’t smoke
No sticky indo, roll down the window
Cause if I breathe the tac is back light like Nintendo
Got to play the game like a professional
If you ain’t having money I got to let you go
I need to let you know the rules before you infiltrate
Rule number one partner, never should you pimpatrate
I spit this pimping straight - uncut, no additives
Just nouns and adjectives, how mad you get don’t matter bitch
I'm a player, so I serve the game
Maintain, campaign, and have thangs

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Back in '92 I was drowned in them big cases
But now it’s '97 and I’m counting them big faces
I switched places with them sardines and squares
The tiger prawns, fillet mignon, and garlic bread
A hard head, big heart, and gorilla nuts
Got me mobbing' thru the bay like I don’t give a fuck
I'm whipped, equipped, and stay dipped in butter sauce
Peel if she’s real, no skrill, I cut her off
Cause fine ass bitches with the empty bank books
Is worse than them ugly muthafuckas who can’t cook
My game cooked for five years in the feds
Now it’s time for these game hungry niggas to get fed
I get bread, so them suckers down me
Smile in my face but clown me when they not around me
Talk down on my every move, but I couldn’t give a damn
Playas do what they want, and suckers do what they can

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
7-5-70, my D-O-B
And I’ve been breaking' hoes since '83
Money makers manual, handle my business discreetly
Don’t give my home phone number out, beep me
Cause ain't no telling' who be telling', or who they tell
And plus I heard that they be selling' kinfolk the yayo
Boy get your mail, don’t act like your little sister
If you lacking' in this macking boy, I bet you fist her
Get some get right as I come tight to this doo doo dumb
Track, that cat k-lou, knew how to come
With mac dre, that 3 c veteran
More game than march madness, and dope as Excedrin
Hit big licks, wouldn’t pull no small capers
I'm a be a dog and stay up like wall paper
Look at these broke bitches like they stank
Collect my bank and stay sharp as a shank

[Hook][VERSE 1: Mac Dre]
Back in December, or was it November?
It's kind of shady, I can vaguely remember
I was at the Peppermill, popping at the bartender
She made me a drink called uh, Bodybender
That's when a smurf pulled on my shirt
Said (Hey, get off my girl, dog, before you get hurt)
I said, "Hold on, I don't know what you think
You better back the fuck up and let me order my drink"
He backed the fuck up and did more than you think
He had a AP, not a nine, but it's sort of the same
So now it's one lonely R-o-m-p
I'm all by myself without nobody
Slightly noided, since death, cannot not be voided?
Somebody slammed the do' on the way comin from the toilet
He looked back, then I pulled out my strap
Slapped him it twice but uh, I should've blapped
Cause this other goon nigga started wildin
I pulled out my faulty phone and started dialin
Told my niggas to come on the double
They finna put a nigga on the goon show, bust his bubble
They said yeah, you know we comin
"But damn my nigga, you always into somethin"

[VERSE 2: J. Diggs]
Recently, June 4th, released from jail
About to hit the streets like a beast from hell
It's that nigga y'all done heard about, young J. Diggs
Love to play the game and I play big
I see suckers havin money and I gots to have some
You in the double R, I gots to have one
I'm all up in his backdo' like knock-knock-knock
The nigga moved too fast, so I pop-pop-popped
Should've stood still, there would be no firing
But it's a little late, all I'm hearin is sirens
So now I'm in the wind like leaves on trees
I'm in the crowd tryin to blend like d's on v's
I'm sweatin bullets, I'm an ex-con out on parole
What the fuck was I thinkin, I'm out of control
I'm at the Romp House and I'm huffin and puffin
My niggas lookin at me crazy cause I'm always into somethin

[VERSE 3: Sleep Dank]
Yo, we fuck with heavy guns, fuck around and pump heavy slugs
We drinkin Rémy doin heavy drugs
Nigga, we stay explosive, it's about a quarter to six
Step out the limousine, my wallet's 'bout a quarter inch thick
Nigga, we shittin on em, I pop the three-piece, savage
So many carats up in my ice I could choke a rabbit
Bitches screamin for me but all it took was one dirty look
We hit that nigga with that murder book
Nigga tried to step fast, hit him in the face with a Moët glass
Spilled drink on his bitch, the whole club hit the do' fast
Trunks is poppin, niggas wingin in the parking lot
We keep it gangsta with them choppers out
S-l double, I smell trouble, boy, it's nothin
Keep your peace, muthafucka, I'm always into somethin

[VERSE 4: Da' Unda' Dogg]
Let me tell you somethin 'bout a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Cause niggas done switched up, I guess they got it mixed up
Now I'm a dust the heater off my shelf and leave em bitched up
Like this one nigga actin like a dumb nigga
S-in on his chest with no vest, yeah, he a dumb nigga
Ain't no love in this thug shit
Now he at the club tryin to hug on my thug bitch
Plus she done gave me the run-down on how this nigga run round
Town speakin on my name, tonight he get gunned down
His bitch about to set him out, open the door and let him out
Caught his ass headed out, Bronc style, dead him out
Never have beef with a nigga who bitch you wanna sleep with
Cowards get devoured on that sweet shit
Hit him with the venom, then bounce with my adrenaline pumpin
Yo nigga always up into somethin[Verse 1 - Mac Dre]
Backwoods got me congested ain't rested in two days
I'm gettin' paid been on niggas head like toupees
I'm a thug cuz, rob the blood out your gaze
A cutthroat nigga, bitch, scandalous for days
From school days I blew bays got ripped and fucked up
In new jays on two ways I scritched and scratched up
I beat that batch up when I found out she lyin'
Who she think I am, saving private Ryan

[Verse 2 - Andre Nickatina]
I make ya town move just by walking on ya block
Take the keys to ya city but I still pick the lock
Buy a car and a Glock, put the cash in my socks
Flip the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock
To hell with the law, the freeway's mines
So is yo freak radios and Alpines
Coke with a little bit of cherry lemon lime
Ya think of me ya think of big money everytime
Candy coat shine like the trigger of a nine
Orca was a whale but Pisces is the sign
[Verse 3 - Mac Dre]
I got split personalities, I'm bi-polar
You might see me with my Italian stallion or my chola
Rap rock and rolla, I'm dope as yola
If you don't pimp her, I might like Dola
I'm riding in a big boat like Noah
Wid two women of each races, boy I control a
A whole ho stable I'm a mack and I'm ready
No dough ho dead it, that's right I said it

[Verse 4 - Andre Nickatina]
I grip my dollar bills like my Caddy steering wheel
I'm not a chil pill freak do what you will
Heart ticking like a time bomb eating spicy prawns
Man it's the god of Khan check it baby right or wrong
Can look but don't stare it's the crime rhyme king
Wid braids like a juvenile Khan nahmean?
Wid Bruce Springstein in my Anchor blue jeans
Oh yeh I'm in ya city man what's up with the weed
Man call all the Gs, and tell 'em all freeze
Andre Nickatina sayin' nigga what you need
Hit the corna so narrow in a fly blue Camero
A sparrow dodge a arrow but not a double barrel

[Verse 5 - Mac Dre]
We in a seven series beama it's me and Nickatina
Ready to sexual harrass a bitch like Martin did Gena
Committin' felonies and hella misdemeanours
A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener
Rap singer, pimp done slapped Tina
I mack nina from black to latina
Clean as Noxema quick to pop the nina
Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her
Willamina, Tina and Trina got dick by the bay on a Berkeley Marina
Don't mean to point the finger but uh
She got pancake syrup and butter

[Verse 6 - Andre Nickatina]
Man the way I smoke weed it's like death of a genius
Reappear roll up rise like a phoenix
This is not a remix, Nino Felix
Put it in a capsule seal it deal it
How you want it Nicky baby four times five
A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot pies
Excuse me if I'm greedy cause I'm caught up in the lust
I'd lie if you want but I'm a tiga you can trust
Cause I'm on Fillmore in a white Velour suit
In a blue Kangol, in my Wu-Tang boots
With a back like a cobra cursed by the mail
My manicured nails touch a triple beam scale
Baby is a athlete, body like a star
Ya talking real bad freak meet me by the carArtist: Mac Dre
Album: Back N Da Hood
Song: Back N Da Hood

Another sleepless night in Fresno Jail
I got a federal hold and I can't even bail
Eyes wide open like a dope fiend geeked
I need some cock hella bad, I need to be free
Steady dreaming about wrecking guts and cock
Laying on my bunk busting nuts in socks
Celly on top bunk knock smooth out
Snoring mothafucka, I should just shout
And wake his ass up cause I can't sleep
If a nigga had a way, a nigga would creep
And make a clean break but that's just a dream fake
This can't be real, man, it all seems fake
3 am and it's time to E-A-T
Cold cream of wheat and a lunch in a B-A-G
This shit is the pits, man, how worse will it get, man
I need to be N Da Hood, straight getting a grit, man...

I'm missing the crew, the dope fiends too
I'm writing this rap, there's nothing else to do
Cause home is a place that it seem I won't go
Sleeping in a cell with some fools I don't know
Dope fiends that just don'y got no...
Sense and fince to get shipped to Wasco
I'm stuck like chuck way down south
When I need to be at home with a joint in my mouth
Smoking and choking on some hurt cha dick weed
I just can't wait to straight perk and get key'd
I need to be N Da Hood straight swinging tight ones
Burning long rubber on the black and white ones...

Back N Da Hood sound so good
They won't set bail but I wish they would
I P-R-A-Y every D-A-Y
Asking to get back to the B-A-Y
But every court date they keep detaining me
On punk ass charges they keep arraining me
At first I thought I'd have to spank you
But Detective Nichleman, I'd like to thank you
You put me on the news and tried to spread that lie
Then record sales jumped to an all time high
Why rob a bank when a nigga can spit?
I need to be N Da Hood cause I ain't did shit
Every damn day my tapes are sold
I make more money than the bank can hold
And though I might can't bail out...
This punk ass jail house
I'll just kick back and watch my mail sprout...

Plenty of time for a nigga to think
But all I can think of is dank and drank
On jail walls my name is carving
Waiting on comissary, man, I'm starving
Ten black brothas and fifty julios
I just can't wait to hit the studios
And let fools know about the set up
These punk police won't let up
They trying to keep me down and keep me in a ditch
But the only thing they doing is making me rich
They painted a picture of a ruthless villain
Told all my fans that I was stealing
Jealous mothafuckas, I never steal
I make more money than you never will
Mac Dre arrested for attempted heist
The mothafucking feds ain't nothing nice
They said I was the one doing all this shit
But banks just keep on getting hit
Feds trying to send a nigga up the creek
But Dre ain't worried cause the case is week
They say I'm the one calling all the shots
But fuck them feds and fuck them cops
And to that punk mothafucka Detective Nic Dic
Hear me loud and clear, fool: suck my big dick![Intro: Mac Dre]
Yeah
I feel ya
I don't know what to say
That's how it's going down?

[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
Woke up one mornin 'bout 6 o'clock
Dick still smellin' like spit n cock
Beeper vibratin' like a nympho sex toy
It's time to collect, them hoes got they checks boy
But on my way out the motel room the bitch said
'Dre, why must you go so soon'?
Thinkin' about the night before and how she licked me
I bounced back in so I could get me a quicky
Dick hard as ten pounds of frozen neckbones
I got my wreck on and got the heck on
Droppin' a ho off, you know I had to show off
I burnt rubber and the bitch tried to go off
But all I did was laugh, like she was a joke
Hit the gas, and left her ass in smoke
Strikin' in my Chevrolet you know I had to smash it
Dippin' and dodgin', makin' my way through traffic
Marily marily, marily marily I go
Looked in the rearview, damn
It's 5-0
Once again pullin' me over for the jack up
In my mirror I can see him callin' back up
But I ain't goin' out like no sucka
Put the pedal to the metal and smoked the mothafucka
Stopped at the store on Sacramento and Tennessee
Got a pack of zig-zags and a fifth of hennessy
Percin' off the dank and the drank connection
It's back to my mission nigga, bank collection

Back to my mission
Back to my mission
Back to my mission

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
Rollin' in my old school Lincoln, drinkin'
Joint between my lips and I'm dankin', sinkin'
Deep in the seat, with the beat on the down-low
But I ain't trippin' on the way it really sound though
I got down ho, ready to hit the track
And bring back fat stack of them greenbacks
Hit the stroll but before I let her go
I let her know, she's nothing but my ho
4 was the time on my wristwatch
Grabbed my phone, turned it on, cause I just got a motherfuckin
Beep from a freak on another strip
Get the hennessy and I take me another sip
Call the bitch back and she's ready, to kick down
What she made, from just gettin' dick down
Bounce to the spot where my ho does work
See her in a skirt and a see-through shirt
Pull her off the track and I don't say shit
Cause all I wanna hear is that purse unzip
Lookin' at the bitch with the pimpish grin
Feelin like the mac as my ho kicks in
Let the bitch out, start unloadin' my cut
Let the 15's slam and I'm fuckin em up
They can't understand how I bounce my head
Smokin' on a joint at a light that's red
Niggas can't be me but they wish they could
The light turned green and I hit the hood
See my homeboy Don in a '74
The rollers got him jacked but they lettin' him go
Catch up with him up at the light
Said 'what's up cuddie, where they at tonight'?
He said 'it's goin on playa at the afterdark
And there's a house party bumpin in college park'
Playa waved to my homie then I split from the scene
It's back to my mission nigga, gettin' the green

Back to my mission
Back to my mission

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
Late one night, I drove my Brome to the burger spot
Stepped in all I saw was a herd of cock
Went in my pocket, came out with the yack bottle
Twist the cap then I took me a fat swallow
All I could smell was cock in the air
And I can tell by they stare they was jockin' the playa
Went to the counter ordered burger and milkshake
The girl standin' behind me was thick with silk fake
Hair that looked the real but she had looks to kill
I Stepped back and gave the broad my spill
Told her my name and she couldn't believe dat
Kept spittin' game til I peelt her weave back
She recognized the playa and she knew I was major
Gave her the number to my Pactel pager
Snatched my grub, then I hopped in my town car
And let them landstars slam, and pound hard
Honked at the hutch when I cut from the scene
Then it's back to my mission nigga
Gettin' the green

Back to my mission
Back to my mission[Mac Dre imitating a Middle Eastern convenience store clerk]
Hello my friend, How you do my friend? What would you like?
Yes, what would you like?
"I want uh... pack of Backwoods...pack of Backwoods
Give me a fifth of that privilege Hennessy and uh... thats it"
Thank you very very much

[Verse 1]
What you know about me? I'm Mac Dreezy
Call Hennessy heem and a blunt a bleezy
I keep a fat sack wrapped in a Backwood leaf
Smoke trees that make me look Japanese
Green seedless, mean when I'm weedless
Never in denial, I'm a fiend and I need this
Any day is a bad day for Mac Dre
When he ain't got it, they ask why he act that way
I smoke champ, kush and Naid
Man whats Naid? - Bomb that's sprayed
I can't fade a beezy who don't keep a bleezy
Rolled for a neezy
I ask her, what the feezy?
I gotta have weed to go get weed
You dont like it? Kiss my ass till your lips bleed
This one's for the club so I'm kinda like keeping it clean
Sing it with me y'all
Bleezies n heem

[Hook (x2):]
I gots to have my dope
Everywhere I go
When they ask me, what's my drink?
I say heem, man, what you think?

[Verse 2]
I L-O-V-E H double-E M
I drink like ten of them things that swim
"He's heeming again" is what they say when I come around
I'll get dumb drunk and fuck up your compound
Your building your establishment
Mobbin', saying "cuddie I'm hella bent"
Oh what a feeling when you're looking at the ceiling
And it's spinning and the earl starts spilling
I drink heem when I perk don't like Erk and Jerk
It don't work, when a nigga chillin'
Might spill it on my Abercrombie Fitch
Know I got the man at the liquor store rich
Well baby would you please run and get
Me another Hennessy fifth?
Bleezies n heem

[Hook x2]

Fire up, lets get drunk
Get your cup, fill it up, don't be no punk
A party ain't a party if every damn body
Ain't lifted and a little bit tipsy
But don't drink and drive, I remember one time
My cuddie Joogy, wrapped his fifty, rap this with me
And if you don't understand
You a inbred, your daddy and your uncle was the same man
I gotta have dope everywhere I go
When they ask me what I drink I say, "heem, what you think?"
I gets heem in me, only substitute's Rémy
In Sac with Jimmy, or in Portland with Kenny
I'm danked out, dranked out, can't talk, can't count
If I want some more I'm making baby pull her bank out
Who on a bomb? Boy, what do you mean?
Sing it to me yall
Bleezies n heem[Verse 1: Mac Dre]
I know, do re mi
But no I'm not a R&B singer
I'm a gangster rapper throwing up the middle finger
To them square Rubik's Cubes, who don't smoke and use
I'm a cutthroat boy and I got a short fuse
I get kind of hyphy when I'm gone off a little gin
You don't like it? Say hello to my little friend
Rat-a-tat-tatta, it really don't matter
I push a hard line cross it, niggas gon' scatter
I'm not the mad rapper, I'm the rapper gone bad
Recording on Pro-Tools at the pad
I get a gang of bab, boy I'm a sav
Come through the Sideshow yokin' the Cad

[Hook (x2):]
Fuck what it cost, I'm a boss tycoon
Dipped in sauce
I floss
I-coon

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
What you know about a 600 V12 CL's
Spinnin' on them Spreewells
Dirty as hell like fuck a detail
Still knock yo female
Mack that bitch til' she break her Lee nails
On the track in the TL, Yukmouth
First week out 80 thousand on the street sales
Now I'm CEO that's seven dollars on the retail, bitch
I got niggas poppin' they collars, poppin' E pills
Poppin' them bottles, to poppin' them cowards with that heatelle
And fuck Spitz, I get my ice from Vionnis
My New York Italianni, he plug me with Spanish mamis
Bitches belly dancin' like a swami, but fuck 'em
I'm too cocky, poppin' that Dom P., smokin' my broccoli
Cause I'm a million dollar man like Ted DiBiase
The Feds see me, watch me, baby Liberace
The wrist stay rocky, the whips stay saucy, rims glossy
With mackin' ass Dre beside me
Call me frosty, Frosty the Snowman, the Oakland dopeman
Sell more kicks than Copeland's, bitch
The Oakland mayor, the Oakland Raider
With the king of Vallejo, bitch, Foldin' paper

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Mac Dre]
I ride around town in my clean ass Benz
Range Rov, Cougnut on some clean ass rims
Hot like Ted Turner, I pack the lead burner
Spit it, to get it, can't quit it I'm a bread earner (ch-ching)
Post up at the 5-star telly, Dre touch mo' bread
Than the motherfucking deli
Young rich nigga, 20 inch nigga
P-I-M-P it's all on a bitch nigga
I've been getting scrill, diamonds in my grill
Rep the pill, and boy do I keep it trill
Showoff, that'll go off on a blade
Kill like Raid and stay gone off naid
Do what the fuck I wanna, got bitches on the corner
Not just a thizz user, I'm a thizz owner
Sometimes I thizz, sometimes I shroom
But whatever I do, I'mma stay a Tycoon

[Hook][Hook: Mac Dre]
Ford, Chev, whatever ya got
Don't mean shit, shit ain't hot
Lincoln, Caddy, whatever ya got
Push it man, don't be scared to squat

[Dre Dog]
Quick fast in a hurry
Squat bounce drop dirty
Cocaine white tiger white walls
HIt the freeway hard at night y'all
With the keys right there I'm ready to drive
Like a eagle at 12 I'm ready to fly
Pager going off, the cell phones ringin'
Al Green's playin' and I keep singin'
Jeans creased up with the beat up
Now I'm about to go pick this little freak up
Blow L's, make mail, ponytails
Had to compliment her on her fresh done nails
Varoom, motherfucker boom boom
A whole block of green lights, freak zoom zoom
Mario Andretti with Blowjob Betty
Pedal to the metal when your ridin' with the devil
Did just that at In-n-Out Burger
No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out no delayin'
Did a donut right is what I'm sayin' SHIT
Police came, I was on the streets
Smokin' more weed, bumpin' more beats
Puttin' more words in the ear of this freak
Cadillac girl, somethin' I'mma keep, Seville?

[Hook]

[Mac Dre]
Cam, lifters, ? shifters
Three fifty one make the old school swifter
Rap in the trunk, slap in the trunk
Fat four-four in my lap for the funk
Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the bump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rear view mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then I shake 'em
A real Cutthoat nigga ain't no fakin'
I shoot, ain't scared to scoot
And shake them one time on a hot pursuit

[Hook]Whaaaa...

Ah yeah, this is Mac Dre back in your face (California)
I got my homeboy Coolie in the place (California)
Kick back, let us tell you about..

[Verse: Mac Dre]
This California lifestyle that I live
Woofers in the truck straight slammin'
Strike it through the neighborhood jammin'
Where you could drop the top, or blow the brains
Hit in the intersection and do some things
Passin' up folks with a gang of yolks
Smooth, thick legs, no pantyhose
Silky perms and dookie braids
Brothers with curls, some with bangs
Have parties rock, way past three
Players straight sip on Hennessey
High street chasers, Chevy racers
Having sex in the strangest places
Nike shoes, Levi's jeans
Triple gold Daytons and muthafuckas
Some on vocals, some on leads
Brothers like me rap to the beat
Dual exhaust, candy paint
Fat bank and gang a dank
Never on time, always late
On the Bay Bridge or the Golden Gate
If you wanna live on the best coast
You better try to move to the west coast
Well, life is too short and the game is thick
Home of the Mac, and group of your chicks
Where brothers stay on the savage grind
Kids with the freak when they find the time
The C-A-L-I-F-O-R ... N-I-A rap superstar
Dose for dose, I love to spit
And for the dank, I love to hit it
Hold me in, so it can choke me
When I get dank, it will provoke me
Just bust a rhyme, do the mike
A west coast rap, the kind you like
From V-A-double L-E-J-O
Well, makin' dope raps is all I know
Wake up in the morning, eat some grits
Hit the studio, make some hits
Now that you've been told about
What you rap fans get sold about
One million copies, or even more
I'm pumpin' dope rhymes to the record store
Yeah fool, you hear me spittin'
Tellin' you about that California livin'

[Hook: Mac Dre & Coolie]
(California livin')
(California livin')
Oh yeah, I got my friend Coolie in the house...
He's gonna bust one
Yeah, what time they allow C-double O-L on this microphone? goes like this...

[Verse: Coolie]
Kickin' it up everyday, tryin' to make it through
Stackin' a bank, pullin' women and I'll take two
You wanna be down with this California lifestyle
Proof is with the child, now livin' wild
In the streets of California you better be packin'
Now watch your back, into the back is jackin'
The wind breeze, blowin' through the trees
And I'm still gettin' attacked at a hundred degrees
Sings so hard on the avenue
From L.A. to the Bay, brothers stay comin' through
And Benzes, Porsches, Fives, and things
Dropped cool shits, whipped up things
Gold chains and bowls, candy paint and the kitty
Bitches, talk about lips
Some of the best females ever seen
Straight California skanks, out for your dreams
In the gold state, livin' way too real, fool
And if you soft, you best be cool
To the double R, all my time is gettin'
Coolie on Mac Dre, California livin'

(California livin')
(California livin')
(California livin')
(California livin')

[Bridge: Coolie]
Ah yeah, Mac Dre, we're smokin' california livin' on 'em (California livin')
What's up my rap gangs? (California livin')
Ah yeah, that's dope
Check it out, let's put a little somethin' like this...
Somethin' like this, check it out...

[Verse: Mac Dre]
1-2-3-(3) California livin' it up
Girls be givin' it up
Kickin' back on the track
With a some Hen. in your cup
It's a twelve month party
So when you see me on stage with Lat and Marty
Get out your seat and feel the beat
Peel the freak and don't stop 'til seas kills the feet
On the California coast we pop the most
And dose for dose let's spit the dough
On the w-e-s-t c-o-a-s-t
It's young Mac Dre from the c-r-e-s-t
Down and dirty, doin' things
Only players can do
Straight California livin' is what I'm sayin' to you
Ridin', sidin', whipin', dippin'
24/7 the brotha ain't trippin'
Mac Dre, the one you like to listen to
Nationwide and now I'm offensive, too
Put a little swing in the rap game
And come up strong for the Mac man[Intro]

That's some bull ass shit, Lookin' in yo hom for yo chips and yo cushion
That's some bull ass shit, And yo hut get whipped
That's some bull ass shit, And yo 30 plus get took
That's some bull ass shit, When you on high risk parole
That's some bull ass shit, You got to do what you told
That's some bull ass shit, Talkin' about some pot in my pee
That's some bull ass shit, Well nigga that shit nadda to me

That's some bull ass shit, If it ain't the Cutthoat Committee
That's some bull ass shit, If you don't tote it with me[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm always late, always on my way
Ain't enough hours in the day to be Dre
Cause in the Bay, things move fast
Stop to catch a breath, you might get passed
And that's yo ass, cause I'mma do it movin'
At 12 o' clock I'm supposed to meet Rubin
But I forgot, Rubin gotta wait
Cause I can't be late for me court date
For goodness sake I'm like "what the fuck?"
I'm noddin' out, I'm sleep standin' up
If I don't go sit my black ass down
I'mma fuck around and, fall down
What the feezy who tryin' to call now?
Oh I forgot, I'm supposed to be at the mall now
I got in-sto', if they knew what they was in fo'
24 hours in a day I need ten mo'

[Interlude]
Had to get clearance
Had to make sure it was cool first baby, the call from up top
??? is we cool?

[Verse 2]
I'm a federal hold nigga do shit that's unbail-able
Do it cutthoatish, unnoticed, untrailable
My bitch gon' make sure the funds are available
I'm a hot commodity, big business, I'm sellable
Infuckincredible, inedible
I'm married to the game so that makes unweddable
No wedding, no romantic setting
I mattress on the floor, no fancy bedding
Get it straight from the gate so you know where this thing is heading
Cold as the snow on the mountains of Redding
Everything she wanna do, I'm not letting
Work a race horse til her hair start shedding
I'm not regretting, the dirt I've done
A nigga wanna wet me I'mma squirt my gun
I need weed that's gon' hurt my lung
And chick with jaw that'll make me squirt my cum

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry to hear your situation has been worsening
Oh I can't complain, me myself personally
Tramp traffic is at all time high
I'm still stuntastic like I've been all my life
And how about wife, she's been hittin' me dog
I think she's considering gettin' me dog
She no longer cherish your marriage cause you financially embarrassed
Man I can take the bitch and go get mo' chips than Harrah's
No day off like Ferris, service is volunteer
By choice not force, it won't be no problems here
Man would guard your chick, she finna do somethin' slick
If she ain't ridin' mine she gon' be ridin' somebody else dick
Cause she tired of ya, done made a lie of ya
Toss her to a pimp, let me show you how I love her
I'mma get it out of her, every penny, every dolla
It's rent money, yanadadaholla

[Verse 4]
You lames missed it, got twisted like a pretzel
I'm a slick nigga cunning, gunning, running from the metro
I get so quick do it movin' bitch I'm federal
Respect it, connected get the stuff from the esé Pedro
I'm a pimp you, but you wouldn't know I dress retro
Breathe life in a ho lung, get her sprung so she can't let go
Shoulda bet mo', scary nigga I'm winner
Eat a nigga for dinner, game strong as paint thinner
If I can't send her, than pimpin', I don't need her
All I need is one mic, my money, and my heater
I steal clientele, short stop like Derek Jeter
I'm ill for my mail will pop out the two-seater
My mouth is too heated, I'm outlawed in a few states
I come through in somethin' ooh, cleaner than you with new plates
Y'all niggas is fruit cakes, same sex marriages
I'mma cutthoat with cutthettes, strapped with derringers

[Verse 5]
Yep, you right, nigga how you know
Man pimpin' had to let that bitch go
She a dime tryin' to steal my shine
Told that bitch take a number, get yo ass back in line
You wastin' my muthafuckin' time
I'm the biggest thang since Sprite put lemon with lime
Have you lost yo muthafuckin' mind
You must don't know, bitch I'm the kind

[Verse 6]
(Man it's cold)
It's cold as the Swiss Alps
The people get on me, than homie I switch routes
Mac Dre stay cussin' a bitch out
Quarterbackin', like Dan Fouts or Tim Crouch
I'm stuntin', watchin' my scritch sprout
Pourin' some Cris out, partna I'm pimped out
Colder than a blizzard in Alaska, or Mount Shasta
In a mask a blast ya, my car fasta, I strike past ya
12 Volt posi, cam and Flowmasters
Keep it to yo'self partna, who asked ya
I teach the game, a preach but no pastor
I'm cold-= Mac Dre talking=
Da U.S. Open [uh, hello, uh]
Let the games begin [hello, uh, hello]

[Mac Dre]
You white around the mouth
Your lips need car-mex
I'm steady jumpin' out more whips than Car Max
I'm rock star stooey wit the Louie guitar strap
Get weeded not conceded
Give a groupie a call back
I'm all that and a bag a chips dude
Got fists dude
Beat downs get issued
I'm rich dude
TV's and errythang
Diamond's shinin', danglin' from my heavy chain
Very plain, and I come dumb wit it
Your soft, hand it off, let a real nigga run wit it
I'm dumb fitted, shitted, P-O-L-O
Your chick's a flirt
She always tell me "hello"
She shake it like jello to see if I'm a look
She off the hook
And potna I'm a crook
I take your bitch if I want her
Cuss up on her
Bust nuts on her

[Hook]: Mac Dre
Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]
If you really love her [if you really love her]
Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]
If you really love her [if you really love her]
Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]
If you really love her [if you really love her]
Handcuff your bitch
Handcuff your bitch
Handcuff your bitch
If you love your bitch

[Mac Mall]
Shackles on the ankle of a fast ho, let her go
Baby boo boo fan of Macenroe at every show
Chasey want an autograph
I gave her dick to the throat
Signed it on her grill
"MAC THE MOST" in capitals
Internationally known
Crestside home grown
Game fed, hard head
Three C's, stoned dome
Let the games begin
Let the mackin' commence
Thizz is in the tilt
And we all ignorant
But later for you hater
Y'all make a good payer
Yo bitch is old news
I get it back when I had the gator
But now it's me and Macassi
Servin' it up savagely
Mac Magician specializin'
Keepin' hoes vanishin' POOF!

[Hook]
