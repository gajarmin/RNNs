[Intro]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks - (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1](x2)
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1]
I've created a monster, cause nobody wants ta
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits; fuck you, Debbie!

[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!!!
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {smak}
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, You sent for me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
(Hey!!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la
Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la
Kids![Hook 1: Eminem]
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I'll shit on you! Girl you know, its true
I'll shit on you! Bitch or man, its true
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I remain fatter than gluttony
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared of huntin' me
I love beef; I got you hoes ducking me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs'll keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nuttin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes ending up in a fucking mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screaming
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll shit on you!)
I'll shit on you!

[Hook 2: Eminem]
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I'm a alcoholic, where's the fucking toilet?
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch, shut your fucking mouth
I'mma keep eating 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fucking with your twelve year old baby sitter (hahaha)
And all women ain't shit - only good for cooking, cleaning
And sucking dick - and that's it! (I said it)
I'm responsible for killing John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up, I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so ANGRY!
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward and I'll-

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles dangling (oww, oww)
My need I stay strangling, I don't need your help
If you don't give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
Yo, it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like Deebo fighting Peabo Bryson (I'll shit on you!)
Fuck what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out!
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; (bling bling)
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

[Hook 2]

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(c'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zany acting maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child (I'll shit on you!)

[Hook 2]

You heard me {*Eminem laughs*}
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you

Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid coming at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (what)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes licking they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doing subpoenas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rapping rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in trying to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, something farther from getting bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on fronting, repenting and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady falling in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike
Driving down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for strangling my boy Jason
Should be taking my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facing
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eating like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure looking good
Rob this little boy in his fucking paper route
Throwing bombs at day care centers and yell "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cause she found out I was having an affair with her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whipping 40-bottles like the fucking Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth; crack open a six;
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollering at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always taking someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packing anyways, do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfucking crib up when I ran past it
Fucking felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talking shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashing in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standing on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rocking the most classic threads
Flashing bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumping the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screaming, "GET THE COPS, QUICK"
And got drop kicked, now she screaming "stop it"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick-a y'all niggas looking at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shitting socks bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fucking knot split
Grab the green from Al by showing him hot grits (no one)
Ain't nobody iller than me

[Outro: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast[Hook 1]
It's (it's) be (be) cause (cause) of (of)
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
Be.. cause.. of..
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do

[Eminem - speaking over Hook 1]
It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit
And my friend came in he was like, "Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You puttin that shit up your nose again?"
And I was like, "Naw" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster and shit
Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor
It's crazy

[Hook 2 - over last two lines of Hook 1]
It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
Do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

[Eminem]
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon)
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
And is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

[Bizarre]
Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
(huh?) 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
That I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!)
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin a half a pound
Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

[Hook 1]

[Eminem - speaking over Hook 1]
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like
Wakin up the next morning like - where the..
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on
You see what I'm sayin? I was just like, out of control

[Hook 2 - over last two lines of Hook 1]

[Swifty McVay]
These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister
Laughin with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha)
The weed that I'm sellin is black look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin' it, after framin' a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Crackin' capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin' like a extra on "Night of the Living Dead"
Until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin' up banks like Uncle Fester

[Proof]
Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ohhhhhh)
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
(Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit

[Hook 1] - 2.5X

[Eminem - speaking over Hook 1]
Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?
Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin
When you're out in the public eye and shit
They're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
"Eminem dies from, drug overdose" - youknowhatI'msayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?
They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they..

[Hook 2 - over last two lines of Hook 1] - 2x[Intro: Proof]
Yeah Soul Intent, checking in
#1 baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is M.C. Proof

[DJ Head]
And DJ Head!

[Proof]
Checkin' in on W.E.G.O
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay yo we got the #1
Requested song, of the day
Coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called "It's OK"[Hook x2: Fuzz Scoota]
Trife thieves we can't be trusted
Step into my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we buckin' bitches

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (AHHHH!)
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldn't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin' dough
Y'all gonna see more fights and spits than the Jerry Springer show
Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggas come ten deep and end up leavin solo
(I'm by myself!) Meet losing ya'll niggas must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard
So when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated while you breathin'
Or you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned face down in a boat (damn)
I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up
To the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes
Telepathically harrasing foes
I know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titanic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show
You passing one blunt bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to "Keep His Head Up"
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like, "Bitch, come and pick this bitch up"
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

[Hook][Young Zee]

And start to spray, gotta pay massive dues
So I take Emcee's that pass the rules
And fly them into space like NASA do

More wine than cherry, raspberry, apple-cranberry, strawberry
Muthafuckin flows extraordinary
Your bitch ass will get bodied and buried
By this slick walking, talking, rhyming dictionary
Gimme your mind, let me ? one
Fairly handsome, blackened like temper tantrums
Spittin like automatic handguns
You can't run
Your style is more garbage than Shirley Manson
You got a platinum single, roll me your money
I'm bummy but I bet I can get your bitch to beat my dick for me

[Bizarre]
Doin drive-bys in less than 2 minutes
And I know one of these houses on the block
Got your fuckin family in it
And what's the worstist, is y'all niggas gon' need nurses
I collect money on your block, like ushers at churches
No matter where your boys go, nigga I'mma get 'em
You can ask Swanson Funeral Home, how much business I be sendin 'em
You forgot bitch nigga, I know where you stay
Loaded AK, get little Johnny out the way
Bet you these bats gauruntee your ass won't be walking
I rock '98 Suburbans while you push cars from the auction
You don't wanna see Bizarre Kid get dumb
I beat a bitches ass when I'm in a good mood
So imagine if I'm in a bad one
You better duck when I pull this nine
I done shut up your block so many times
All I see is For Sale signs
They say these cats only got 9 lives
Bizarre done took 8, so tonight you diiiiiie

[Young Zee]

The reason bitches want me to spend money
Just to spread 'em like Gin Rummy

Holier than Roshashana
With baby mama's that's pro black like the Sada
The lover large and at peace with his god
Behind bars, yall nigga's sittin close with the gaurds

Fag, it's a never ending cycle
Can't nobody come and save you when I start shit
My lead is like Kryptonite to them Clark Kent's
I rip a crew with dust and liquor too
Too despicable
Toss you off the terace on ritaloo(ritual)
I rise like Christ
The third knight on mics
But it ain't Easter
It's only death when I meet you
So GET THE DICK[Young Zee]
Them niggas try to rob me could GET THE DICK
All them bitches try to play me they GET THE DICK
Niggas try to jump B.U. can GET THE DICK
We gon' bang when I see you so GET THE DICK
Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite

I got great skills
And if my record sells 8 mil
I'mma still smoke weed, get dusted, get drunk and take pills
Fast gun play gon' get you blast one day
Fucking with Zee, it be today mothafucka
Newark like a sitcom for no brains
???, Jettin from ? trains
Slip a tab and mushrooms in my coffee
With half a forty, feel like the walls is moving towards me
Till I die from old age
I'll be pullin girls up to suck my dick right on the stage
So stop talking, get them old jelli's walking
'Fore I call Pace celly walkman, and tell him yall been
Acting iffy, and its really starting to piss me
And like popcorn, my nigga's be here in a jiffy
Will all the Mack 10's step beside me
We gon' start wylin and kill everybody

[Pace Won]
To you fronting ass bitches GET THE DICK

To all you mothafucka's GET THE DICK

[Young Zee]
Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite

[Pace Won]
Pace Won, Mr. Perfect, I take a warm shower
Make a condo, out of saw powder
Make the sun eclipse at the born hour
I'm a wizard at this shit like Juwon Howard
Put my gun up in the ass of crews
And start to spray, gotta pay massive dues
So I take Emcee's that pass the rules
And fly them into space like NASA do
I'm a, weed lover, going deep cover
Tricking these goofy ass ho's I need rubbers
Your favorite nucker, flow butter
Niggas get mobbed, leave with they clothes cut up
'When you comin' what they askin me
'You fresh to no limit like Master P'
I be keepin shit milky like ? cream
Pace Won, blaze one, and I'm ? fiends mothafucka

[Young Zee]
Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite

[Azz-Iz]
If your flow is kinda doo-doo
I more filthier than white bums from Newark (brick city!) to Honolulu
More wine than cherry, raspberry, apple-cranberry, strawberry
Muthafuckin flows extraordinary
Your bitch ass will get bodied and buried
By this slick walking, talking, rhyming dictionary
Gimme your mind, let me ? one
Fairly handsome, blackened like temper tantrums
Spittin like automatic handguns
You can't run
Your style is more garbage than Shirley Manson
You got a platinum single, roll me your money
I'm bummy but I bet I can get your bitch to beat my dick for me

[Bizarre]
Doin drive-bys in less than 2 minutes
And I know one of these houses on the block
Got your fuckin family in it
And what's the worstist, is y'all niggas gon' need nurses
I collect money on your block, like ushers at churches
No matter where your boys go, nigga I'mma get 'em
You can ask Swanson Funeral Home, how much business I be sendin 'em
You forgot bitch nigga, I know where you stay
Loaded AK, get little Johnny out the way
Bet you these bats gauruntee your ass won't be walking
I rock '98 Suburbans while you push cars from the auction
You don't wanna see Bizarre Kid get dumb
I beat a bitches ass when I'm in a good mood
So imagine if I'm in a bad one
You better duck when I pull this nine
I done shut up your block so many times
All I see is For Sale signs
They say these cats only got 9 lives
Bizarre done took 8, so tonight you diiiiiie

[Young Zee]
GET THE DICK
Yeah yeah yeah GET THE DICK
Yeah Bizarre yeah GET THE DICK
All you fuckers in Detroit GET THE DICK
Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite

You dummies
The reason bitches want me to spend money
Just to spread 'em like Gin Rummy
I'm Ya Ya
Holier than Roshashana
With baby mama's that's pro black like the Sada
The lover large and at peace with his god
Behind bars, yall nigga's sittin close with the gaurds
Fucking with yall, I'm always catchin charts
Yall won't let us box, yall wanna run and tell the Sarge
Life's short, I play hard
See your crew on the streets
Better know I won't hesitate to spray yall
I keep a rifle killing you and everybody looking like you
Fag, it's a never ending cycle
Can't nobody come and save you when I start shit
My lead is like Kryptonite to them Clark Kent's
I rip a crew with dust and liquor too
Too despicable
Toss you off the terace on ritaloo(ritual)
I rise like Christ
The third knight on mics
But it ain't Easter
It's only death when I meet you
So GET THE DICK[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, Bizarre Kid coming at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (what)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes licking they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doing subpoenas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rapping rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in trying to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, something farther from getting bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on fronting, repenting and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady falling in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike
Driving down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for strangling my boy Jason
Should be taking my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facing
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eating like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure looking good
Rob this little boy in his fucking paper route
Throwing bombs at day care centers and yell "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cause she found out I was having an affair with her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whipping 40-bottles like the fucking Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth; crack open a six;
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollering at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always taking someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packing anyways, do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfucking crib up when I ran past it
Fucking felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talking shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashing in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standing on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rocking the most classic threads
Flashing bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumping the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screaming, "GET THE COPS, QUICK"
And got drop kicked, now she screaming "stop it"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick-a y'all niggas looking at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shitting socks bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fucking knot split
Grab the green from Al by showing him hot grits (no one)
Ain't nobody iller than me

[Outro: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast[Bizarre]
Put y'all guns down, y'all niggas is under arrest
Roll with a nigga named Les that's a child molest
Who wanna confess about the black Smith and Wess
Pull your girl up out her dress, snatch the baby out the nest
Represent the Mid-west, after we drug test
Look like federal express, leavin a whole lot of mess
Carry a fat knot, my crew's always looted
In this corner we have the undisputed
Champ, doin thugs with craps
Rob em blindfolded and take they foodstamps
My team will get your team, we'll see who shook
Once I pull this nine out you gonna need more shield then Brook
Peace to my nigga Dice One and Illin Delph
Your crew took one look at me and pee on themselves
I start beef with Iran and Japan
Then play Roxane behind my live van

Chorus: repeat 4x
As soon as one of you niggas try to over react
BLOAW BLOAW, blown to death

[Bizarre]
I want foodstamps passes and weed to get high
Y'all can kiss this seventy year old handicap girl goodbye (she's dead)
My name ain't Sean cause I ????
Down to kill seventy-six niggas, winnin for the Philadelphia
Your crew's through cause y'all niggas is bad news
Put niggas to work without the W crews
The Outsidaz be catching mad misdemeanor
We be settin shit off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah
Pull my automatic
Kill this stinkin faggot
Only hang around unibombers, peeping Toms and drug addicts
Close your eyes and make a wish
I got ten hoes named Hootie that wanna blow my big fish
With this team I got, nigga who can stop me
Throw a sugar rock out even Ray can out box me
I want to drink till my breath smells
Bringin Motown back without Andre Harell

Chorus: repeat 4x

[Bizarre]
Now who can fuck with me, Eminem, Bizarre and Fuzz
The illest niggas to ever come out the Dirty Doz
Strip your team buttnaked and fill em with hot slugs
My drunken thugs be start fight in clubs
God forbid if I get a little buzz
Cheating on my bitch cause I'm buttfuckin her cuz
You still ain't found out where the hell your daughter was
Got me pissed off, went out and sold her for some drugs
Throwin mad kicks like Bruce Lee boy
Can't you see that I'm a total bad boy
Who wanna get they ass kicked in this verbal fight
Y'all niggas is gettin raped like my dick last night
Sellin mad weed cause I'm a customer
They got more drive-bys than in any Blockbusta
Even Mary thought my style was scary
Smokin blunts in Frisco and ate rice with Jerry

Chorus: repeat 4x[Hook 1: Eminem]
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you -- da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I'll shit on you! Girl you know, its true
I'll shit on you! Bitch or man, its true
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I remain fatter than gluttony
Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared of huntin' me
I love beef; I got you hoes ducking me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs'll keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nuttin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes ending up in a fucking mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screaming
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving (I'll shit on you!)
I'll shit on you!

[Hook 2: Eminem]
I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I'm a alcoholic, where's the fucking toilet?
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch, shut your fucking mouth
I'mma keep eating 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fucking with your twelve year old baby sitter (hahaha)
And all women ain't shit - only good for cooking, cleaning
And sucking dick - and that's it! (I said it)
I'm responsible for killing John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up, I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so ANGRY!
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward and I'll-

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles dangling (oww, oww)
My need I stay strangling, I don't need your help
If you don't give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
Yo, it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like Deebo fighting Peabo Bryson (I'll shit on you!)
Fuck what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out!
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; (bling bling)
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

[Hook 2]

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(c'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zany acting maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child (I'll shit on you!)

[Hook 2]

You heard me {*Eminem laughs*}
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you

Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you[Hook 1]
It's (it's) be (be) cause (cause) of (of)
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
Be.. cause.. of..
These drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do

[Eminem - speaking over Hook 1]
It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit
And my friend came in he was like, "Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You puttin that shit up your nose again?"
And I was like, "Naw" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster and shit
Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor
It's crazy

[Hook 2 - over last two lines of Hook 1]
It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
Do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

[Eminem]
My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon)
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
And is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

[Bizarre]
Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!)
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
(huh?) 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
That I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!)
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
Cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!)
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin a half a pound
Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

[Hook 1]

[Eminem - speaking over Hook 1]
It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like
Wakin up the next morning like - where the..
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on
You see what I'm sayin? I was just like, out of control

[Hook 2 - over last two lines of Hook 1]

[Swifty McVay]
These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister
Laughin with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha)
The weed that I'm sellin is black look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin' it, after framin' a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Crackin' capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin' like a extra on "Night of the Living Dead"
Until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin' up banks like Uncle Fester

[Proof]
Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ohhhhhh)
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms
(Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?)
Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
While D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit

[Hook 1] - 2.5X

[Eminem - speaking over Hook 1]
Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?
Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin
When you're out in the public eye and shit
They're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
"Eminem dies from, drug overdose" - youknowhatI'msayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?
They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they..

Trife thieves we can't be trusted
Step into my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we buckin' bitches

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (AHHHH!)
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldn't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin' dough
Y'all gonna see more fights and spits than the Jerry Springer show
Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggas come ten deep and end up leavin solo
(I'm by myself!) Meet losing ya'll niggas must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard
So when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated while you breathin'
Or you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Floatin' around drowned face down in a boat (damn)
I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up
To the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows

[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes
Telepathically harrasing foes
I know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titanic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show
You passing one blunt bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to "Keep His Head Up"
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like, "Bitch, come and pick this bitch up"
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

[Hook][Verse 1: Dandyguel]

[Verse 2: Tuan X]
I said, put me on a track wit' Nas & them, fuck it
Put me on a track wit' Jay & Em. My name is Tuan
Say it like the numbers bitches 2-1
Bred in The Stuy, Brooklyn 'til I dizzie
Ain't for the punch-line rhymes, I ain't got the tizzime
I hit you wit' that real shit, kop it for a dizzime
I hit you wit' that hood shit, umbrella in the rain flow
Where if you go to prison pretty, come out wearin' a rainbow
Now how that saying go? "Ain't No Love"
We in the heart of the matter lookin' for gram green
Searching for God in a blunt, diggin' for love in a cunt
And all we get is this ditch & a triflin' bitch
My 1st love was a whore, knew I was God when I saw
My boy die, my mom cry, failing to die 3 times
Three lives, now I'm livin' on my last
My future's goin' right & what's left is in the past
See, I told my grandma I'm stayin' off that crime shit
I told my cousin, "When you write make sure it's life shit."
My life's a feature film, music's my cinema,
You are the audience, now here's a preview
There will be no sequel no prequel
It's a one time affair, weave in ya best hair
Put on ya best Airs and wear ya best ears
Now listen, listen here. Mr. X shall be here
Forever long, however long forever long can be
Spit heaven on and hell upon these heroinic beats
Now get up on him, feel up on her, feel a boner.. beat
Now marijuana, legalize it, I don't smoke, I preach
Life's a beach & I'm the best swimmer
And talking to my women, you are the best dinner
And I am so sinner, but I don't believe in hell
If life is fresh water, my mind is the well[Intro: Proof]
Yeah Soul Intent, checking in
#1 baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is M.C. Proof

[DJ Head]
And DJ Head!

[Proof]
Checkin' in on W.E.G.O
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ay yo we got the #1
Requested song, of the day
Coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called "It's OK"[Intro]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks - (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1](x2)
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1]
I've created a monster, cause nobody wants ta
See Marshall no more they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits; fuck you, Debbie!

[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!!!
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {smak}
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, You sent for me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
(Hey!!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

[Hook]

[Outro]

Kids![Intro]
Two ratchet little girls go round the outside
Two ratchet little girls go round the outside
Guess who's back... Back again... Rion's back... Tell a friend
Guess who's back... Guess who's back...

[Verse 1]
I've created a monster, but I disposed of the brain in trashcan, so, my man, what an odd stir
Of events in the last December, dated a cute girl, but I said, screw gifts, and didn't have any to send her
What a d-bag I am, so please remember who you're messin' with or talkin' to, mi amigo, comprender?
My life has enough footage to render forever, but frankly, my life is too darn good to even end here
And I... Got enough hops to offend beer, so all the courts will be so empty without me near!
Just listen to all screamin' without me here... Hear the silence? Without me, there is no fear!
If I scare ya'll on a daily basis, imagine how I am with Halloween faces, gettin' sprayed by ladies in Macy's
With large cans of maces, call security, now looky here, there are no traces
Of a trash talking, flash walkin', Kate and Ash stalkin' weird occurrence of unnecessary
Without me, the world feels so empty, so why don't I fill it up usin' a bag of Hefty
Now get up, and dance to this beat, but only try and use your left feet

[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2]
Reincarnation of the batman, but I like kitties, so call me catman, either way, I'm black with cats, so you can call me that man, anything but fat man fits, and if that hand fits in the mitts, matter fact my mitts, don't wear it
Only I can rock it like I do, cause I blast off, you bunch of dry fruits, never got along with y'all dudes
Never ballin' on the court, yanno, uh, kinda like mall foods
Lemme... sit back and spit stupid similes in my Black Cap, you Chickadees, my songs are remedies
Chillin' in the back over the rim of these-
*Gasp* Stop! It ain't hammer time, but ya'll know the drill, non-killin' villain
But I'm chillin' in the back like a pill and, never used the word "trillen" cause I'm crackin' uncrackable unsellable syllables
Then again sellin'em silly unwitting fitting things... If that makes sense, I jotted'em down without thinkin' anything
Because for me, thinking is messy, I act before thinkin', I pass before testing, I'm "enter resting", I nap before attending, I'm not saving you, I'm just infesting, yeah

[ZombieBoy] Brains brains brains!
[Announcer Guy] Guess who's back!
[Bandit Keith] Guess who's back!
In America!

[VERSE 1: YUGI]
I've summoned a monster!
Cuz nobody wants to see Yugi no more
They want Yami, I'm chopped liver!
Well if you want Yami this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of yaoi fanart of Yami Bakura
Some card games that drag on and on duller
Than the crap on those poor saps' TeamFourStar's channel
Or the gasps in their fanbase when they lose a rating
Or the gaps in their schedule when they're not updating! (HEY!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, it's time to duel, and cards need trading
You may think the dubs are mistranslating
But the guys who fansub are masturbating
So 4KidsTV won't let me be
Or let me be me
So let me see
They tried to switch me out with Dragonball Z
But it feels so empty without me so
Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged burned like a bridge
Got banned, you worried a smidge and raided the fridge
But don't panic, cause this s**t's about to get manic
I just shuffled all my trading cards, F*** YOU MARIK!

[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

[VERSE 2: YUGI]
LittleKuriboh; the guy who watches Yu-Gi-Oh
Embarrassed his parents don't listen to Devo
He starts crying at Finding Nemo
Then he makes a lameo video and everyone yells WHOA!
A visionary, his fangirls are scary
A YouTube revolution, otakus are wary
A rebel, so lemme just revel and boast
In the fact that I got everyone stealing my jokes
And it's a low-blow, such a cacophony
For you to steal so damn much from my show, don't copy me!
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We got screwed by Revver, blew the budget now we're gonna
Begin again, start from scratch and completely
Regain all our subscribers, update the show weekly
No protesting, just like you're all requesting
With all the quotes HeavyDDR's detesting
(Testing! Attention Duelists!)
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Lanipator claims I have animosity
You know what I think? "Who the hell is he?!"

[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me


[VERSE 3:]
Abridge this Abridge that, it's become the new fad
It's a shame that most of the results turn out so bad
Yo Sephirex, quit makin' fun of GX
It's better than most of your video train wrecks
And Kaiser, man, you're none the wiser
Your series is about as funny as Rob schneider
Vegeta and Masako, you guys should just let go, it's over
Nobody watches Naruto
Now farewell
Go abridge some Zatch Bell!
Or post on your blog while listening to Soft Cell
This show's been greater than Ghost In The Shell
Ever since CurtDogg turned it into a nutshell
But sometimes it's all the same
Everybody only wants to call us lame
So this must mean LK's to blame
Cause it's not me, I'm king of games
And while he's not the first one to fandub Yugi
He is the first one that's not a newbie
To make the show seem kinda funny
Though it doesn't make him any money
(HEY!)
There's a concept that's broke!
Twenty million other users steal his jokes
But no matter how many imitate LK
It won't change the fact that he's here to stay


[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me

Cards![Intro]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the fuck outta here

[Hook]
You see I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me

[Verse 1]
You might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Or leaning out a window with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers, dressing ridiculous
Blue-and-red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should've been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fucking brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What is this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to wiling out and being violent?
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken

[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick, boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public, I'mma love it

[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just...
