Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama's water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse, that I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wraped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?

[Verse Three - Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck the football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream, made my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Ma' said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
Seat 74, Mart 8 set me straight
Not able to move, behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

Like the homeless in the road
I'm starving in my soul
They can't get me to go
If there is no you

Just like a rose
I sat and watched us grow
And you never hear me low
I know this love is true
We've seen it through
It's crazy like the blues
And I've always stuck with you
I want to help share your love
It can't be sold
It can't be priced with gold
And you've always took control
Right now I know...

[Hook:]

I'm on steady ground when you're around
(See you always bring comfort to me)
I'm on precious ground when you're around
(And you've always been so precious to me)
I'm on protected ground when you're around
(Because I always feel so safe around you)
I'm on steady ground when you're around
(And I always feel this way when you're around)

[Verse 2:]

When you're around
You hold it down
You put it down
Piece of the ground
You changed my frown give yourself a pound
When love's tuned loud
The sweetest sound
Always there when I...

[Hook x2]

Ain't no doubt in my mind
Guess I can't stop destiny
Got to be the best for me
From love you cannot run
Even under the gun
At the end of the day
No use looking around
Right now I'm on steady ground
Ain't no doubt in my mind
Guess I can't stop destiny
Got to be the best for me
From love you cannot run
Even under the gun
At the end of the day
No use looking around
Right now I'm on steady ground[Hook: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Shawty, she ain't never meet a nigga like Ace
The way she give me face is amazing grace
They say they love my swag when I drag in the place
And I'm waving at them haters cause I'm highin' out of space
And them bitches know the business poppin' Rosa by the case
The women try to get, get, get me before I get away
They pullin' on my dreads they rubbin' on my chest
The whisper in my ear like they wanna have sex
I'm like shawty wait in line, she like baby I'm next
See mama wanna fuck now she drunk off in the club
Come kick it like it's soccer baby fucking with a thug
I'm feelin' like Usher making love up in this club

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And shawty wanna lick, lick, lick, lick me like a lollipop
I can make her body rock, she want my ass like candy drop
Favourite colour chocolate I'm melting like an ice pop
Pull up in that white drop all them bitches mouth drop
Now they wanna lick me 'till they get me to that centre spot
Let me see you drop it like you muthafucking panties hot
Groupie sex is so delicious now I got to dose it
Li-li-li-li-lick me 'till your tongue reach numbness
And let that tongue ring be really worth something
Say she want to fuck with her hand on her pumpkin
Well trick or treat I give 'em lollipops for coming
Lick, lick, lick, lick lick me shawty whisper what you want

[Hook]Intro:
Yeah, we gonna bust it a little something like this. Me and my nigga Mr
Dalvin. First let me get some weed before I wreck it. Just lay back

Static:
Where the reefer at, where the reefer at?
Run me in the dime, not trying to bust my head
Cause I stays on top of mine (top on mine)
Cause I been ballin' since the days of back when
Niggas wasn't be thinkin' about drink no juice and gin (alright brother)
Niggas be drinkin' the Thunderbird or Nighttrain
Lookin' for the right frame, breakin' like a dice game
Stackin' skrilla so I'm sippin' Hennessy
Lickin' shot after shot at my enemies
Boom boom recognize all persuers been in the game for years
Cause I'm a sho connoisseur
Consume the blocks, drop off my rocks, the quicker a nigga play me
The quicker a nigga who drops, pops of the Glocks
Not trippin' facial experessions, be shittin'
Niggas don't be hearin' all that in every city
Take a nigga out if you gotta on the day to day
Then parlay, ate a gator, parlay, to God nigga

Hook:
It ain't hare to see, when niggas try to be like me
A true O.G., y'all y'all, gotta take you underground
Parlay all day with the niggas from the Bassment sound  (X2)

Mr. Dalvin:
Watch out for I blow, swing low
Forget it, y'all don't hear me though, I'm hittin' switches
Hoppin' like a 64, and I, thought you knew, what I can do
Able to leap tall buildind and run up to your crew (oooooh)
The underground stylistical, got more flavors than mystics
So lay back and watch this nigga kick it
Wicked without thinkin' of funky
But I ain't stinkin', I know I got you open cause I got y'all niggas
Blinkin'
Check it out, you watch me devastate this track
I make stacks and stacks and leave niggas on they backs
Cause I...be a sharp shooter, intruder
Rugged and rough, poppin' off just like a lueger
Now how many niggas, wanna get down, while I say
With Jodeci or the Bassment sound, around
I don't wanna see, handin', my crew is deep and you know that we be bangin'
So give me a bottle of Boons so watch me load my gat
Start a war like Tom Barringer in Platoon
So, don't mess with this flow, Mr. Dalvin is gone like 19 nigga fiz-o, oh

Hook

Come on get down (repeated after every line)
This goin' out to all the players
Shoot outs to the ballers
Much love to the hustlers (all around the world)
Mo power to the pimps
Watch the Bassment make it mo better (like that)
Niggas just down for whatever, whatever
Come on, like that
Shhhh, let it go, let it flow[Static/Major - Intro]

For you to do, all I want for you to do is me, heh!
So dig that, find a shovel dig that

You can make 'em in fact, if you keep me intact, and

HEY![Intro: Twista (Static Major)]
(What happened to the slow jams in the club?)
Category F5, Twista, Static

[Hook: Static Major] (2x)
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her
So I can ease up on her
So I can get touchy feely (touchy feely)
Put a dip in your back
And get me one slow jam

Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her (creep up on her)
Everybody's trying to get with somethin'
Can I get one slow jam

[Verse 1: Twista]
When it come to ballin I do it with no hands
Left the Lamborghini home and took the Brougham (damn)
I think the club finna close man
But I be the Twista; you know how I be doing it with the slow jams
Take a look at the shawty chilling by the door man
I'm really into her persona cause she don't be taking drama
But she thick; when I ask her where she get it then she say she get it from her mama
So I think I'mma (what)
Pop champagne cause the glass tall
The bartender said it was the last call
I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance
And I can put my hands on her ass (yes)
And she like it when I hold and grip, control them hips
And you know I like it when she get low and dip
Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip
When they cut the lights on you gon roll with the Twist
Lookin so lovely in the fit you got on
But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you was in some jeans (nope)
Fragrance by Adidas, purse from another country, look at you, girl, you doin your thing!
Everybody leaving with somebody and I gotta get me somebody so I be doin' what I do
Gotta get me one too; before the night go I tell the maestro "that's your cue!"

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Static Major]
When I get on my way to the floor
Baby, hold on to my shoulders
Girl, I won't let you fall
Just hold on to my shoulders

[Verse 2: Twista]
She was lookin nice
Too hot for the Cardi, yeah, she'll melt the ice
Lil mama kinda like Rihanna, she was livin the life
She be givin advice
But just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device
What's that for?  Is your man a boy?
Cause he don't know how to give you what you're here for
I think I gotta show you what the pilot gear for
And the question is "What I'll whisper in your ear for?"
You nasty, love to be on top
Mad if I pop, if you miss the drop
You nasty, how you made me choke you
Told me I can put it anywhere I want to
Sex so good she do it with no hands
I met you while the DJ was playin the slow jam
As soon as we got into it (into the slow dance)
Is the beginnin of when I was feelin the romance
Now I be Twista with the super tight flow, one might go, that's so true
I gotta get me one; before the night go I tell the maestro "that's your cue!"

[Hook]

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Static Major] (2x)
What happened to the slow jams in the club?
The DJs don't play them anymore
I used to meet the ladies on the floor
And wait for the DJ to play oneShe smelt like a rose,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  even down in her sure,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  she offered a smile even on the day she was down.

I go in hard at the grand Casin-a
Flippin chips to all my mamamitas
..let me see you shake your kiesta

[Lil' Wayne]
Check it, shawty do what I want
Who I want, how I want
The way I want, when I want
Even when I don't and now I do
So gimme you, all I want
For you to do, and all I want
For you to do, all I want for you to do is me, heh!
So dig that, find a shovel dig that
I say I'll just take the hit and you can take the weed back
You can make 'em in fact, if you keep me intact, and
I'll just play the friend, I got dem goons in the back

[Hook]

HEY![Hook: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Shawty, she ain't never meet a nigga like Ace
The way she give me face is amazing grace
They say they love my swag when I drag in the place
And I'm waving at them haters cause I'm highin' out of space
And them bitches know the business poppin' Rosa by the case
The women try to get, get, get me before I get away
They pullin' on my dreads they rubbin' on my chest
The whisper in my ear like they wanna have sex
I'm like shawty wait in line, she like baby I'm next
See mama wanna fuck now she drunk off in the club
Come kick it like it's soccer baby fucking with a thug
I'm feelin' like Usher making love up in this club

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
And shawty wanna lick, lick, lick, lick me like a lollipop
I can make her body rock, she want my ass like candy drop
Favourite colour chocolate I'm melting like an ice pop
Pull up in that white drop all them bitches mouth drop
Now they wanna lick me 'till they get me to that centre spot
Let me see you drop it like you muthafucking panties hot
Groupie sex is so delicious now I got to dose it
Li-li-li-li-lick me 'till your tongue reach numbness
And let that tongue ring be really worth something
Say she want to fuck with her hand on her pumpkin
Well trick or treat I give 'em lollipops for coming
Lick, lick, lick, lick lick me shawty whisper what you want

[Hook]She smelt like a rose,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  even down in her sure,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  she offered a smile even on the day she was down.                                                                                                                                                                                     She captured a room, something like a princess would do.                                                                                                                                                                           Cause the light that shined on her always came through.                                                                                                                                                                         Sweet like an angel, that's what I remember.                                                                                                                                                                                             And any time you was with you, you'd never want it to end, yeah yeah.                                                                                                                                                       And she felt like a sister Cause you knew you could trust her (yes you could).                                                                                                                                               she'd never discarry you, she only tried to encourage you.

[Hook]
You'll get fire lovin all night if you were my girl
One position at a time if you were my girl
Fire lovin all night if you were my girl
One position at a time if you were my girl
(I tried to tell that we won't stop)(x4)

[Verse 1]
We might go catch a movie
Or a dinner for two, me and you
Have a bottle of Louis sitting on the table
You know I got them pesos
I'll take you around the world
If you were my girl
We would stay in five star hotels
I'm not stingy, but I want you all to myself

[B-Sec 1]
Cause when we turn off the lights and light a candle
You make me wanna hit a high note
Like "Oooo whooa whooa whooa"
Kiss your body soft and slow
While I'm taking off your clothes
We listen to slow love songs
The feeling is oh so strong

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me be your masseuse
Call you, sip some Goose
Make you relax and make your body feel loose
Drip drip drop like a water faucet
Put a few skeletons in your closet
Cause my body's calling for you
I don't see nothing wrong
If we bump and grind all night long

[B-Sec 2]
I'ma take you to the boom boom room
I'm like zoom zoom zoom
Kisses like ooo ooo ooo
Shawty, I'll give you the business
If you give me the digits
Won't you be my boo?

[Hook][Intro: Twista (Static Major)]
(What happened to the slow jams in the club?)
Category F5, Twista, Static

[Hook: Static Major] (2x)
Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her
So I can ease up on her
So I can get touchy feely (touchy feely)
Put a dip in your back
And get me one slow jam

Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one, yeah
So I can creep up on her (creep up on her)
Everybody's trying to get with somethin'
Can I get one slow jam

[Verse 1: Twista]
When it come to ballin I do it with no hands
Left the Lamborghini home and took the Brougham (damn)
I think the club finna close man
But I be the Twista; you know how I be doing it with the slow jams
Take a look at the shawty chilling by the door man
I'm really into her persona cause she don't be taking drama
But she thick; when I ask her where she get it then she say she get it from her mama
So I think I'mma (what)
Pop champagne cause the glass tall
The bartender said it was the last call
I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance
And I can put my hands on her ass (yes)
And she like it when I hold and grip, control them hips
And you know I like it when she get low and dip
Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip
When they cut the lights on you gon roll with the Twist
Lookin so lovely in the fit you got on
But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you was in some jeans (nope)
Fragrance by Adidas, purse from another country, look at you, girl, you doin your thing!
Everybody leaving with somebody and I gotta get me somebody so I be doin' what I do
Gotta get me one too; before the night go I tell the maestro "that's your cue!"

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Static Major]
When I get on my way to the floor
Baby, hold on to my shoulders
Girl, I won't let you fall
Just hold on to my shoulders

[Verse 2: Twista]
She was lookin nice
Too hot for the Cardi, yeah, she'll melt the ice
Lil mama kinda like Rihanna, she was livin the life
She be givin advice
But just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device
What's that for?  Is your man a boy?
Cause he don't know how to give you what you're here for
I think I gotta show you what the pilot gear for
And the question is "What I'll whisper in your ear for?"
You nasty, love to be on top
Mad if I pop, if you miss the drop
You nasty, how you made me choke you
Told me I can put it anywhere I want to
Sex so good she do it with no hands
I met you while the DJ was playin the slow jam
As soon as we got into it (into the slow dance)
Is the beginnin of when I was feelin the romance
Now I be Twista with the super tight flow, one might go, that's so true
I gotta get me one; before the night go I tell the maestro "that's your cue!"

[Hook]

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Static Major] (2x)
What happened to the slow jams in the club?
The DJs don't play them anymore
I used to meet the ladies on the floor
And wait for the DJ to play one[Verse 1]
Can I take you to the old school..

If I was your man
Girl I'll spoil you all the time
Woh-oh~oh
First thing in the morning

I still be checking on ya
And seeing if we
Can get a little closer
Baby can I come over
I'll be a special kind of friend
I'll be a special kind of lover

You know I'll be there
I'll be there when you wake up
I'll be there in the evening time
I'll be there, be there, be there
Even when you need me

[Chorus]
I know a lot of girls
Said I been all around the world
Still I keep running back
Running back, running back to ya
I can't put my finger on it
Cuz it's something, something
Something got me running back
Running back, running back to ya

[Verse 2]
See the seasons may change
But I'll remain the same
Even through stormy weather
Can we be together
I wanna know where I stand
Because I wanna be your man
Said I wanna hold and kiss your hand
Will that be alright
One of these nights
Can I put you on a high
Cloud nine is right around the corner

[Chorus]
I know a lot of girls
Said I been all around the world
Still I keep running back
Running back, running back to ya
I can't put my finger on it
Cuz it's something, something
Something got me running back
Running back, running back to ya

[Hook]
Honey love, honey love
I can't wait to get back to my honey love
What I'm serving up
Butter love, butter love
I can't wait to get back to my butter love
I can't get enough

[Chorus]
I know a lot of girls
Said I been all around the world
Still I keep running back
Running back, running back to ya
I can't put my finger on it
Cuz it's something, something
Something got me running back
Running back, running back to ya[Verse 1:]

Like the homeless in the road
I'm starving in my soul
They can't get me to go
If there is no you

Just like a rose
I sat and watched us grow
And you never hear me low
I know this love is true
We've seen it through
It's crazy like the blues
And I've always stuck with you
I want to help share your love
It can't be sold
It can't be priced with gold
And you've always took control
Right now I know...

[Hook:]

I'm on steady ground when you're around
(See you always bring comfort to me)
I'm on precious ground when you're around
(And you've always been so precious to me)
I'm on protected ground when you're around
(Because I always feel so safe around you)
I'm on steady ground when you're around
(And I always feel this way when you're around)

[Verse 2:]

When you're around
You hold it down
You put it down
Piece of the ground
You changed my frown give yourself a pound
When love's tuned loud
The sweetest sound
Always there when I...

[Hook x2]

Ain't no doubt in my mind
Guess I can't stop destiny
Got to be the best for me
From love you cannot run
Even under the gun
At the end of the day
No use looking around
Right now I'm on steady ground
Ain't no doubt in my mind
Guess I can't stop destiny
Got to be the best for me
From love you cannot run
Even under the gun
At the end of the day
No use looking around
Right now I'm on steady groundIntro:
Yeah, we gonna bust it a little something like this. Me and my nigga Mr
Dalvin. First let me get some weed before I wreck it. Just lay back

Static:
Where the reefer at, where the reefer at?
Run me in the dime, not trying to bust my head
Cause I stays on top of mine (top on mine)
Cause I been ballin' since the days of back when
Niggas wasn't be thinkin' about drink no juice and gin (alright brother)
Niggas be drinkin' the Thunderbird or Nighttrain
Lookin' for the right frame, breakin' like a dice game
Stackin' skrilla so I'm sippin' Hennessy
Lickin' shot after shot at my enemies
Boom boom recognize all persuers been in the game for years
Cause I'm a sho connoisseur
Consume the blocks, drop off my rocks, the quicker a nigga play me
The quicker a nigga who drops, pops of the Glocks
Not trippin' facial experessions, be shittin'
Niggas don't be hearin' all that in every city
Take a nigga out if you gotta on the day to day
Then parlay, ate a gator, parlay, to God nigga

Hook:
It ain't hare to see, when niggas try to be like me
A true O.G., y'all y'all, gotta take you underground
Parlay all day with the niggas from the Bassment sound  (X2)

Mr. Dalvin:
Watch out for I blow, swing low
Forget it, y'all don't hear me though, I'm hittin' switches
Hoppin' like a 64, and I, thought you knew, what I can do
Able to leap tall buildind and run up to your crew (oooooh)
The underground stylistical, got more flavors than mystics
So lay back and watch this nigga kick it
Wicked without thinkin' of funky
But I ain't stinkin', I know I got you open cause I got y'all niggas
Blinkin'
Check it out, you watch me devastate this track
I make stacks and stacks and leave niggas on they backs
Cause I...be a sharp shooter, intruder
Rugged and rough, poppin' off just like a lueger
Now how many niggas, wanna get down, while I say
With Jodeci or the Bassment sound, around
I don't wanna see, handin', my crew is deep and you know that we be bangin'
So give me a bottle of Boons so watch me load my gat
Start a war like Tom Barringer in Platoon
So, don't mess with this flow, Mr. Dalvin is gone like 19 nigga fiz-o, oh

Hook

Come on get down (repeated after every line)
This goin' out to all the players
Shoot outs to the ballers
Much love to the hustlers (all around the world)
Mo power to the pimps
Watch the Bassment make it mo better (like that)
Niggas just down for whatever, whatever
Come on, like that
Shhhh, let it go, let it flow
