It's Time, it's time, it's time, it's time
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 1: Mic Geronimo
I format my mind for combat
In fact I put a hole up in your back on the song like that
Rollin thick with my people ain't no room to breathe
Surrounded by murderous felons, drinks and bags of weed
I swing at ya and get fly with the M-I
I'm automatic trample in your static with the semi
So when I squeeze I'm off in the breeze with these
Licking shots at them whack MC's
With no direction, I rhyme with perfection skills
Drug a nigga like a pill when it's time to build
Keep it real, get your head rocked when I wreck shop
I bigger with my style ain't a bully on your fuckin block
Word is bond I go on
I'm breaking MC's with vocal tones over real rap songs
Insane in the brain nothing left to gain
Grab the mic up with skill when it's time to build, Mother Fuckers

Chorus:
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 2: Ja Rule
Niggas increase the pain when they shout my name
Horrified by the thought of hot slugs and graves
Cause Ja is a sinister character loading that 44 caliber
Infrared aimed at your jugular
Who the fuck are you? Nobody cares
You just be another nigga that needs repairs
Talking to all them niggas shitting
And all them faggots that be steady bitching, inside their insides twitching
Sod sill delivering, DOA push a nine to your mind and commence the spray
No bullshit, Natural's the king of left
Scared of life but wanna play the game of death
What's next? Niggas wearing padded kotex
Pussy ass MC's get treated like rough sex
I'm possessed you can't feel what I feeler
Be easy on the cut, uh, uh, uh

Chorus:
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 3: Jay-Z
Yeah, fresh on the scene-a with the fucking next niggas demeanor
You know my work I bless and press more skirts then the cleaners
I'm damn relaxed cause you cats can't stress the G
Ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me
Gone, niggas is moist like Duncan Hienz
Choice when I'm voicing my poise I got poison lines
So flame on I turn my game on the expert
Niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network
Fuck what you niggas kickin on the mic
You chicken like you don't know what an ass whippin feels like
I'm living flashbacks, I blaze niggas split like ass-cracks
It's the J to the A, smoother than jazz tracks, yeah
So when I'm browsing through your housing projects
Niggas get 5,000 shit is rough
Time to close I hit you with 16 of those
Next time maybe more, but who the fuck knows?

Chorus:
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 4: DMX
Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo
I'm peeling niggas caps like oranges
Hit 'em in the head with 2 by 4 inches
I'm a grimy nigga so I like my bitches cruddy
My clothes dirty, dick shitty, and my knife bloody
I did too much dirt to turn back now
I'm the reason my lil' sister smoking crack now
I'd feel guilty if I had a heart but I don't
To live a carefree life if I stop killing but I won't
It's in my blood to destroy man kind
With every murder I lose it little more of my damn mind
And I ain't got much left to lose nigga ,so don't snooze nigga
I'm telling yous nigga, just pay your dues nigga
Respect my mother fucking style of rap
Murder your mic and your unborn child
This ain't wild just how niggas living on the street
A little something that can't be beat

Chorus:
It's Time, it's time, it's time, it's time
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

[ VERSE 1: DMX ]
What's all the noise about, have some respect, shut the fuck up
Drive-by, money talkin shit, yo, back the truck up
Y'all niggas don't respect me but you fear me
And fear is better than respect, y'all niggas hear me
If I smack the shit out this nigga, his man over here be like, "Yo
What nigga, what," but his man is like "Psych, yo"
Can get from one extreme to the next
And my shit always bounce like DM to the X
I can bring it from up here: "Enough is enough!"
Down to: "Aight, I think it's safe to take off the cuffs"
Play with words, blurs and slurs, flip styles
Take his and hers, niggas is cursed, I get wild
So don't make me angry, you won't like me when I'm angry
I met a lot of enemies and they all like to thank me
Catch me when I'm sleepin with one eyed closed
One guy chose to doze, left one guy froze filled with hoes

[ VERSE 2: Ja Rule ]
It ought to be a long time before they touch this here
It's Gotti's consigliere, let's take it there, make a mill a year
Push Bentleys, ice drippin off the jewels daily
Ja the one, what, y'all don't hear me?
Nigga, y'all remember, CMC 95 December
Fine women, illegal tender, such is life
When I feel like I ain't to be held, who can hold me?
Hoes try to console me, rec execs wanna own me
Damn if I die slowly, drugged out, broke and lonely
Like so many who pushed roadie before me
Ja hit em precisely, God just don't make too many like me
Inadvertenly shittin on the top 20
Y'all niggas kill me, talkin like y'all can't be touched
See, by the time y'all realize I be done touched you up
Blazed you up, your whole style chump, nigga, what
Think again if you thought if I thought I give a fuck

[ VERSE 3: Jadakiss & Styles ]
Yo, it's pitiful, everything's political
But I got more rounds now, so all y'all can get a few
You know the shit that we be on, the three on
'Must be the money' like Deion that we see on
Players, you pop shit, I rather pop shells
Twist l's, blow chats with the rap cartels
Nigga, one nation under gutter (aha)
LOX style (yeah) I bring it to your mother
Christ, you get iced if you fuck with my brother
You know who run New York, so bump the undercovers
Yeah, it's a family affair, you find it rare
My niggas stick together and none of us care
We ain't got time for cages, doin ages
Thinkin of my crew holdin my two razors
Lockin in, lockin out, I play the block
Poppin up, poppin out, I like to shout
I get the finest clothes, top of the line guns
Honeys sellin crack, put this pack on your son
It ain't my fault I want a vault full of money
This shit is dead real, I seen a nigga shoot a honey
Now who's to blame when you bleed, ain't no answer
If it ain't a bullet, then I'mma die from cancer
Puff out till my lungs is gone
And nigga, it's a war till the guns is gone

[ VERSE 4: Tragedy Khadafi ]
Yeah... yo
Giuliani showed me to hell's another level
Blessed by Allah, possessed by the devil
Born in this crime I was sworn to do
Slayin you fake thugs that's performin too
I'mma bleed 25 till my dying day
Sprayin a AK till this world decay
If the feds wanna stay, we gon' make them pay
Cursin they whole life till they old and grey
In the name of the Father and the Holy Spirit
Will they murder me in hell, crucify my lyrics?
Only time ever tells and I know that you feel it
All my niggas in the cell, yo, I'm with you in spirit
Nothin nice 'bout a nigga when he doin his bids
Comin home to the next man raisin your kids
To my thugs in the Bridge, hold your head
Cause niggas is gon' feel it till they cold and dead

[ VERSE 5: Mic Geronimo ]
Runnin with five niggas, criminal disguised niggas
The live niggas, pull a mac, what, surprise niggas
Holdin my mic stiletto-like
Invitin these waterhead niggas to get splashed back and take it light
Slided back when we're 16 my mellow my brother
Told me lay it back, aced back and play it mellow
Seein how I'm a young Othello
Don't confuse me with them brothers who lost playin black De Niro
A boss with this, gettin tossed with Cris
The gorgeous shit, we ballin flawlessly
Whatever y'all brothers try, but never to touch me
The god, heated up beyond the frequency
Now it's time to put you niggas under pressure, we form
Here I am, if it's on then it's on
If the world was yours, could you keep it from a nigga like me?
Hold your head, we about to see...
Muthafucka

Usual Suspects

What y'all thought I was gone

It's Vendetta
Y'all'll seeArtist: Mic Geronimo
Album: The Natural
Song: Masta I.C

Intro
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die

Verse 1
Behold the uncontrollable
I keep the whole world in drama
Smoke my competition now they just a bag of skama
Imma reload the vocab that Manson used
Now amateurs will play to O.J
And wonder why they lose
I subdued the microphone and left it in submission
Then cracked the philly open
And found a talent that was hidden
I kid no man is similar to mental migraine
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game
It's been a long time maybe too long
Since your audio produced a real rap song
I mock a man who's fountain on a jack up in the plan
He can scan but didn't analyze the whole pro jam
I took my time I found I couldn't wait to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

Chorus [Repeat x4]
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die

Verse 2
The new and improved
You can't make a move
Or elude the feud about to be cued
A soloist journey through the mist now found
Assassinate the sound with choke by the pound
Make my own type of home on the phone
MC's reachin' for my style I'll leave alone
My terminology and odyssey known to man
And counteract the sham I'm cooler than a fan
Split the fission I cut with precision
So many tried before but still couldn't get in
Now it's on
No need to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

Chorus [Repeat x4]

I'm high 'til I die so there's no need to lie
Pass that metal over to the small guy
Kickin' inside from desire
Mils will be the ammos all explodin' on the mic to fuel the fire
I'm lifted off of my wig like terrific
Target every market move on each one specific
Overload the frame but keep it all the same
The Masta I.C. enters now in the game
Play me and try to get away that's a maybe
Be da foe and I'mma hold a 9 to ya lady
Our style's like a weapon
I hit the untrue
No need for me to come stalkin' lookin' for you
I rip through ya heart and bust through ya veins
I guarantee that things will never ever be the same
I kicked it on the real and now I keep it on the plane
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya brain
I'm so high...

Chorus [Repeat x4][Method Man]
Now I walked on ice, and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
Judge a phenomena, deadly but calm world in my palm
Dead by dawn got the right to bear arms, bring me along
Another sound boy dying, hot iron
Stuff flyin, out the hardware appliance
Baby, Momma Crying'
Sobbin' and grievin', you was at odds
With them kids, till they made it even
Let down your guard, yes you did
Now you barely breathin'
To win a whim, open season on a duck
We don't give a what
Yo, best, best to give it up
Joe and D, lets run these MCs, they phony
From Humphrey, they made Bogey
Saddle up your horse, there's the sunset Mosey
Jam-Master Jay deserves a trophy for this track right
Futuristic G past tight
If that's your girlfriend, she wasn't last night, punk
Little boy style's is mad chump, ain't no wins here
Sport is extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalties, Down with the King...!

[DMX]
Uhh, uhh
If Im gonna rob, ima rob all night
If Im lookin for somethin its probably a fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play ima play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep A spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?

[Xzibit]
I'm on a path not thinkin bout a average man
Black Sedan my way through pitfalls and scams
Let the whole world know about this Likwit king
Programmed to ignite on site
So now I'm standin in a whole new light (whole new light)
In a area where niggas ain't tryin to fight (tryin to fight)
I feel my jaw get tight (jaw get tight)
It's like, these niggas get pumped up, and lick shots
At you, and yours, plus the motherfuckin cops
We got, blocks and blocks of non-stop hustle
21 backdrop, it's my turn to shuffle
Stay alert little pussy on the side can't hurt
Wear protection from the heats, so I don't get burnt
I got no time to be a star (*echoes star, star, star*)
I go straight from the car to the bar, and then get busy
Whenever provoked, I react like Bill Bixby
Incredible heat, X-to the-Z
And 'The Infamous' Mobb Deep, take it to the street
Don't waste my time (waste my time)
Tryin to disrepect me in your half-assed rhyme
(half-assed rhyme) that ass is mine
Been goin down like this since the beginnin of time
Eyes may shine[Hook 2X: Mic Geronimo + Royal Flush]
It go one for all my people in the pen doing time
Stupid niggas that was force to do a life of livin crime
If you gotta do, whatever, just to keep a little cheddar
(Makin Moves y'all, Makin Moves y'all)

[Royal Flush]
I'm going thru the levels of hell, where life get token by a drug sale
Weigh ya grams on ya scale, holdin block for real
Shootin niggas out to kill, savin money for bail
While the taxes make ya squeal, beat you down til you ill
It's a struggle muthafucka, when you walk wit ya steel
While the base heads lookin for someone that deal
While my man Ryan died tryin to eat his last meal
Seen it come and go, many succeed, but some bleed
Goin day by day, carryin works like a disease
Do you get the picture, the basic fact, why we strapped?
While little kids kidnapped, and cars get jacked
Bring it to a man that could never help you wit that
I'm on the road to the riches, bitches countin my stack
Keep the red eyes, and shootin bullets back to back
Hypnotize smoke 'n lye, sometime it feels like pipe
I gotta get mind, you gotta get yours, by all cause

[Hook 2X]

[Royal Flush]
That's why I sit back and smoke my reefer listen what the Gods teach ya
Fuck a preacher, holdin guns'll greet ya
Streets make it hard to survive, so most die
Some niggas is paralyzed, catchin slugs in they spine
Due to mankind, holdin my nine, commitin crimes
Sometime my mind relax, leave the block then come back
It's all infested with cracks and little kids packin gat
Bitches fuckin for stacks, New York is wild like that
Perhaps you got an open case judge in ya face
Sister made a mistake, got you layin upstate
5 to 15, holdin ya ox, from gettin wop
While somebody else fuckin ya girl right on ya block
(Rock - cause it never stop)
Niggas bustin that cops for props
These streets is hot, sawed-off shotguns and weed spots
Snitches that eavesdrop, first of all started hard rocks
Stealin outta car, last night they talk nonstop (Word)

[Hook 2X]

Word up, wasteland (wasteland) wasteland (wasteland)
Shit's real (wasteland)
You nahmsayin (wasteland)
Beat the nigga Royal Flush (now hold up - wasteland)
Get money by all means (wasteland)
Wasteland (wasteland)
Welcome to '96 (nahmean)
Buckwild (wasteland), Buckwild (waste..)Mic Geronimo:
Uhh, yea. Its a hies nigga come on

DMX:
Work hard for the money(4x)
Since we gots to rob something its definitely gonna be worth it
Inside job lettin you peep from the surface
But can a nigga live
Hold me down and I gotcha
I'd hate to have on my chonchus that I shot ya
With out you I wouldn't be here
So lets get doe together
But first you got to let me know ?
Is you bustin off or is you just holdin a gun
When you should be here are you there rollin a blunt
My ribs is touchin
I need this little bit of money more than you think
That who think two niggas would think two hours could hit two banks
Is you ready for the big time
This is a big crime that I'm commitin
And I'm sure there'll be casualties because this time is slippin
But I'm forgettin what I'm there for
It's all about the money
Fuck how many lives are lost
It's all about the money
And ain't nuthin funny about the brains on the walls
Come on, load up the truck get it all

Chorus(Mic Geronimo)[DMX]:
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it bloom]

Black Rob:
Yo this banks perfectly fitted for dues like us to hit it
X must I see, you know I'm wit it
Never felt remours when a wit got splitted
Huh, its money involved so lets go get it
I know ya niggas coppin shit loud
The get away cars to kill when it's time to get wild
Down the conner rollin sparkin the beef
I want the heat
And them fellas fars up the same chalkin sheet
They know how I get down X, when they flex
Force me to put something hot in they chest
I lay to rest
The transcretion from the door
My four four (?) when I'm on war
One floor
And that's it we history
And I can't have Diamond and Rob forgettin me
It's all enough to like Joe
Fuck that and we all know god it ain't nuthin like dough

Chorus(Mic Geronimo)[Black Rob]:
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom]

Mic Geronimo:
Its the hies of a life time stake imposed
Any heads get in the way the nigga aim the thougs
And as for the gats that we hold, make you rain we those
Once it starts every shout in the chamber blows
It's a job with posistion and deadly accuracy
And needed as much as ammo in the kevlar 3
I'ma blaze shit to ya if blaze for me
You ready to die for this paper the same as me
Know think about, just 120 minutes to rock
Any room for that will take away from minutes we got
And what I'm know about to be is not
Facin the judge
Rather die holdin wit a bag acein the slugs
Where I'm at is where a elato sadate me from stress
But never the less, I'm ready here to go with the best
With the jake tryin to gun me and takin my life from me
It's funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money

Chorus(Mic Geronimo)(5x):
Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money[Puffy]
Aha aha yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Keep it movin' come on and keep it movin' [X4]

[Mic Geronimo]
Pimped out shine, boss to a tee
Ask yourself can you ball like me
It's nothin that an amatuer can try to see
Even hoes with the most step carefully, around me
Abide by the rules you know
Disturb my groove and you gots to lay low
Geronimo have it in the cut hogged tied
Fucked up staring at gats from both sides
I stay high puff a pound or so
Spearing the dough, accordly we run it
How it go? Can't nobody hold me down
Like my nigga Puff say, cut so sharp, you
Think we sensei, Ima break it down audio display
With some help from the Bad Boys mic don't play
Frontin' on my crew nigga crime don't pay
We back in ya face kickin' dirt all day
Protege niggas that rhyme, don't try
It's a fact, you've been hitted by the Master-I

Emcees wanna gun me and take my life from me
It's funny but still ain't nothin' move but the money
It's on...

[Chorus]
Times are hard? Times are rough? Feelin' like you had
Enough, we can make it, gotta try
Make a change, live your life

[Mic Geronimo]
Struggle for years is gone, I'm back fully on
With the tracks with the plagues we get illy on
Niggas carry on while I'll place in funds
And makin' some, the value it make 'em run
Grams and tons of rhymes, if you coppin one
Let your man know, make sure he rockin one
Here it is in the cut, clientelle at the throat
The bomb shit blowin' like a bag of choke
Mad you wrote a verse but it just don't fit
Writtin' that shit with the niggas you running
To roll with, I told y'all Imma control
The world with this, microphone like a anthem, it just
Don't miss give me somethin' to run with I'm on the block
All the niggas we hold you see they underlocked, still

Emcees wanna gun me and take my life from me
It's funny but still ain't nothin' move but the money
It's on...

[Chorus]
Times are hard? Times are rough? Feelin' like you had
Enough, we can make it, gotta try
Make a change, live your life

[Mic Geronimo]
Geronimo got it locked up like HDM, blowin' the
Twenty with shortie in the grey B.M
Gettin dirty after dark like 4 AM and strokin'
My little mami 'til her body say when
I'm more amazing then a Spielberg flick mix it with
A little bit of the Tarantino shit, Y'all need to
Quit while you're movin' ahead, see we stoppin'
On the bank up in the game, enough said
A team so strong what can stop me now
Y'all niggas better hope y'all top me now, and still

Emcees wanna gun me and take my life from me
It's funny but still ain't nothin' move but the money
It's on...

[Chorus]

Can't you see that what I mean is the mon-ey
Can't you see...

[Chorus 3X]

[Puff]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Blunt records, Bad Boy collabo
Yeah I seeEverybody wanna be like Mic
Everybody wanna be like Mic

Yo, I believe I can fly

Master divisor, colder as I grew wiser
Fool the world like Keyser, see they stuck 85ers
With science, move and use complete silence
Niggas are God recognizin that we run earth with iron
I'm here, but I still ain't seen nobody come near
To the heat so severe it leave you scorched from a flare
Bustin two up in the air, then the rest you got
And God forbid these niggas ever make my hustlin stop
When I drop it's only to put it to excellency status
See, we here to run it all with eight other planets
But I'm on till it's gone, understand it
Performin to the warm hugs and slugs and feel the storm kinda tragic
Magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much
All abuzz how we do it, how we touchin the sky
Holdin more, this is for all of y'all wonderin why
I can fly

Everybody wanna be like Mic
Everybody wanna be like Mic

Yo, I believe I can fly

Lexus and Benzes every color
Push a Hummer in the butters
Go to Miami in the summer months
Crush ice Rolly seemed like my brother once
Chillin on my arm, dippin in my pocket
Hold a 40, Benz inside my palms
Duplexes, east and west coast, plus the flats
Everybody know we get it on like that
With assorted firearm bulletproof to match
Teflon ??? my fitting baseball hat
While my ladies carry .380s in front of they snatch
And we makin all this caper but never givin it back
It's amazin how I put it all together with rap
1000s of listeners everywhere that fall on the map
See, it's magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much
All abuzz how we do it, how we touchin the sky
Holdin more, this is for all of y'all wonderin why
I can fly

Everybody wanna be like Mic
Everybody wanna be like Mic

Yo, I believe I can fly

Either you down or you isn't in this game for the wins
Stackin the compensates and livin straight for the ends
Hittin skins, luxury Sedans with the rims
Fuckin with Washingtons while I'm holdin on the Benz
Pen's like a lens, so it's clear
Bless you in your dome with the chrome
Bring the flavor to your ear
Appear to make these willies reconsider the fear
Rhymin for nothin these niggas shouldn't try to come near
See, it's magic what I'm doin, anybody get touched
Everybody suffer the feelings of loss too much
All abuzz how we do it, how we touchin the sky
Holdin more, this is for all of y'all wonderin why

Everybody wanna be like Mic
Everybody wanna be like Mic

I believe I can fly[Hook]
Illiodic Shine, just like a palace
Now, release the violence
Heat lay 'em down, off of balance
Snitchin murder comes, when you deal wit the guns
Turn a nigga to sons, extortin makin the funds

[Mic Geronimo]
Hold the diamondback, release the artist like a quarterback
Or the mack, I caught a black and blue from the trouble at
I stash ones, shoot a legal guns family
Who on the run, did the felony counts, and murder one
A hustle, niggas livin from bundle to bundle
And jungle cats smuggle from the Virginia to the cypher

[Royal Flush]
And stack it never, these Queens niggas run is thorough
And got it lock, takin over blocks wit loose rocks
Makin happen hops, bitch ass niggas that call cops
Scared of static, my 44 bustin straight through you cabbage
First is batting average, I'm civilizin, you'se a savage
Street habits, ya niggas is feminine like faggots

[Mic Geronimo]
Behold the automatic, mahogany hand on the steam
On who glass fiend, I'm comin straight from Queens
Organize on the fiends, double up on you team
Bust an empty and fill you up inside wit eighteen

[Royal Flush]
Strictly for the cream, smack em wit the heat, watch them bleed
Who you tryin to see, Flush and Mic G., your worst enemy

[Mic Geronimo]
Readily down a double shots of Hennesey
Illegal mercenary, diversify, revolutionary

[Hook]

[Royal Flush]
Start the combat, stay relax, dead nuts, never that
Keep the gat, actual facts, you get smacked
Verbally attack, yoke him from the back, where he comin at
He strapped, I'm strapped, bustin me, I'm bustin back

[Prince Kaysaan]
Don't want no problem God, I know you livin large
It was my man Todd, he send me on the job

[Royal Flush]
It wasn't hard to tell one of you niggas'll snitchin
Straight up and down, bitchin, real niggas in position
Tie 'em and down miss 'em, shootin thirty in 'em
Aiyo Kiko, wrap his body, throw it near the rowdy
They calico's and shotties, wifey pack ya bag and grab the Mazzarati
(What happen boo?) Just take my seed and lay low
In the Pocono, this nigga gotta, claim I owe him dough
(Do you baby?) Take your shit and go

[Royal Flush] (Mic Geronimo)
He pulled out a black Beemer, jumpin out wit his heat out
(Callin my team out, I came to work the fuckin beef out)
Yo fuck that God, where he live? (Not far)
Surveillance is car, niggas stay parked by the bar
(Aiyo, Allah, I'mma work it out, everything stabilize
Like him right between the eyes, blaze it till I'm 4 to 5
Slide back, push it to the 45 Marriot
Stoppin at the weed spot, fuck the cops
Can't see us both gettin locked
Nonstop, visionary prop)
He got shot, knew that bullshit had to stop
Plus the spots hots, lifted everything off his block
Clear picture, job well done, flip the scripture
(Mic the night ripper, bringin highs when I hit ya
Nigga I'm wit ya, and any beef will split ya)

[Hook 3X][Method Man]
Now I walked on ice, and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
Judge a phenomena, deadly but calm world in my palm
Dead by dawn got the right to bear arms, bring me along
Another sound boy dying, hot iron
Stuff flyin, out the hardware appliance
Baby, Momma Crying'
Sobbin' and grievin', you was at odds
With them kids, till they made it even
Let down your guard, yes you did
Now you barely breathin'
To win a whim, open season on a duck
We don't give a what
Yo, best, best to give it up
Joe and D, lets run these MCs, they phony
From Humphrey, they made Bogey
Saddle up your horse, there's the sunset Mosey
Jam-Master Jay deserves a trophy for this track right
Futuristic G past tight
If that's your girlfriend, she wasn't last night, punk
Little boy style's is mad chump, ain't no wins here
Sport is extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalties, Down with the King...!

[DMX]
Uhh, uhh
If Im gonna rob, ima rob all night
If Im lookin for somethin its probably a fight
If Im goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If thats dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play ima play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep A spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?

[Xzibit]
I'm on a path not thinkin bout a average man
Black Sedan my way through pitfalls and scams
Let the whole world know about this Likwit king
Programmed to ignite on site
So now I'm standin in a whole new light (whole new light)
In a area where niggas ain't tryin to fight (tryin to fight)
I feel my jaw get tight (jaw get tight)
It's like, these niggas get pumped up, and lick shots
At you, and yours, plus the motherfuckin cops
We got, blocks and blocks of non-stop hustle
21 backdrop, it's my turn to shuffle
Stay alert little pussy on the side can't hurt
Wear protection from the heats, so I don't get burnt
I got no time to be a star (*echoes star, star, star*)
I go straight from the car to the bar, and then get busy
Whenever provoked, I react like Bill Bixby
Incredible heat, X-to the-Z
And 'The Infamous' Mobb Deep, take it to the street
Don't waste my time (waste my time)
Tryin to disrepect me in your half-assed rhyme
(half-assed rhyme) that ass is mine
Been goin down like this since the beginnin of time
Eyes may shineSee, what I'm talkin bout here
Is love is life and life is love
And you can love bein a thug if you want
Ain't nothin wrong with that, nigga
But what you do will come back to you
You know
Check me out

Awoke but never ever dreamed it'd be the last time
Steamin and laughin with my niggas under sunshine
In my mind if I knew that my day would turn tragically wrong
I'da edited this shit and wrote a brand-new song
All I heard was the word of the wrath of God
Pointed at my chest, hollow tips in barrage
Stuck inside the middle, watched Allah pull my card
As he told me: 'Time is up for all you niggas livin hard'
Question: 'Why me?' Said: 'You couldn't see
Rather drink your Hennessy like you was watchin over ME
I was generous, hit you up a chance, time to change
But you rather be a knucklehead livin off a name'
Now I'm shocked as he explained it all, vivid in a tale
I'm feelin every minute like the blind feel the braille
Lost inside the shuffle of the bitches and the mail
He rolled up and told me: 'Inhale...'

To live or die by the same shit
Leavin behind everything that it came with
The verdict of a life niggas play with
Try the truth, it'll all come back to you

He said: 'I had a lotta hope for you' I said: 'I know you did'
Said: 'I couldn't see you on this road when you was just a kid
But I had to let you grow to man and use the brain I gave you
Thinkin maybe give this rap shit a crack and try to save you
You bein you, rather juggle with the crew
Find some drama, break the rules, spend your money on em jewels
And the tools that I gave you sat around and caught rust
While the tools them niggas hit you with, you turn around and bust'
It's disgusting, dropped my head, threw my hands in the air
Said: 'I know that all in all it seemed I never really cared'
Still and all I'm feelin scared and he said: 'You wasn't buggin
One of them nights you came prepared with baby-macs, started thuggin
Now it's time for you to see exactly what it means
When you're reapin what you're sowin in between...'
...know what I mean

I said: 'It's all said and done, showed the pictures, brought the facts'
Said: 'I tried to play it chill, but ain't no evidence to that
Bring me back and I'mma never do the same shit again
Word to mother, daughter, son, and all my peoples in the pen
Hope you're listenin, it's hard for me to beg someone for somethin'
Said: 'Your problem, that's fear, too much pride, steady frontin
If you took the time to think about the ends and what it means
Wouldn't find yourself a million somethin feet above the scenes
And I know they're goin through you, felt the pressure and the pain
It was all about the cream and all the props you had to gain
For the fame you sacrificed the love I showed, to play the game
Now you're just another reason why the shit'll stay the same
Now you chill with me forever, ain't nobody else to blame
And the only thing you left behind's a name
A shame you opened up your ears just a little late as I explain
You're just another nigga layin slain'[Hook 2X: Mic Geronimo + Royal Flush]
It go one for all my people in the pen doing time
Stupid niggas that was force to do a life of livin crime
If you gotta do, whatever, just to keep a little cheddar
(Makin Moves y'all, Makin Moves y'all)

[Royal Flush]
I'm going thru the levels of hell, where life get token by a drug sale
Weigh ya grams on ya scale, holdin block for real
Shootin niggas out to kill, savin money for bail
While the taxes make ya squeal, beat you down til you ill
It's a struggle muthafucka, when you walk wit ya steel
While the base heads lookin for someone that deal
While my man Ryan died tryin to eat his last meal
Seen it come and go, many succeed, but some bleed
Goin day by day, carryin works like a disease
Do you get the picture, the basic fact, why we strapped?
While little kids kidnapped, and cars get jacked
Bring it to a man that could never help you wit that
I'm on the road to the riches, bitches countin my stack
Keep the red eyes, and shootin bullets back to back
Hypnotize smoke 'n lye, sometime it feels like pipe
I gotta get mind, you gotta get yours, by all cause

[Hook 2X]

[Royal Flush]
That's why I sit back and smoke my reefer listen what the Gods teach ya
Fuck a preacher, holdin guns'll greet ya
Streets make it hard to survive, so most die
Some niggas is paralyzed, catchin slugs in they spine
Due to mankind, holdin my nine, commitin crimes
Sometime my mind relax, leave the block then come back
It's all infested with cracks and little kids packin gat
Bitches fuckin for stacks, New York is wild like that
Perhaps you got an open case judge in ya face
Sister made a mistake, got you layin upstate
5 to 15, holdin ya ox, from gettin wop
While somebody else fuckin ya girl right on ya block
(Rock - cause it never stop)
Niggas bustin that cops for props
These streets is hot, sawed-off shotguns and weed spots
Snitches that eavesdrop, first of all started hard rocks
Stealin outta car, last night they talk nonstop (Word)

[Hook 2X]

Word up, wasteland (wasteland) wasteland (wasteland)

Welcome to '96 (nahmean)
Buckwild (wasteland), Buckwild (waste..)Artist: Mic Geronimo
Album: The Natural
Song: Masta I.C

Intro
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die

Verse 1
Behold the uncontrollable
I keep the whole world in drama
Smoke my competition now they just a bag of skama
Imma reload the vocab that Manson used
Now amateurs will play to O.J
And wonder why they lose
I subdued the microphone and left it in submission
Then cracked the philly open
And found a talent that was hidden
I kid no man is similar to mental migraine
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game
It's been a long time maybe too long
Since your audio produced a real rap song
I mock a man who's fountain on a jack up in the plan
He can scan but didn't analyze the whole pro jam
I took my time I found I couldn't wait to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

Chorus [Repeat x4]
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die

Verse 2
The new and improved
You can't make a move
Or elude the feud about to be cued
A soloist journey through the mist now found
Assassinate the sound with choke by the pound
Make my own type of home on the phone
MC's reachin' for my style I'll leave alone
My terminology and odyssey known to man
And counteract the sham I'm cooler than a fan
Split the fission I cut with precision
So many tried before but still couldn't get in
Now it's on
No need to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

Chorus [Repeat x4]

I'm high 'til I die so there's no need to lie
Pass that metal over to the small guy
Kickin' inside from desire
Mils will be the ammos all explodin' on the mic to fuel the fire
I'm lifted off of my wig like terrific
Target every market move on each one specific
Overload the frame but keep it all the same
The Masta I.C. enters now in the game
Play me and try to get away that's a maybe
Be da foe and I'mma hold a 9 to ya lady
Our style's like a weapon
I hit the untrue
No need for me to come stalkin' lookin' for you
I rip through ya heart and bust through ya veins
I guarantee that things will never ever be the same
I kicked it on the real and now I keep it on the plane
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya brain
I'm so high...

Chorus [Repeat x4](New York, New York, New York, New York)

(In a New York, New York, New York, New York)

[Verse 1 - French Montana]
You can get your neck broke, face cracked, laid flat
And give everything that you made back, 8 clap
Make a sunvisor out ya wavecap
Pray that New York Minute'll bring Mase back
Shame that Remy took 8 flat, you know the game wack
And every last rapper here tryna bring the name back
It ain't rap, niggas better stay strapped
Or you could call the stick-up boys, try to get your chain back
(In a New York minute)
They thought the game was over
When B.I.G. died, then the homie Hov took it over
(In a New York minute)
They shot Pac 5 times
Years later, them boys took Shyne
(In a New York minute)
That ain't even the least
Akon signed the hottest nigga in the streets
We gave swagger to the game
Still and all, everything can change

Things could get pretty strange

(In a New York, New York, New York, New York)

[Verse 2 - Lil' Cease]
New York, shit's rotten in the Big Apple
Nicky barnes got his whole shit shackled
Play like a New York Giant then you can get tackled
The Big Apple is a story
He said let his son dry, bag it up in 40
Broke a little dime out and mixed it up with all the
Haha, and I'm from Brooklawn
Where niggas even look wrong, niggas get hooked on
(In a New York minute)
The home of The Lox (D-Block)
Even in LA they killed BIG Pop
(In a New York minute)
They killed Sean Bell
And I still think they killed John Gotti in the cell
(In a New York minute)
Where Pac got shot
Waitin' on Gutta, we just got back Roc
(In a New York minute)
We'll bring New York back
Drop Hypnotize, then see how New York act
(In a New York minute)

(In a New York, New York, New York, New York)

[Verse 3 - Mic Geronimo]
Nigga you can get ya stash took, cuff, booked
Waitin' in the bulb, and all of this over niggas who been talkin'
Rob while ya walkin' and cash ya check
But get the chain and the piece took from off ya neck
From the coupe to the coffin, laying in the morgue
Kuz envious nioggaz didn't get enough from extortion
Lost in the jungle
Tears over rappers who died like Freaky Tye, Big L, and Stack Bundles
(In a New York minute)
Shit, rappers ain't hot no more
Jay don't even fuck with Fox no more
(In a New York minute)
Yeah, what you never thought of was the Eastcoast dyin'
These other niggas get more love
(In a New York minute)
Label execs turning to rich ass junkies
Fuckin' the same moneys
(In a New York minute)
Niggas who forgot about
I spit 16 like Mikey bringin' the chopper out

(In a New York minute, minute)

[Verse 4 - N.O.R.E.]
So fix ya face when you speak of the Mecca, from Tribeca
The left rack, rock a mad hat, they expect that
I rep that, respect that, you can get sent back
Your jaw left on the sidewalk wit' a wet back
I'm a chef with the cocaine cookies, make 'em look pretty
Show you on a DVD with Cocaine City
Yo, Fat Cat, Pappy Mason, 'Preme nigga, my borough
Money Bagz, Chad, Lamar Odom owns my borough
(In a New York minute)
It's like we the most thorough
Orange tops, blue tops, even sold green and yellow
(In a New York minute)
In a New York minute
I'mma rep New York until I finish
(In a New York minute)
Don't use no gimmicks
Catch me on the block drinkin' New York Guiness
(In a New York minute)
Makin' New York spinach
I done did a bid, did a New York sentence

[Hook]
In a New York minute (Whoo-oooo)
Everything can change

Things could get pretty strange
In a New York minute (Whoo-oooo)
Everything can change
In a New York minute
(Whoo-oooo-oooh-oooh)
(In a New York, New York, New York, New York)

[Verse 5 - Jadakiss]
You could get your wig clapped, kidnapped, bitch-slapped
A 2 to 4 could turn into a 6 flat, if that
C-4 to your moms front door, gift-wrapped
Whole fanbase could start thinkin' that your shit's wack
You could be at the gas station and get ya whip jacked
Get yapped, pay a nigga bread, get ya shit back
Right back, everything could change, just like that
Get pulled over on your way bringin' that white back
(In a New York minute)
Rappers stopped sellin'
Kim did a year and a day for not tellin'
(In a New York minute)
Fox went deaf in one ear too, shortly after that she did a year or two
(In a New York minute)
I beat the case, not enough evidence
Get ready to see a black President
(In a New York minute)
You can download a whole album
Now you see where these niggas get their style from

[Hook]
In a New York minute (Whoo-oooo)
Everything can change
In a New York minute (Whoo-oooo)

(In a New York, New York, New York, New York)Mic Geronimo:
Uhh, yea. Its a hies nigga come on

DMX:
Work hard for the money(4x)
Since we gots to rob something its definitely gonna be worth it
Inside job lettin you peep from the surface
But can a nigga live
Hold me down and I gotcha
I'd hate to have on my chonchus that I shot ya
With out you I wouldn't be here
So lets get doe together
But first you got to let me know ?
Is you bustin off or is you just holdin a gun
When you should be here are you there rollin a blunt
My ribs is touchin
I need this little bit of money more than you think
That who think two niggas would think two hours could hit two banks
Is you ready for the big time
This is a big crime that I'm commitin
And I'm sure there'll be casualties because this time is slippin
But I'm forgettin what I'm there for
It's all about the money
Fuck how many lives are lost
It's all about the money
And ain't nuthin funny about the brains on the walls
Come on, load up the truck get it all

Chorus(Mic Geronimo)[DMX]:
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it bloom]

Black Rob:
Yo this banks perfectly fitted for dues like us to hit it
X must I see, you know I'm wit it
Never felt remours when a wit got splitted
Huh, its money involved so lets go get it
I know ya niggas coppin shit loud
The get away cars to kill when it's time to get wild
Down the conner rollin sparkin the beef
I want the heat
And them fellas fars up the same chalkin sheet
They know how I get down X, when they flex
Force me to put something hot in they chest
I lay to rest
The transcretion from the door
My four four (?) when I'm on war
One floor
And that's it we history
And I can't have Diamond and Rob forgettin me
It's all enough to like Joe
Fuck that and we all know god it ain't nuthin like dough

Chorus(Mic Geronimo)[Black Rob]:
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[I gots to make a move and make it soon]
(Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money)
[Yo I gots to take a block and make it boom]

Mic Geronimo:
Its the hies of a life time stake imposed
Any heads get in the way the nigga aim the thougs
And as for the gats that we hold, make you rain we those
Once it starts every shout in the chamber blows
It's a job with posistion and deadly accuracy
And needed as much as ammo in the kevlar 3
I'ma blaze shit to ya if blaze for me
You ready to die for this paper the same as me
Know think about, just 120 minutes to rock
Any room for that will take away from minutes we got
And what I'm know about to be is not
Facin the judge
Rather die holdin wit a bag acein the slugs
Where I'm at is where a elato sadate me from stress
But never the less, I'm ready here to go with the best
With the jake tryin to gun me and takin my life from me
It's funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money

Chorus(Mic Geronimo)(5x):
Ain't nuthin' funny, but still don't nuthin move but the money[Royal Flush]
It was a hot day, fuckin wit shorty round way
Diamond reflected off the white, clear E&J all day
The NSX pull out the driveway
Feelin like Scarface, desperado on the case
Niggas an ace, celebrate livin it great
Into your mind state, a lock front, but Flush straight
Over wound ya faith, hold it down across state
You know, fitted hat, Tommy shorts to match
Lay back, executioner of rap, that bring stat
Face the phat, tattoo on my arm, and pack gat
Never mind that, quick reflexes, I bust back
Party back to back, New York, where it's at
Hold up stop for a second, bring it back cousin
Let's have a good time, cipher wit the Dutch combine
Respect mine, that's why you live the deaf, dumb and the blind
Bottom line, let's all shine, can't be mad at what's mine
It took a lot to get these props, three shots and almost got rocked
My hustle on the roof top, the watch cop, and I'm gettin crazy cheddar
Drivin rose, Bentleys and better
The street contemplate the terror, the rhymes sever
And overdose speak broadcastin niggas leakin
Probably thinkin, I'm just a wise nigga drinkin

[Hook 2X]
Whatever you do, you gotta get ya shit straight
No time to wait, make money and regulate

[Mic Geronimo]
While on the mailbox, sit and steamin
Peep the demon, techs were schemin, seen it in they eyes gleamin
Sorta like the shine, 'cept the thoughts son divine
Run wild inside they minds, maybe had somebody by me
My body wit lacerations, cuts, abrasions
Wounds I couldn't slide, from when the bullets started blazin
Awaken from concentration, started to skate
My heart rate, amagortex wit no brakes
Jump the gate, hit the ground on my side, but no pain
Turn around and find her comin like a runaway freight train
And play you, I see blues and cars are too
Choose or lose, ain't no option in my everyday news
Grab the heat and slide, maybe jump up in the ride
Now my nigga Flush, he like lamped on the side
Strictly sorta Cajun, relax, mind lacin
Line cooperation, now to start activation
Ill collaboration, from a team now you facin
We break nation, flew back style afflatus
I only roll daily, wit the God burst heatin
Chill, a mass mill, lay back, leave it dubblin
Money for bubblin, from 95 thru recoverin
My crew smotherin, carry Benjamin's and jugglin

[Hook 4X][Verse 1]
Notoriously enterprising, vocals for analyzing
I move, defiant speech more deeper than Poseidon
Give me, the highest esteem like hundreds of cream
Lick a shot off like Spock with them laser beams
Its the, greatest vocabularian in era
My styles vary like leathers, niggas rocking the serum
Living forever 40 ki's couldn't measure to the treasure
From these pedigrees I flow larger than C's
Cristal and Dom-P, getting sexed in the 'telly
From bitches, who's in the running (how they look?) up with Halle Berry
I'm far from ordinary, I pitch a K like the arm of Satchel
Beware from the strength of the Natural

[Verse 2]
Now from below I die trying like a Japanese hero
Lyrics are Kilo's the outcome nothing but cee-lo's
Leave those, unprofessional pros alone
Enjoy the sound that's now emitting out the microphone
I'm every word personified, create astonishing lines
Go inside and pull a paragraph or two from my mind
Then decline the competition and recline inside the vision
Of uncanny type precision, hit 'em in all positions
Let it be known, my apparatus is stone
Inject the hyper tone inside the space between your headphones
I'm naturally grown, but leaving it sewn just like a surgeon
Money I'm splurging, that mean I got to leave it burning (right)
The simple fact, I'm like a Mac when I hit
Reality perceived to me, this ain't no counterfeit shit
Doing my thing-thing, I pitch a K like the arm of Satchel
Beware from the strength of the NaturalIt's Time, it's time, it's time, it's time
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 1: Mic Geronimo
I format my mind for combat
In fact I put a hole up in your back on the song like that
Rollin thick with my people ain't no room to breathe
Surrounded by murderous felons, drinks and bags of weed
I swing at ya and get fly with the M-I
I'm automatic trample in your static with the semi
So when I squeeze I'm off in the breeze with these
Licking shots at them whack MC's
With no direction, I rhyme with perfection skills
Drug a nigga like a pill when it's time to build
Keep it real, get your head rocked when I wreck shop
I bigger with my style ain't a bully on your fuckin block
Word is bond I go on
I'm breaking MC's with vocal tones over real rap songs
Insane in the brain nothing left to gain
Grab the mic up with skill when it's time to build, Mother Fuckers

Chorus:
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 2: Ja Rule
Niggas increase the pain when they shout my name
Horrified by the thought of hot slugs and graves
Cause Ja is a sinister character loading that 44 caliber
Infrared aimed at your jugular
Who the fuck are you? Nobody cares
You just be another nigga that needs repairs
Talking to all them niggas shitting
And all them faggots that be steady bitching, inside their insides twitching
Sod sill delivering, DOA push a nine to your mind and commence the spray
No bullshit, Natural's the king of left
Scared of life but wanna play the game of death
What's next? Niggas wearing padded kotex
Pussy ass MC's get treated like rough sex
I'm possessed you can't feel what I feeler
Be easy on the cut, uh, uh, uh

Chorus:
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 3: Jay-Z
Yeah, fresh on the scene-a with the fucking next niggas demeanor
You know my work I bless and press more skirts then the cleaners
I'm damn relaxed cause you cats can't stress the G
Ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me
Gone, niggas is moist like Duncan Hienz
Choice when I'm voicing my poise I got poison lines
So flame on I turn my game on the expert
Niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network
Fuck what you niggas kickin on the mic
You chicken like you don't know what an ass whippin feels like
I'm living flashbacks, I blaze niggas split like ass-cracks
It's the J to the A, smoother than jazz tracks, yeah
So when I'm browsing through your housing projects
Niggas get 5,000 shit is rough
Time to close I hit you with 16 of those
Next time maybe more, but who the fuck knows?

Chorus:
This is time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, it's time to build
It's time to build, this is time to build

Verse 4: DMX
Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo
I'm peeling niggas caps like oranges
Hit 'em in the head with 2 by 4 inches
I'm a grimy nigga so I like my bitches cruddy
My clothes dirty, dick shitty, and my knife bloody
I did too much dirt to turn back now
I'm the reason my lil' sister smoking crack now
I'd feel guilty if I had a heart but I don't
To live a carefree life if I stop killing but I won't
It's in my blood to destroy man kind
With every murder I lose it little more of my damn mind
And I ain't got much left to lose nigga ,so don't snooze nigga
I'm telling yous nigga, just pay your dues nigga
Respect my mother fucking style of rap
Murder your mic and your unborn child
This ain't wild just how niggas living on the street
A little something that can't be beat

[ VERSE 1: DMX ]
What's all the noise about, have some respect, shut the fuck up
Drive-by, money talkin shit, yo, back the truck up
Y'all niggas don't respect me but you fear me
And fear is better than respect, y'all niggas hear me
If I smack the shit out this nigga, his man over here be like, "Yo
What nigga, what," but his man is like "Psych, yo"
Can get from one extreme to the next
And my shit always bounce like DM to the X
I can bring it from up here: "Enough is enough!"
Down to: "Aight, I think it's safe to take off the cuffs"
Play with words, blurs and slurs, flip styles
Take his and hers, niggas is cursed, I get wild
So don't make me angry, you won't like me when I'm angry
I met a lot of enemies and they all like to thank me
Catch me when I'm sleepin with one eyed closed
One guy chose to doze, left one guy froze filled with hoes

[ VERSE 2: Ja Rule ]
It ought to be a long time before they touch this here
It's Gotti's consigliere, let's take it there, make a mill a year
Push Bentleys, ice drippin off the jewels daily
Ja the one, what, y'all don't hear me?
Nigga, y'all remember, CMC 95 December
Fine women, illegal tender, such is life
When I feel like I ain't to be held, who can hold me?
Hoes try to console me, rec execs wanna own me
Damn if I die slowly, drugged out, broke and lonely
Like so many who pushed roadie before me
Ja hit em precisely, God just don't make too many like me
Inadvertenly shittin on the top 20
Y'all niggas kill me, talkin like y'all can't be touched
See, by the time y'all realize I be done touched you up
Blazed you up, your whole style chump, nigga, what
Think again if you thought if I thought I give a fuck

[ VERSE 3: Jadakiss & Styles ]
Yo, it's pitiful, everything's political
But I got more rounds now, so all y'all can get a few
You know the shit that we be on, the three on
'Must be the money' like Deion that we see on
Players, you pop shit, I rather pop shells
Twist l's, blow chats with the rap cartels
Nigga, one nation under gutter (aha)
LOX style (yeah) I bring it to your mother
Christ, you get iced if you fuck with my brother
You know who run New York, so bump the undercovers
Yeah, it's a family affair, you find it rare
My niggas stick together and none of us care
We ain't got time for cages, doin ages
Thinkin of my crew holdin my two razors
Lockin in, lockin out, I play the block
Poppin up, poppin out, I like to shout
I get the finest clothes, top of the line guns
Honeys sellin crack, put this pack on your son
It ain't my fault I want a vault full of money
This shit is dead real, I seen a nigga shoot a honey
Now who's to blame when you bleed, ain't no answer
If it ain't a bullet, then I'mma die from cancer
Puff out till my lungs is gone
And nigga, it's a war till the guns is gone

[ VERSE 4: Tragedy Khadafi ]
Yeah... yo
Giuliani showed me to hell's another level
Blessed by Allah, possessed by the devil
Born in this crime I was sworn to do
Slayin you fake thugs that's performin too
I'mma bleed 25 till my dying day
Sprayin a AK till this world decay
If the feds wanna stay, we gon' make them pay
Cursin they whole life till they old and grey
In the name of the Father and the Holy Spirit
Will they murder me in hell, crucify my lyrics?
Only time ever tells and I know that you feel it
All my niggas in the cell, yo, I'm with you in spirit
Nothin nice 'bout a nigga when he doin his bids
Comin home to the next man raisin your kids
To my thugs in the Bridge, hold your head
Cause niggas is gon' feel it till they cold and dead

[ VERSE 5: Mic Geronimo ]
Runnin with five niggas, criminal disguised niggas
The live niggas, pull a mac, what, surprise niggas
Holdin my mic stiletto-like
Invitin these waterhead niggas to get splashed back and take it light
Slided back when we're 16 my mellow my brother
Told me lay it back, aced back and play it mellow
Seein how I'm a young Othello
Don't confuse me with them brothers who lost playin black De Niro
A boss with this, gettin tossed with Cris
The gorgeous shit, we ballin flawlessly
Whatever y'all brothers try, but never to touch me
The god, heated up beyond the frequency
Now it's time to put you niggas under pressure, we form
Here I am, if it's on then it's on
If the world was yours, could you keep it from a nigga like me?
Hold your head, we about to see...

HookYeah
Came to talk to you for a minute
You know
I miss you
But I love you
Ain't nobody done for me what you done for me, Ma
You know
So I'ma do this one here for you

Rest in peace
Your son

It woulda been the greatest thing in the world to see
All the possibilities, you made em real for me
In '73 opened me to life itself
Guard my health and went for delf but needed no one else
Allah himself'll only know the reason you're gone
And forever I'ma feel a little pain and mourn
(Life goes on) Now I'm blessed, so I raise each morn
Still I ask every night you help me face the dawn
Pray alone inside a stone-cold confusion and weep
But only your touch can bring me to peace
I can keep a little something of you with me till I reach the end
Till then, let me ask you again, how you been?

[Chorus]
	This is cause I'm thinkin of you
	My love for you will always be true
	You know I'll never forget you for life
	Think of you forever

Sittin recallin how you caught me, how you broke my fall
Heard you scream off in terrors, heard my name you called
All of the lessons you taught me, how this life is war
How to hold till I be sure that I can go for more
Saw me enduring the pain and goin from poor to fame
But livin with more to gain is makin me more insane
It's a strain, I could tell you, you already know
Still I'ma live to tellin you so
And I'm sure you know the way that you was handlin was passed to me
Askin nobody for nothin, so don't ask for me
Look and see how you raised a little nigga to man
It was all just a part of the plan
Daze back as I gaze back lookin at the fact that you left
Funny how I keep hearin footsteps
I keep a little something of you with me till I reach the end
Till then, let me ask you again, how you been?

[Chorus]

If I could leave you off with somethin, it would have to be this
You know I'm gettin through these obstacles, you will be missed
Left a kiss on the forehead, hold through a touch
Now I leave that in the streets from rollin up in a dutch
Ask the Lord to bless the soul of a child if He may
I can only hope that we unite and see you one day
And playback after playback, it wasn't fair
But still and all I never say that, remember here
You got a place inside a nigga, where you end, I begin
Till then, let me tell you again, how you been?

[Chorus]

	Do you know I'm thinking of you, Mama
	Don't you know I think about you all the time

[Chorus]

I love you, Mommy
Word[Intro: Tyrese] + (Mic G)
Had a moment to myself (back y'all, it's been a struggle)
And I asked (I'm here) why me? (and that's cool, yeah)
All these ups and downs (yeah)
Ooohhhh no no why me?

[Verse One: Mic Geronimo]
A manic depressive, well what could be as bad as this
Where I'm locked in the bathroom, cuttin my wrists
Could it be that I'm tired of my life goin one way
The same-ass struggle from Sunday to Sunday
Damn, I used to keep a hundred grand
And it hurts when my girl sayin she don't understand
And she cry too, sayin baby they denied you
And you got them haters in the game who despise you
Or could it be that I've been livin in a fantasy
Thinkin niggas really cared, sayin they were family?
A bad dream, seein 'em stand around
And they watched me drown, I heard they mock me now
Well fuck 'em! Now that I'm gettin back on my feet
And I'm focused we all gon' sit down to eat
And the streets said Mic man we need you back
The game's a puzzle and son, you a piece of the rap
And I love dat, that's why I'm doin what I'm doin
Y'all and God the only things gettin me through it
And when the rain rains hard, the sun will shine
I'm only here to get mine, seen?

[Chorus: Tyrese] + (Mic G)
No one ever said it would be easy
I know it takes a lot, to get by (yeah, I'm alive)
Even when they ain't makin no room for me
I'm makin room for me, watch me fly (yeah)

[Verse Two: Mic Geronimo]
Now, now - if you could see the pain in my eyes
Shit I flew through the back windshield of my ride
And I damn near died, and uhh
What I've been goin through about three years
It's been enough winter here I couldn't shed no tears
Imagine losin everything you ever owned
From your ice, crib, your whip, your girl and home
And then, you and only you alone, gettin by
And the man in the mirror he ain't nothin but a lie
So you try hard, but you not gettin richer
And you grind hard, but they won't see the picture
So you say now, maybe I should leave the pain
Hurts so bad, there's nothin I could never explain
Then I said to myself, you control everything
That's around you, nigga you the master
Nigga suck it up, get your weight up, avoid your disaster
Longer, stronger, harder, faster

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Mic Geronimo]
Before they speak a word against me, I have no shame
Had to run and pull my chain in the pourin rain
Before they, spread lies they best be raisin some questions
I done, made mistakes I done learned from my lessons
They gon' tell you my temper had me out of control
I was blinded by the pot and wouldn't look at the road
Some'll even say the closest motherfuckers to me got me
By genorosity, prayin that my haters'll stop me
Fuck 'em, I don't care, they gon' walk anyway
Fuck 'em, I don't care, they gon' talk anyway
And I've been through the drama, see this life's a strain
Hope you never see what I did of the hurt and pain
And I walk through this road with a cross to bear
No mistakes I can think of or care to share
Now I'm here, I'm a live mine 'til my death
Kill the game 'til nothing's left, I'm alive

[Chorus] - 2X (w/ ad libs by Tyrese)

[Tyrese]
Everything I do, everywhere I go
They don't wanna see me grow
They don't want me goin all the way
I asked myself, why me?  Why?
Why don't they love me?
They want it gone anyway, why they gotta pull me down?
Everytime I try to come up, wanna pull me down
All the way down
'Til I have nothin left
What did I do to you?  Oh no no
What have I done to set them to?(Intro)

Aight man

Aight?

{*gun being cocked*}
Yo what's poppin nigga?

[Verse One]
Yesh, yeah, yeah
M.I.C., M.I.C
Now, now, now, now
Momma, I just killed a man, shot him to live
I know you can't believe the sentence out the mouth of your kid
I know you shocked and my explanation, it don't explain it
And I can see you cryin and riffin at my arraignment
I tried to handle it cool, you taught me the rules
Told me look up on the floor and find me somethin to use
But things you wouldn't understand momma led to his murder
I know you never ever pictured me with drugs and a burner
Shoulda heard him, he was tellin me 'Nigga you gon' die'
I could see the devil dancin in the white of his eyes
He despised me, shot his heater, then I shot mine
I'd never lie to you momma, I committed a crime
And I'm alive though seein he tried to stop my survival
Forgive me the things around me done turned me to livin trifle
My rivals would love to say they left me dead in the dirt
But I could never have you goin through the pain and the hurt
I just killed a man

[Hook]
Seein it was him or me
The look on his face, I tried to erase, and now
And momma I just killed a man
And I took him out of life to death
With no remorse, I must confess, and now
And momma I just killed a man
Then I left him in a pool of blood
With murder one, I'm still your son, and now
And momma I just killed a man
See I'd rather be tried by 12 than held by 6
I choose to live, and now, now

[Verse Two]
Momma while I'm speakin to you over the phone
I got involved with certain things I know you wouldn't condone
I only did it cause I knew you was destined for somethin better
Than workin them two jobs and fightin to stay together
I never intended to kill him, seen it as God's will
Only thing gettin me through this is knowin Allah's real
I caught him and stepped back, my barrel was still smokin
I said to myself he's goin, watched him started convulsin
My bullets opened his chest up, now I'm just standin there like
Things are messed up, and what could I do?
Before he died he said the wolves I'm with are comin for you
It's ignorance that had him thinkin there was nothin to lose
Now feel me momma, I ain't wanna, I didn't I'd be a goner
They want me to turn informer and tell 'em about the corner
I'm never breathin a word, hopin you understand
Many hats I got to wear, it's bein this man
I just killed a man

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I know you thinkin that it's messed up, seein your only child
Inside the system facin 25-to-life and it's wild
Nothin I can do about it, though I wish that I could
You never wanted me to end up like the rest in the hood
Now feel me momma I done killed but I did it with no intention
A minute free of your guidance it got me with no direction
I question myself, sayin if I wouldn't have shot him
Could I have lived and could we both have just worked through the problem?
But seein things are what they are I just, hold my head
Stick my chest out and walk to where my soul's been led
And what you said, it's just the bed that I made, so I sleep in it
Forgive me I'm up to my knees in it
And momma I just killed a man
