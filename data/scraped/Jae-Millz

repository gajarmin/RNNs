[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I like a long haired, thick red-bone
Open up her legs, then Filet Mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick,now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
But you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohh-oh-ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
(And bitch I'm Mack Maine...)
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie (hah) D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzle... baby
Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world [x5]
Young Mula, baby[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I gotta bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser

Her girlfriend Lisa met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick but expectin' me to eat her?
I gotta bitch named Keisha she a real dick pleaser
I gotta bitch named Keisha she a real dick pleaser

I got a bitch named Keisha, she a real dick pleaser
But shawty from Cuba, still workin' on her visa
Her girlfriend Lisa, met her in Puerto Rico
How she don't suck dick, but expectin' me to eat her
That ho crazy, man you don't wanna meet her
But her homegirl Nita swallow cum by the liter
She look good in boy shorts and a beater
But this other girl Quita way sexier than Nita
I ain't lyin she the, hottest bitch, heater
But I'm a fuckin' freezer, yea, I'mma fuckin' leave her
Yea, I'm a fuckin' eagle, flyer and deeper
Smoke like a Cohiba, your ho give me cerebral
Now get low and touch your toes for my people
And if you ain't fuckin' them, then you ain't fuckin' me either
You think your man hot?, well fuck it, me ether
Heard I got guap, wanna kick it like FIFA
Everyday Christmas, cause I'm smokin' that Reefer
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I am southern land not Kiefer
Y-M-E for Young Money Entertainment
Run dummy finna bang it
You want beef then my money will arrange it
I am not fuckin' finna aim it
But that Nina watch out for me when I'm angry

Sloppy like Joe, you better go get G.I
All my guns knee high, m-o-n-e-y
Thats what I rely on I'm gone
He high, yep I'm three high
Im just schoolin' these fucks like Devry
College institution, finals and confusion
Stop with your excuses, Hip-Hop I am seducin'
Beat ya like producers, eat you like produce
Man I'll fuck your girl till her pussy got no juice
Now she can't produce
So you won't be needin' that baby
Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby

[Interlude: DJ drama]
Alright let me vent for a minute
See the problem I got with the game is
There are no gatekeepers in hip hop
Who is letting these whack niggas in?
I mean can someone please put a combination lock on the door
And stop giving out the code, god damn!
Hey Millz show em how its done

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to catholic school back in the day
Now she strippin' in Sues for a stack a day
But she bring it all to daddy so that's okay
I got bitch named Lola, true dick smoker
Part-time broker late nights she work at Strokers
Her cousin name Mocah got a insane spine
But its crazy cause I fucked em both at the same time
I even gotta bitch in the bay name Jessica
I swear she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa gotta attitude, but her ass meaner
And she remind me of this ho I used to fuck name Sabrina
Ugly little thing from the home of the ravens
I only kept around cause her ass was amazin
Tiffany and Emily my bona fide sluts
When I cum they touch tongues and share that nut
Gotta white chick down in Florida name Sasha
On my momma her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washa
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks for you meet the president
Young Money !

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I know this one honey
I call her track star, cause when we fuck she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plumy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld honey
I paper chase, fuck stand still money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody
I'm from the dirty and I make it rain, damn that's muddy
She just want to be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty butty
What it dizzle, is you or is you ain't my baby

Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection
I said, "Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas"
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all, cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'mma put 'em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, now everything loud
Got a mojo, with a flow-flow
Got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Coolin' in the cut with a bud sipping romo
No love for the po-po's
Gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope, nigga work

[Break: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Euro

The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus

Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K no nina
Word to Martin I'm cold with this homie buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say, "Damn Gina"
Millzy! Money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
I'll kill you for some sneakers
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

[Outro: Jae Millz]
We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shooting till my mother fucking hand fall off
Ya track-stars; the gun shot ran y'all off
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss
Shotguns handguns louder than a band drum
You fucking with the drum major don't make me play you the anthem
Bang bang bang bang call it heavy metal
I say bang bang, bitch I make you feel every letter
B.A.N.G. B.A.N.G. G.A.N.G
We spray then leave
We play when we no
We play N-E-
V-E-R; C.P.R
Doctor Carter are you the d.z's boy
Young Money mother fucker these these boys
Bitch is you crazy?
We's  retards
Watch Nina, Mac and Tommy have a brief menage
Like (gunshots) like (gunshots) yeah
Soulja Boy on the beat
But you can call me Chef Boyardee
Cause I'mma heat this shit
And I'mma eat this shit
Planet earth is my toilet you're beneath this shit
Then I flush and wipe my ass
Gunslinger like a pass
I cock back and throw a bomb; now Hail Mary
Your tailfary fairytale very frail
And yeah we got them hammers try and hit every nail
Let them sail up the river with that ho shit
Or leave them face down in the fucking ocean
I ain't on no other shit bitch I'm on some more shit
That 'Hello how you doing? I am at your front door shit'
That 'Aww naw he got a gun oh shit. Shit.'...shit

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Okay, it's Young Money what you know about it?
The semi-auto will rip open your body and tear the soul out it
And all that fronting shit nigga I don't know about it
Call me Master J, bitch I'm so about it
Even my ho about it, and don't doubt it
Cause we both would be Angelina and Brad'n
Spazzin' and blastlin', blastin' and rattitatin'
And nah I don't cook but like potatoes I'll mash them
I don't give a fuck about your money or your fashion
Shots through the window of your brand new Ashton
You get out try to run now your chest where them bullets crashin'
Pawn box niggas no crutches no casts
No wheel chair just the two door long black wagon
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me fuck boy don't be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist y'all just some Kung-Fu Pandas
Sweet like Fantas, my blood is the same as Bruce Banners
Hit record on the cameras mother fuck all the bullshitting antics
They saying he ain't gotta get a clearance from Wayne, that's a disadvantage
Being broke is a foreign language for me like Spanish
Musically we direct thrillers, call me John Landis

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
It's the 504 slaughter house blood bath
Little nigga stand tall like a giraffe
One man gang animal, cannibal
Eat rappers for dinner my nickname Hannibal
Guns for days I show you what this cannon do
Hit you split your mothafucking man in two
I grab the chopper South Park that’s how I hold the toy
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
I’m in the streets one deep I can hold my own
And shit, it’s only one seat and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I’m on my crazy ass shit
You see the gun poking out like Sheneneh lips
Watch your lips when talking
Cause I be on grave nigga leaking in your coffin
Rest in piss
When I die, let me rest with clips
Rambo, I’mma go out on my Sylvester shit, bang![Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Um, She said can fuck me right, I made her fuck her friend
She say don’t call her a dike, well thats gay
Haha, I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
Cause every time she leave she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit so I made the pussy gleek
Wylin' wit my niggas, and I don’t give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we roundin' them up
I treat her like I need her, Im knowin' if I eat her
She gon' tell Quieta, and Quieta like the media
Woopty woo to the bloods, her lipstick match my flag thats swag
Weezy F Baby got nuts that drag
I put em' in your mouth till you choke and gag

I poke her face off and now she faceless
I poke her so much I deserve a bracelet

Young Money!

I poke her face off and now she faceless
And I just gave “Poker Face” a facelift

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Chi Town girl, bag match her heels
Her ass hella fake, but it feel real
And it felt great when we had sex
I tore her out the frame, with pics of my ex
From my aspect, I love your assets
I love your mini skirt, that's easy access
Pipe game, never mediocre
So that relationship is over, once I poke her
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus
It was all us, on the tour bus
And she did all us, on the tour bus
Like
Hahaha[Intro: Jae Millz]
Ooh girl, you nasty (x4)
Ooh that girl nasty
Ooh girl, you nasty (x2)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
(She a nympho, she a nympho, she a nympho, she a nympho)
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
(Shawty is a nympho, she a nympho, she a nympho, she a nympho)

[Jae Millz]
She's a nymphomaniac, brainiac
Literally the smartest and the taken fact
She like girls so "Every Girl" is her theme song
She jump up on that dick and get her trampoline on
I'm tryna tell her how sexy she look wit cream on
And all she wanna know is why I still got my jeans on
Bounce till the springs gone
Ride ya till you can't continue
Head board of the bead banging like a gang member
And when I gotta headache I don't do the normal nursin
When my skull hurtin yea she my skull surgeon
She don't care if she get her hair or her neck pulled
She can go all night her heart pump red bull

[Hook]
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater

[Tyga]
Wild wild west though
Don't them girl white really give that best dome
Go-go head, suck me dead
Leave that coffin wet, rub this lubra on your chest
Playing with your titti pierced, feeling like a kid again
Let the mammal in, I'm gettin like camal skin
Into her lions den tiger dog in this bitch
RUFF RUFF like clifford no comic shit
She opens it but bite them lips like parana's here
Put your face way down you's a gold digga
Same flippa no city but that ass bigga
Young Money Nigga we don't know none of these nigga's
His girlfriend the only thing I rememeber c-cause

[Hook]

[Mack Maine]
She got stamina, she got endurance
She drives my dick crazy, I need insurance
She got stretch marks, cause she got children
Them bitches like soulja boy they be round the house YOUUUUing
We never fuck in a bed that smell like urine
I'm getting my dick suck, "what are you doiiinng??"
She's a nympho she done fucked all (my kin folk)
She'll fuck you 14 weeks straight
Copy that? 10-4
She fuck like a porn star, be bouncin like a bad chick
Head going up and down like hydrolics in her neck
T-shirts with no panites on, she throw it back with no breaks
And I'm not talking domestic violence but she'll take your wife beater

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I don't know what to tell you
C-can't answer the phone I'm going to have to e-mail you (hell yeah)
Come the she up in my spot
I just beat it around the clock
Wife beater and some sucks

[Hook]

Girl you nasty[Jae Millz]
Millz break the block down from A to Z
I could supply you with work, little nigga -- I'm like a temp agency
I'm in the kitchen, wood chair with the feet broke
Soft white got the table looking like a ski slope
Fuck going out, me and my money elope
And most niggas rap about money but they be broke
My man went to Morehouse and had strong blow
So I had him pitching in Atlanta like John Smoltz
Nigga, money make the world go round
And a stack of it'll make a nigga girl go down, clown
Patron and Grey Goose get the bitch loose
And after the crew, I'll have her licking on her sis, too
We getting money where I'm from, nigga (Harlem!)
We getting tired of your chick, tell her pack her shit -- come and get her
Put her onto some shit, and get her grind right
Get her mind right, fatten the ass and get her spine tight
I'm the flyest
Most niggas want a deal with Nike -- I'm like, dumb nigga, I'm trying to buy it
I need percentages, I don't care who the hottest
Little nigga, I think big like Christopher Wallace
And I won't stop until my grandkids' grandkids sitting on dollars
And I ain't even a father, nigga
Call me Your Majesty
Young, black and fly and when it come to dough I got a Jewish mentality
Little fuck niggas still trying to battle me
I go in their mouth like I'm a dentist looking for cavities
I don't know why your mans hyped you with that battery
I'll hit your whole team with caps, and I don't mean salaries, nigga
Already got dough, now I'm chasing the power
I'm the statue, stand tall cause I'm replacing the Towers
And these niggas washed up now, they faces is sour
Mad cause they broke and lonely and I'm making them dollars
With enough divas to spread out to ten cities
I can throw assists all night like I'm M. Bibby
Harlem got a fucking reason to front now
Uptown, let's go -- we got a reason to stunt now
I told Joey and Stack shit ain't intact
Captains lost our city now we gotta get it back
Nigga, you can take it how you wanna
But ain't nothing impress me for the last three summers
I don't give a fuck how disrespected you may feel
Nigga, see me when you see me
It's whatever, it's Jae Millz, motherfucker

[Stack Bundles]
The crew feel better when real 'round it
Still round it, dress square but a nigga well rounded
Grounded like I came home late on my curfew
And proved I was better than most niggas my first two
Lil' years in the mixtape league
Now it's bidding war time -- I got a Bloomberg league
So the hood's overwhelmed
They know it's the voice of the hustle whenever they hear son up at the helm
Son give 'em hell like Daniel in The Advocate
The fans fiending for it -- they got the addict itch
That's the bundles, put it all in your nose
These niggas is lil' me's, hear it all in their flows
Ho's, that's a topic you don't even wanna touch on
I face-fuck the ones you couldn't touch on
Hand brushed on see the denim, know what these 'bout
The Antik's, Red Monkey's, or Vi's out
Y'all bring the V's out, I can even splurge
GT's wasn't me so I'm leaning towards the Spurs
Leaning towards the furs a lil' more to my nature
Mink, coyote, fox all in the nature
I get it in blocks I'm the Seymour Cake-ster
I give it on the arm, you can get it from me
Cause if prices was any cheaper y'all be sellin' it for free
Paid 2-3 sell it for 2-2-5
McDonald's is making more for profit off Super Size
I spit the truth inside, niggas wrote the fake shit
These niggas practicing snitching, y'all on some jake shit
Millz spoke on it, I agree with him
Can't even spar with niggas, what's the reason for a gym
Ain't hot enough to even work up a sweat
I been fire since Wu days with The Purple Cassette
So when you mention my name these niggas get offended
No chain on, just a five star pendant
General of that Riot so Squadddd Up
Feeling real prestigious hopping out that Porsche truck
I'm on top of my game and still climbing
They're not fucking with him, can't even peel off his hymen

[Joe Budden]
It's the nigga with the mask on that would yack dude for jewels
Ain't gotta say it, that dude the truth
Make me put that tool to use
And these niggas that be in the game shaking like Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
Not Tourrette's, gotta rep my team to the end
Lambos to Ferraris to the Beamers to the Benz
If I blam it'll kill, never ran never will
Only thing that bleed on me is these jeans on my Timbs
Hat low, it's not a weak link in my squad
I'm LL, in too deep, I'm thinking I'm God
Far as rappers, I'm thinking they're frauds
Call 'em all Rubix Cubes cause I really used to think they was hard - ha!
For once trust me, you don't wanna start problems
The pound will make you Eddie Curry with a heart problem
So if you on the block with only a few grams, man
Then you a bird nigga, Toucan Sam
And any beat, I'mma air that, rappers just gotta wear that
Fox Brown should be the only one that can't hear that
Hit you in the spine or the belly, gun on me
I ain't Sticky Fingaz, I ain't leave mine in the telly, smell me?
Thank god he ain't fucking wit that red line
Cause I'll murk any nigga that disrespect mine
If it wasn't Fed time, or lock up or rec time, dude'll be a Daily News headline
You ain't the best, what memo got sent?
If you got dogs, what kennel they in?
So if you wanna get fresh like a Mentos mint
Then it'll tempt those men with clips longer than Leno's chin
There ain't no type guts wit you
You Terrell Owens -- them niggas that wear eagles, they don't even wanna fuck with you
Me, fam? I was pimping weed dirt back when niggas used to rock Simpsons t-shirts
I'll give it to any nigga, I mean any nigga
Big man or skinny nigga, dare a dude tempt me, nigga
Auto or semi, nigga; dump till it's empty, nigga
They don't even want you in New York -- you like Penny, nigga
Check the time -- it's around that hour
Little niggas, they ain't 'round that powder
They ain't super or Luigi or Mario, ain't found that power
Plus they couldn't spit fire if they found that flower
Cowards, know the toys bust loco
While they trying to dap my hand like the Boy's Club logo
And yea that 5 slide and clock
I'm the million dollar baby, but I won't die trying to box
Don't want a piece of the cake, I won't the pie and all
I don't believe 'em when they say that they supplying the raw
You don't move white -- you lying, dog
That's a never-ending story without the white flying dog
Son, these dudes is broke, don't know the feeling of bread
They in debt, tampon niggas, still in the red
And the fans keep asking if ya man stopped beefing
I call 'em Mr. Fantastic, tell 'em, "Stop reaching"

[Killa BH]
Ah-ha, stop reaching!
Killa BH, son!
I'm ready to rock
Yo, ah-ha
When I come through, I'm like...a something
I can't remember
I'm that nice
Like the spice
Ah-ha
I can't even spit right[Intro]

PO10NT
Seven figures

[Verse 1]
I started out with a wish
Turned some work into a whip
Young nigga big money no money clip
And now you can’t tell me shit
Ridin’ dirty in a clean bimmer
Fuck sleep ‘cause I ain’t a dreamer
I put mortgage on a nigga head
Tell his daughter “daddy say the wrong thing he dead”

[Hook] (x2)
Where I’m from we tryin’ to get them seven figures
Snitches pressin’ charges, killas pullin’ triggers
I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Fuck that small money I need seven figures

[Verse 2]
She got a ass that look unreal
That’s probably ‘cause it ain’t real
She got a man but he broke though
He got work but no flow though
My youngin’ hit the trap and do a great job
Lil nigga got it jumpin’ like Nate Rob
Million dollar mentality
I pray my daughter follow after me

[Hook]
‘Cause where I’m from we tryin’ to get them seven figures
Snitches pressin’ charges, killas pullin’ triggers
I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Fuck that small money I need seven figures
Nigga, we tryin’ to get them seven figures
Snitches pressin’ charges, killas pullin’ triggers
I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Fuck that small money I need seven figures

[Verse 3]
Niggas hatin’ but I ain’t worried though
I’m gettin’ money, fuck I need to worry fo’?
Like Styles I’m a gangsta and a gentleman
No time for back and forth, this ain’t Wimbledon
Seven figures, I need them seven figures
Tony Montana [?], me and seven bitches
Seven figures, I’m out here tryin’ to get it
Hustler spirit tryin’ to flip it, nigga

[Hook]
‘Cause I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Snitches pressin’ charges, killas pullin’ triggers
I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Fuck that small money I need seven figures
Nigga, I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Snitches pressin’ charges, killas pullin’ triggers
I’m tryin’ to get them seven figures
Fuck that small money I need seven figures

[Outro]
Nigga

Tryin’ to get them seven figures
Where I’m from we tryin’ to get them seven figures
Nigga[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
I'm the real, I'm the authentic, the fact and the truth
It's Jae Millz, brown skin, but I'm black in the booth
And for the green or that white, you'll see red
Mushroom bullets hit your body then they spread
Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his momma to get him some nice threads
So at least he'll be a bitch ass nigaa dyin' in style
He didn't want to look up to me now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell em on these beats I'm a beast
Half man half animal like king on Tekken
I'll wreck him, hell ya Young Money is what I'm reppin'
Respect em' or I'll put you on that highway to heaven
Matter of fact pussy you'll get your own lane
With no speed limits so you can get there in a minute
It's Dedication 3, there's no replacin' we
That's like askin' a group of Muslims where that bacon be
Straight Grand Patron flow, there is no chasin' me
And that amnesia is what my medication be
That's that Amsterdam grade A,  I'm smokin' in the Netherlands
So high that I'll probably fuckin' never land
Bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Muthafuckin' psychopath
Young Money cave men, muthafuck a Geico add
Fo' Fo' bulldog, fuck around and bite yo ass
Shittin' on you bitches now let me flush the toilet and wipe my ass
Bitch I'm ballin' I like my cash, no I'm lying I love my dough
Got them hoes fallin' like a hundred million dominoes
But I don't eat pizza, I eat pussy when he wouldn't
Holla at ya guala, yeah bitch it's me
Kickin' muthafuckas out the kitchen heat
I'll put you where the fishes sleep
And when they wake, you'll be the fishies feast
Yeah, I'm a shark you see my fin ho
Bullet leave a hole in ya face, not a dimple
Straight from the N.O., it's no problemo
To put a nigga brains on the muthafuckin' window
Ugh, damn right I'm nasty
How I come through in that white eyed Aston
The leather guts and might I add in
It's black on chrome like Darren McFadden
Yeah, and don't be comparin my swag with
These wack-ass niggas thats o-so-swagless
Yeah, and call me Mr. Swag-more
Gotcha girlfriend open like some fuckin' pores
Or open like some fuckin doors, nigga it's fuck you and I'm fucking yours
From the bedroom to the floors...whores[Verse 1: Euro]
I'm that Dominican nigga, your bitch be talkin' 'bout
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I got a whole collection of my ho collection
Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection
I said, "Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas"
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all, cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'mma put 'em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, now everything loud
Got a mojo, with a flow-flow
Got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Coolin' in the cut with a bud sipping romo
No love for the po-po's
Gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope, nigga work

[Break: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Euro
What up this Mack the fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my nigga
Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K no nina
Word to Martin I'm cold with this homie buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say, "Damn Gina"
Millzy! Money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
I'll kill you for some sneakers
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'
Nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA
Little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dog
My team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you
Special I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin' your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

[Outro: Jae Millz]
We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Believe dat.. it's DJ Khaled
It's that We The Best, YMCMB
"We The Best Forever"

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
A million lights and a kick drum - the floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling bout this one - and we still young you know-oww-oww
I'm breathing fire in your club-ubb
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold

[Tyga]
Uhh, new Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
Twenty hour flight never jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day til the night pass
Damn, I ain't trying to fight that
But if we fall too fast will the feeling last
{*singing*} Now I'm looking over my shoulder, shoulder, uh
Champagne, good dimes and good times and now it's all over
{*rapping*} But you can't blame me for all that
You was bright now your heart all black
Try to outshine the good with the bad
You a cold motherfucker I ain't mad at you
Still shining

[Hook]

[Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Mai-I-I-I-I-I-I-ine...
You getting old and your heart turn cold
Time-line froze; mad at the world
Cause you lived your life but this the life that we chose
Lights on the road for the nicest Rolls
I mean long-ass flights for these trifling hoes
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled
I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live your life
Lame-ass nigga, you cook it with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo Lion the king, I'm looking for a dope queen
A First Lady baby, Young Money's Barack
Baggy cargos, high mismatched socks
Me, Gunz, Millz, Tyga, we give em the chills
Weak riders, get birth control pills

[Jae Millz]
(Millzy...) Uhh, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right
I'mma sip champagne till it blurs my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front like Jeter
My diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of cheetahs Jesus
Loud jewelry, loud speakers
Blowing loud weed with some loud divas, Millz

[Hook]

[Cory Gunz]
(Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, Khaled)
Uh, it's that summertime money time
Gonna rhyme good time, wanna dime, gimme mine
Loud smoke, quiet engine out the city line
Pretty toes hanging out the window to the finish line
Spikes poking out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best fall in line
Uptown thorough breded from the South Bronx
Hot blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothing like a movie: I just day-to-day this
Remember it was hard trying to pay us wages
Nice spitting hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told em major later
We some independent niggas getting major paper
Shout Tune, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep, so how we gon' give up that
YMCMB, lights, camera, ACTION~!

[Hook][Hook: Detail]
Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that chick was thick, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name
Maybe if I get her attention she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm making my move, you know what I mean
It ought be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
His chid gotta heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bedroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
GTV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at weather yet, so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, "Man, we got next"
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

[Verse 6: Birdman]
Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

[Hook][Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shooting till my mother fucking hand fall off
Ya track-stars; the gun shot ran y'all off
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off
I can kill y'all and y'all boss
Shotguns handguns louder than a band drum
You fucking with the drum major don't make me play you the anthem
Bang bang bang bang call it heavy metal
I say bang bang, bitch I make you feel every letter
B.A.N.G. B.A.N.G. G.A.N.G
We spray then leave
We play when we no
We play N-E-
V-E-R; C.P.R
Doctor Carter are you the d.z's boy
Young Money mother fucker these these boys
Bitch is you crazy?
We's  retards
Watch Nina, Mac and Tommy have a brief menage
Like (gunshots) like (gunshots) yeah
Soulja Boy on the beat
But you can call me Chef Boyardee
Cause I'mma heat this shit
And I'mma eat this shit
Planet earth is my toilet you're beneath this shit
Then I flush and wipe my ass
Gunslinger like a pass
I cock back and throw a bomb; now Hail Mary
Your tailfary fairytale very frail
And yeah we got them hammers try and hit every nail
Let them sail up the river with that ho shit
Or leave them face down in the fucking ocean
I ain't on no other shit bitch I'm on some more shit
That 'Hello how you doing? I am at your front door shit'
That 'Aww naw he got a gun oh shit. Shit.'...shit

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Okay, it's Young Money what you know about it?
The semi-auto will rip open your body and tear the soul out it
And all that fronting shit nigga I don't know about it
Call me Master J, bitch I'm so about it
Even my ho about it, and don't doubt it
Cause we both would be Angelina and Brad'n
Spazzin' and blastlin', blastin' and rattitatin'
And nah I don't cook but like potatoes I'll mash them
I don't give a fuck about your money or your fashion
Shots through the window of your brand new Ashton
You get out try to run now your chest where them bullets crashin'
Pawn box niggas no crutches no casts
No wheel chair just the two door long black wagon
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me fuck boy don't be outlandish
We gorillas in the mist y'all just some Kung-Fu Pandas
Sweet like Fantas, my blood is the same as Bruce Banners
Hit record on the cameras mother fuck all the bullshitting antics
They saying he ain't gotta get a clearance from Wayne, that's a disadvantage
Being broke is a foreign language for me like Spanish
Musically we direct thrillers, call me John Landis

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
It's the 504 slaughter house blood bath
Little nigga stand tall like a giraffe
One man gang animal, cannibal
Eat rappers for dinner my nickname Hannibal
Guns for days I show you what this cannon do
Hit you split your mothafucking man in two
I grab the chopper South Park that’s how I hold the toy
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
I’m in the streets one deep I can hold my own
And shit, it’s only one seat and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I’m on my crazy ass shit
You see the gun poking out like Sheneneh lips
Watch your lips when talking
Cause I be on grave nigga leaking in your coffin
Rest in piss
When I die, let me rest with clips
Rambo, I’mma go out on my Sylvester shit, bang![Verse 1: Jae Millz]

Big bottle of something
No matter what it is
All I know is I'm gone handle my fucking bizz
Baby you gone get the fucking bizz
Not a porn star but I was made for the fucking bizz
And baby girl fuck the rumours, I'm just tryna fuck the rumour
Sheets hanging off the bed, pillows on the floor
Nights stands knocked over, pictures falling off the wall
Bedroom bully, I'mma beat the pussy up like it did something to me
Before you could even get out them denims
I'm behind you with your cheeks separated cause I'm in them
Grown man shit, red berry and cran shit
Ass in the air while I serve you this grown man dick
Grown man dick, I got that make you forget about your man dick
And all of it you can get

[Hook]

I start at night but I end in sunlight
Girl I promise this gone be the fucking best dick you had in your life
This gone be the best dick you had in your life
I'mma gibe you the best dick you had in your life
And when you wake up in the morning you gone say
This was the best dick in your life

[Verse 2]

It's on you but no matter what it is
All I know is I'mma handle my fucking bizz
A filthy mind state is what Jae stay in
Got you love juice spraying from the PM to the AM
On the red aisle from Cali
LAX I'm delayed in
And you're blowing up my iPhone cause you hate waiting
80's baby so you know I'm on that dope shit
Call me the dope man, serve your ass that dope dick
Yeah, I got that dope dick
Make you wanna smoke it
Screaming out this dick is the best
I'm like "No shit"
I'm reckless but I get the job done well
And we can do it anywhere 1-12
You on your way to work
I snatch you while you getting ready
Back shots, side shots, missionary
Reverse cowgirl, up and down girl
I'm back and fourth like a Leo when I pound girl
Millz

[Hook]

I start at night but I end in sunlight
Girl I promise this gone be the fucking best dick you had in your life
This gone be the best dick you had in your life (YMCMB)

Pair of jeans on neva seen on canal, baby girl I do my thang
I swing it back, bring it back, like a boomerang
It's click clack and kick back when the rooger bang
My chick in pepper, Gucci slipper stepper
Philly spot baggin buddie out wagon
Broad name Jadera, hard to get near her
She can make a "careera", shakin Like Shakira
Arch in her Back Bone, like throwin back trone
Even if she take it there, she gone bring it back home

[Hook x2: Jae Millz]

So you won't be needin' that baby
Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby

[Interlude: DJ drama]
Alright let me vent for a minute
See the problem I got with the game is
There are no gatekeepers in hip hop
Who is letting these whack niggas in?
I mean can someone please put a combination lock on the door
And stop giving out the code, god damn!
Hey Millz show em how its done

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to catholic school back in the day
Now she strippin' in Sues for a stack a day
But she bring it all to daddy so that's okay
I got bitch named Lola, true dick smoker
Part-time broker late nights she work at Strokers
Her cousin name Mocah got a insane spine
But its crazy cause I fucked em both at the same time
I even gotta bitch in the bay name Jessica
I swear she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa gotta attitude, but her ass meaner
And she remind me of this ho I used to fuck name Sabrina
Ugly little thing from the home of the ravens
I only kept around cause her ass was amazin
Tiffany and Emily my bona fide sluts
When I cum they touch tongues and share that nut
Gotta white chick down in Florida name Sasha
On my momma her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washa
September nigga, so you know he nasty
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
Now I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks for you meet the president
Young Money !

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I know this one honey
I call her track star, cause when we fuck she run from me
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb bummy
And I don't get girls, I make her get one for me
My weed real plumy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld honey
I paper chase, fuck stand still money
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody

She just want to be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty butty
What it dizzle, is you or is you ain't my baby
Baby?Fu fu fu fu find me in the nice spot
Watch me get this b*tch jumping like hopscotch
Bow is the name but dont get it twisted
Always wear a rubber when im in these dirty b**ches
They better stop playing with me, They better stop it doe
Rooms full of cash, would think I sold a lot of doe (Stuntin)
Ka-keep hoes like a pint do, killing every stadium and every F**king Venue
I run this sh*t, hit these other rappers up like Funyun Chips
Big Dog no kibbles and bits
And when I say I ball, I ain't talking about dribbling b*tch
Park my Yacht next to diddy boat
I put on for my city yo, if you ain't planning on making it rain
Then why the fuck you in here foe?
Smoke erb until my lungs collapse
Im just a young nigga with big stacks
They Call me Whizzle B*tch

[Hook]

Cuz I Felt Like It. That's why
Hey Bronson. I wish you would have called me when you had this one
This is one joint I'm mad I missed. Ya'll killed this but whatever...

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Rugby is getup. Shit, you know threads
I wrote this while I was on the shitter. Rappin' in my head
My nigga told me never give up. Hid me from Feds
I told him, "I got you my nigga. I'mma get this bread"
Lazy niggas ain't tryna get to the scratch
They praying for a lighter load, I'm praying for a stronger back
Know I'mma hold it down
Started it from the half a O and flipped it into some pounds
Old head like it's quiet on the streets
Copped work and then sniffed off of the cross like Priest
He like it's like what weed is for me
I'm like to each my nigga, I'mma stick to these trees
Kushed God give a brief sermon
Three Kings in a cones, nigga keep burnin'
Old school like hotboxin' in the Pathfind
Marijuana totin' 'til I'm flatline
Hello

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Salute to Kushed God, this my type o' talk
I smoke long blunts 'cuz life is short
Thinkin' of a master plan that I am
Praying I ain't gotta revert to O's or back to grams
All my niggas solid, I ain't worried
So if they get snitched up, I ain't scared
Pigs tryna wrap niggas, killas tryna clack niggas
Then you got these hoodrat bitches tryna trap niggas
I smoke loud then I get quiet
Thinkin' bout the nearest bank vault, what's inside it
His block got him gassed up, thinkin' he got it
I turn his future pitch black, make his vision guided
I'm a true Harlem nigga, you'll never see stocks
Bucket on Tilt, cool milk with the T-top
I told my mother wherever I go, I needs pot
So when I die, bury me in the weed spot[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I like a long haired, thick red-bone
Open up her legs, then Filet Mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick,now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
But you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
But anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohh-oh-ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? we drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
(And bitch I'm Mack Maine...)
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good

For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all

I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are

Jae Millz
Mister officer, mister officer
I’m sorry I don’t wanna take a walk with ya
Matter of fact, I ain’t try'na talk to ya
We ain’t got no business, so what we talking for?
There ain’t no need to bring me in for no interrogation
Cause about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving
At the precinct writing statements on which trap house is the station {DAMN}
Not I, tattle-telling is for homos
Besides, thats the Number 1 Young Money no-no
Police, we don’t chat with them
We ain’t got no rap for them
You in the cop car pointing niggas out from the back of them {THERE HE GO}
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I’m black, then you's a fucking goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the halfway house and ask your supervisor

Chorus

Nicki Minaj
Yo… 4, 3, 2

Chorus

Gudda Gudda
Young Money psycho, straitjacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn to informant

So I’mma bring you to the bottom of the ocean [uh chuuch]
I hear you preaching like a fucking reverend
Should've killed you in the first place, no second guessing
Could've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect em
I could AK attack em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
Cause I’m God’s gift like a present
For one don’t try me I could give you two lessons
You peasants get murdered if you do test 'em
Gudda Gudda biatch!

ChorusIf not us then who

Okay, they say time is money and most say life is short

I’m in the air first class
Pound key, can't talk sorry
Look in my eyes and you gonna see its a real nigga
No deck of cards nigga

It was a man's world then and its a man's world now
If you a fake nigga before then you a fake nigga now
Nothing change, same song
Same lyrics, same sound
Same shit different day
New problems every day
That revolver got that bang
That automaty just spray
Fuck games I don't play
Unless it's NBA 2k
Or that Madden

Russel Westbrook

Gotta watch my back, these niggas hating on a young nigga
Stand up nigga; i will never run nigga
God as my witness, ima be the one nigga
Shock the world, and let em watch my kingdom come nigga
10 killers can't amount to this one nigga

Momma told em kill em with my music slowly
The game over, and ima cross over like Kobe
Now get it nigga!

[Bridge 1: Birdman]
Yea, Number 1 in that field nigga

Just know it's real out there, so be real out there
Stacks on top of stacks
Bitches, whips, floss, gettin in puttin it in nigga

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Swerve on a hater like, "fuck your life"
Just out of spite, if that's your girl then I'ma fuck her twice
We ain't from here, if you ain't known better tuck your ice
I'll put a brick on your head, consider that your price
If its about money, you can count me in
I'll turn 50 to 100 before you can count to 10
End up missing fuckin with Millz, never found again
Rappers thinks they nice
Congrats, they must have found my pen
Shit is real I take it to the heart now

You boys goldfish, swimming with the sharks now
Fuck what you drive, just know you will get parked now
Millzy in this bitch, and now i'm on the top now

What I rap I live it, What I make I flip it
Money stand tall as Roy Hibbert hater forget it

[Bridge 2: Birdman]
Yea, where I from nigga even killas get killed

Ball baby ball, you understand me?
From 100 to 1000 nigga yea from a mill to these mills man

[Verse 3: Flow]
Okay, them birds fly high but we get them bitches cheap
Table full of coke who say two mountains never meet
Glock 23 and a chopper with a stock lift
Bandanna tied around my head on my Pac shit
Watch em run and yell bitch nigga tuck your tail
Click-Clack (BAH! BAH!) throw the Glock in the canal
You know young'n keep it real so you gotta respect him
All my niggas kill for me they so overprotective
And what's up with these rappers I ain't feeling these niggas
Had a talk with Birdman he told me "kill these lil bitches"
Man they can't fuck wit me
I hope they second guess
Nigga you ain't raw
Like dope that's re compressed
I'll kick in your fuckin door everybody in your house die

Rich Gang bitch but I do this for the have-nots

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Uh, man fuck these niggas

Fuck twitter nigga in real life nobody follows ya
Ya momma should've swallowed ya

Young Mack my driver but i'm Captain Phillips niggas

You gassed i'm a hybrid
Uh, i get cougars in my granddaddy shirt
And get my weed off my family tree that's granddaddy purp
You get found under the earth or in the trunk by the bazooka
I'm on the side of the road just like a state trooper
I run up in your castle, steal your princess King Koopa
Better have some weed in that bitch if you pass me that hookah
I need the cover of the Forbes before i leave my corpse
Streets say that i'm abusive, I always whip the Porsche
You ain't in the streets you just jumped off the porch
You's a sidewalk nigga
For that side talk nigga
I'll barbecue your ribs when the fire spark nigga
And tonight i'm in the six i left the five parked nigga

Bitch I ball hard
Sugar-Slim my sports agent
Young Paul George

Niggas online be like " FUCK YOU! " I be like ditto
I'm coolin puffing good with lil izo at the cribbo
Hungry Hungry Hippo

With Mack in the building pimps retire or get fired
It's Young Money the Rise of a fucking Empire
I'm Gone

[Outro Birdman]

If everybody befriend me still got the man up above
If you move in them pitchets, get your chick in there dog
Cause the gov taking pictures when you out in the club
Better believe it
My ex told me grow up
The she told me I changed, I said I ain't who I was
She TB'in my cup, redbonin my ride
And I've been ready to fly since ready to die

[Hook:]
Straight from the bottom, straight to the top where I'm goin
I could still be in motion when my car roof open
Lord, yo yo
God bless the child
I've been killin for a while and ya'll bless my style
Amen
God bless the child
She ain't have a lot of school but God bless the now
God bless the child
God bless the child
God bless the child

[Verse 2:]
I know where I'm from so I know where I'm going
I'm a uptown nigga, all my jewelry is golden
All my homeys are solid, all my women exotic
All my relatives seated, I chose rap over college
I curved NYU, went straight to the lead
Fuck orientation, I got paper to see
I got places to be, I got people to meet
Never wanted to be like Mike, wanted to be RP
That's Rich Porter
I'm so Harlem, so Harlem
Way gone and weight money, no problem, no problem
I do this for the G's, lot starving for a pardon
Cause it get cold in them jail cells when them lights darken
Better believe it
We ain't getting no younger
Got a kid my nig, gotta eliminate hunger
Gotta stay on this money, I gotta stay sucka free
Both palms together, Lord bless me please

[Hook:]
Straight from the bottom, straight to the top where I'm goin
I could still be in motion when my car roof open
Lord, yo yo
God bless the child
I've been killin for a while and ya'll bless my style
Amen
God bless the child
She ain't have a lot of school but God bless the now
God bless the child
God bless the child
God bless the child

Young Money! L'eggo!
Sittin on the toilet, smokin on some medicated
Countin' loose thousands, I'm living good, they agravated
Two things on my mind, one is to keep styling
And the second is to get more of this shit that I'm countin'
Call me J20, I flow like a fountain
And I swear I beat the beat up till that bitch start ouching
Keep them bitches' asses bouncin', man we fly like a falcon
Comparing them to us is like a pebble to a mountain
Im a uptown flamethrower young money fire starter
Had to sign to Wayne, I'm from the same place as "Tha Carter" Ha-Harlem
And I ain't like none of these other niggas
I get it, I spend it, your husband on a budget, Mrs
Young Money cloud gang so above you niggas
Besides these groupies after the shows, who's fuckin with us?
You might as well have a badge, the way you cuff them bitches
I slut them bitches, then back to the door, I fuck them bitches

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Times ain't the same, shit been going bad
But nigga we good, nigga we gooder than the motherfucker
Than the motherfucker, this for my motherfucker
We run this motherfuckers
So fuck them niggas and fuck them hoes
Money talks, we say hello
And I'm so, I'm so
I'm so Young Moolah baby

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Ok it's too much paper and not enough hands to count it
Paper coming in money never going outward
Its young money yeah I hear a lot of niggas doubting
This here is god's work, ain't nothing you can do about it
So nigga join the team or you can catch the sideline
And just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We making money while you niggas makin petty quotes
You can make it rain, we make it flood like the levee broke
It's all about the paper, money control my whereabouts
About a year from now I'm trying to break that new McLaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip, Vanna White in it
Bitch shotgun, probably be your wife in it
Hustle year round nothing come in front of that
Rap real estate and work, I can make a ton with that
Pay me in advance so I'm not coming bitch
Like Pain, Wayne and Mack Maine, I got money bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Young Money I'm the boss, you don't wanna come across
Money do summer salts, Bentley on young adults
Stuntin on them hoes, it ain't me, its the money folk
Still make it rain, get struck by a money bolt
What it is though, I know what it ain't
Yall go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stubs, bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up and running, join the campaign

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Times ain't the same, shit been going bad
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, as anybody was
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug
And a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch
I got that dope dick, there ain't a bitch I can't addict
And I'm looking at the game, I roll my eyes
I-I looked at the clock and her hands were tied

[Hook]
