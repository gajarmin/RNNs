[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy right
And I approach baby like: "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, you's a baby, right
I told her I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me, come stay the night"
She looked at me laughing; like "boy, your game is tight"
I'm laughin' back like, sure you're right, get in the car
And don't touch nothin', sit in the car
Let's discuss somethin', either we lovin' or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speeding up the West Side
Hand creepin up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like "Cam, stop fronting on that Dave Hollister tip
Come over let's swallow and sip." I'm like: "momma is sick
I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks
(Why?) They all say I'm rotten and rich"
But not her, boobies' real, high heel dooby feel
Plus got them Gucci nails
You a cutie still
And this my down girl too - ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the jacuzzi, I tell you, my boo be's real
I mean she do be winnin', Louis spinnin'
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen
I see boo be grinnin'
She looked and said: "Cam, I know that you be sinnin"
"Naw! I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
(Look) I got a whole new game plan"
Looked and said: "That's nothing but game, Cam"
She was right, she was up in the Range, man
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right, I had to call up L

[Cam'ron & Juelz Santana]
Yo L (what up?) I hit (what else)
Plus dome (say word) and we got it on tonight

Andretti-O Pirelli make a movie out the getty
Where my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Rose and chronic smelly while stumbling out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, way my pencil move his deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl outta' lezzie
Magazine, mac, benzie keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button than I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking
Meter go 200 something and my trunk do when it's bumping
I am not the one for jumping I will rachet out and stump him
Dump him, your better off dead, ya money red

[Bridge: Juelz Santana/Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high
Got your bitch waving at me when I roll by

I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz, or Bentley, I be movin', I be movin'

Pockets fat, necks studded, boy my nick name should be Ruben
My Columbian connect told me the Mexicans have moved it
And he know just how I get it so we bout to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar called her that cause she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boostin', got a white girl that be boofin'
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she stupid
And she always ready to give me that becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July
But if you get to frontin and the pushing lead to shoving
We just bussing and we leaving like it's nothing
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be bagging bitches for me

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Lloyd Banks]

The realest high is being high alone, you know
The realest high is being high alone, you know
Born alone and die alone
Realest high is being high alone

[Verse 1: Belly]
Take a second, you should take a second
You already took one, trynna take a second
You over there waiting, they over there hating
You fly to L.A., that's Californication
Borderline obsession, keep possessed by possession
Every girl look like sunday, girl that body's a blessing
Go to church every thursday, pop that pussy on monday
XO shit bitch we running, put these drugs in your stomach
Like down to hatch, down to hatch
She's just down to match, now she found a pack
I swear ride alone, no ride alone
You know I love to fuck with you
But...

[Pre-Hook: Belly]
The realest high is being high alone, you know
The realest high is being high alone, you know
Born alone and die alone
Realest high is being high alone

[Hook: Belly]
That's why she wanna take the pain away, she do
Drugs, pills, that too
Alcohol, that too
Trying to numb her body, cause love kills
Love kills, love kill, love
And she want it in the worst way
High heels, she take it all
She just wants your money, cause love kills
Love kill, love kill, love kill, love kill

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Love K-I-double-L-S
But we rather die having sex
So I just killed that pussy
And she just fucked me to death
We be licking and sucking, we be tripping and bugging
We be sleeping and fucking, we be drinking and drugging
Between this dick and these drugs
She might OD all this D in her stomach
But then again why we fucking
It's like she [?] out the mouth while I'm pumping
Hold op she cumming, I just keep pumping, I get it in
Just stick in the toungue and bring the pussy back to life
Just to go kill it again
Treat that pussy like soil, I'm looking for oil
There I go drilling again
This dick got her addicted, she keep trynna kick it
But there she start itching again
There she go twitching again, she need that fixing again
She know I'm with again, I'm 'bout to get again

[Hook: Belly]

[Outro: Belly]
The realest high is being high alone, you know
The realest high is being high alone, you know
Born alone and die alone
Realest high is being high alone[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yess
What it look like Alc
Tryin' to show the niggas man
It's that Street Fam man, we rep that
Loso
Street fi-di-di-di-dam yes
I'm with 101 niggas, we dalmatian doggy deep (yess)
And fly with the tongue
So if you feeling froggy leap (come on)
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song, before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They trying to tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop top, they say it's Ocean Drive inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Uhh, I get money like a muhfucker
Shades darker than a bitch, but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Oww I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeeaah, money you ain't never see
Yeeaah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I'm on the grind 'til the police come
With that pistol on my side boy, don't be dumb
Or, I let that semi twirl you
Now you can follow the drip
Cause one shot outta the clip'll jerry curl ya
Leave you sloppy like seconds
Obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents, please
My young boys wildin' for respect
Slit your throat have you smiling with your neck, say cheese
My dough's a bit longer, my flow is just slaughter
My wrist look like frozen Poland Spring water
So tell me boys, tell me boys, who you think you messin' with
I get money out the ass, that's some expensive shit
Haven't you all heard
Y'all all herbs
I stick toothpicks in y'all hors d'oeuvres
I'm a shark y'all just koi fish
Octopus, oysters
Chump, I got my eye on your wifey now
I have her lick me up and then wipe me down
She told me you's a nag, you's a bug
She told me I'm a blast, I'm a stud
She told me you be beastin', you be checkin' for the burns
So I gave her knee pads for the rug
It's skull gang from the chain to the lifestyle
You surfboard dudes get wiped out, totally

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Get you 3, forget you
Like the number after 1, I'mma get me 2
It's Weezy F U, now you gotta have a baby
My money don't folds nor bends, Mercedes
Maybach, grey-black
And I got a 44. and a 'K, like 8 stacks
Fuck your city and your town, I state facts
Take that, no better yet like Diddy, take that
Wait rats, I hate rats, I clean 'em out like Ajax
Got paper like a fax machine, asaneen
Damn I mean asinine, I'm dapper don
And after mine there will be nine, damn I mean there will be none
I will be one, of the greatest things you've ever felt, you've ever seen
Or heard, Car-ter, hov-er, y'all scared, not me
Not I, call me Young Popeye
Tell Bluto I'm a nuno, I bring RAL to your funeral
Damn I mean fun-er-ill, fun-er-ol
You say tomato, I say tomahto
You say get 'em, I say got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Man you better keep payin' me
Cause you don't want my problems
I be wildin' like Capital One
What is in your wallet
You fly, but what is it to pilot
Weezy I'm at the top, foot up in your bottom
Huh, damn I mean, foot up in your ass
I kick that shit
Now go'n put it in the trash

One shot of that'll have the boys bring the coppers out
And we balling, foreign toys is what we hopping out

[Snoop Dogg]
They call the D-O-Dub, wasn't really tripping cause
Twenty-one, twenty Crips and all of us is cripping cuz
We from a different street all got that different heat
But when we move the Macs for Game we on the same beat
So if you fuck with Blood then you fuck with us
And we ain't busting duds cause we busting slugs
We sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside

[Nas]
Game got at me about the remix, it's an honor my nigga

Talking bout how they gon' spray and take me away
But I'm the true living legend
I'm not to be questioned
Have your whole hood holler shit about my progression

[T.I.]
You knowing my attitude shitty only a buck fifty

Chopping holes in all the walls that's all they saw

[The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead it just took a couple shots
I bring it back to life give it a couple shocks
The King's coming no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie dog, no not Waist Deep
I'm not an actor but I'll show your bitch big meat
She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week

[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
Till them niggas lying still up in stiff cases
Within styrofoam and embalming fluid
I been gone too long and I'm down to lose it
Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box

Yeah I'm chopper-happy and my wrist loose
Call me Goldie I'll smack your bitch too

[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier
Banging underwater fuck around and soak you

Ain't nothing sweet unless it's Presidential
That is where I sleep now give me my key

[N.O.R.E.]
New York get the blood money, dirty cash still sweet
We with Black Wall Street by the swapmeet with heat
Def Jam they gonna flop him and Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more
It's ok I get it popping
Back to the forest trees for deep, these little me's
Who took believers an opportunity to breathe
And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick

[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in, Blood out
Me and homie back to back
Both loaded working we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hip-Hop dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah no security, I'll put you on the respirator
I'm the bomb I'm the motherfucking detonator
One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood

[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up

[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two
Let's go you're eyeing us in the iron bus, boom

So what you boys gon do to me, I'm born street
Your life's sweet, MTV's Laguna Beach
Mama told me not to play with fire but
She never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs but I'm in the thangs
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame
The boss made it yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller
Keep white in the office call it Jerry Heller
Letting off a hundred rounds let the barrel pick
And we gon sit here and wait for the derelicts

[Twista]
Bitch Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at

[Daz]

Glock holding on the hip rolling with two clips
Got two tiny locos ready to take trips
Shake and make trips high stakes to take grips
But they know what's cracking cuz cause as we huddle
They hold cards down nigga like spades and pinochle
West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz

[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride

[WC]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood

[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies

[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood

[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???

[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up

With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah[Hook: Future]
Walking downtown with a fat booty freak
You get a ring, so they don't visit your door
20 G's on me
Designer from my head to the floor

40 grand for the sky dweller
4 grand on the Margiela's
44, I'm a pawn fella
Bad bitch 40 times
Wake up in the morning, brush my teeth, smoke
My baby kissed my baby's daddy, gotta go
Semi-automatic, ready for the show
Clique full of killers, that's my band, we all rock and roll
Drum roll for these niggas please
We shopping for bodies, killing sprees
We be in the club spending rent
We be buying cars that these niggas rent
Couldn't see me if I had no tint
Superman that ho Clark Kent
You choke, don't do [?], I'm always on some new shit
[?] tracking my movi


[Hook]


[Verse 4: French Montana]
It's friday, it's friday
2 million dollars in the driveway
I need more money ASAP Rocky
Streetsweeper, get the floor moppin'
I done started with a bank roll
Whipping salt harder than tank door
Smoking killer, I am with a killer
Pull up to the dealer looking like a dealer
In the droptop strapped, worth [?]
Now he off the wall, million coffee pack
I've seen dreams turned to 25 to life
Mike had 25 a night
And them shoes Alejandro
Shawtie bust it open for a hundo


[Hook][Verse 1 - Jim Jones]
Ayo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tune with
The moon and the stars
Some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught - pissy clubs
Saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star - nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds
Run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge - Cam'ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, ayo
Go get that yayo, yayo
Killa, paper, holla at Pedro
On the 8-0 and wait for my son, the lay low
Ba' bro

[Cam'ron]
When I beef, names will be said, tool will be spread
Two in your head, body be bagged, eulogy read
Dog in the news will get read
Cause what I deal with is usually feds
On the first

[Hook]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
It's the first of the month
Yayo yayo! Yayo yayo!
It's the first of the month

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now I'm the type of dude
Post up, sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties: You want it? I got it
You see it, you like it
We count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a "menace to the public society"
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it, I'm driving, I'm puffing, high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving
I'm bugging, my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc, it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers
For all their milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
You niggas follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me and still a little nigga?
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done
Steak and chicken for the fridge
And their kids fly.. I ain't open, friend
On the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes
Barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam for some coke again

[Jim Jones]
Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image
It's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people
Why? Because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
No one on the corner has swagger like this
Cause I'm so incredible they not compatible to me
Eat 'em up like I was cannibal, the cattle to a beast
Graduated from the hunger now it's rappers that I feast
And I'm coming for each and everyone of you that said I couldn't do
Now I'm swergity swagging on you bums doin' this interview
Call it an interlude, talking to you inner fools
Got nominated, I know they hate it, they sick of dude
But if you sick of new, I feed the lamers Theraflu
Get em man and buy a coupe and drop the roof
Adjust the cruise, show them what the swagger do
It's on the highest altitude
They can't fit my sneaker shoes, the best rapper attitude
See the younging in the zone
The beaches, see the features on my faces I can't erase because my swagger so amazing homles
Catch me at the top
I'm throwing Big J and hot metal
Balling like I'm Karl Malone
The next best is on!

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
There's only two men I fear when it comes to a battle:
God and my shadow
Everybody else get a ravelled, tangled, mangled, totally disabled
Hung from a roof watch 'em dangle
Then I make his wife feel the pain too: anal
Juelz Santana, forget those busters
The boy flows harder than Kimbo's punches
You boys betta step aside, before I get at guys
You just bugs I'm spittin' that pesticide
Your not mobsters, wait stop the fake, or get found dead with your head in that pasta plate
Money in the bank I benefit from my benefits
I'm making it while I'm spending it
You go to the Louie store, you go to the Gucci store
You go to the mall spend it all what you do that for
You could buy the rags, you could buy the bags
But there ain't no sign that say they sell swag
But you could watch me and do your best imitation
You need a little time, a little preparation
But sooner or later your gonna have to face it
I like a pent house, your a fixed up basement
As far a chicks go I get it you take it
I give 'em all Franks, they call me Nathan's

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Lyrically it don't matter, up-and-comer or a has be
I'm in your ass B who’s the next Raz-B
Wordplay king I'm not the one to Scrabble with
The rocks got more carats in it than rabbit shit
And after these ill lines, you might see why I need a deal sign
Cause everybody coming in this year is failing
Ask why and they just play Sarah Palin
I'd rather be in Maui para sailing
Cause when you in the lead you don't care who’s trailing
So get your little money you isn’t a threat
When we was making it rain you wasn’t drizzling yet
Right Meech? Death before dishonor
Their swaggers like mine cause I left it on the corner
So fly I gotta shop at the Sky mall
And this summer we getting more drops than eyeballs
Loso!

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I told you this once Hip Hop is not dead
Change gon' come, just like Barack said
"Money, Power, Respect" like The Lox said
"You'll be the man of the house", my paps said
Heat the streets up, right quick it's all timing
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
You could know so much yet but no nothing
If I don't know nothing else, bet I know hustling
This ain't even a rhyme, it's a controlled substance
Strictly iron swinging, no tussling
I just do business I don't do friends
Brand new M1's and 9mm's
As long as money's involved with it I'm in
You ain't gotta second guess the best, I'm him
I would rap circles around these new urkels
Everything is digital, pills are still purple
So I'm staying in my lane 'til it opens up
I'm like a sponge in the game just soaking up
Before I'm gone I deserve a hit
I know you heard of Kiss
This is the cypher, I murdered it![Cam'Ron]
Uh, Uh Yeah
We back in the fucking building
Diplomats, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Santana, Freaky
Came in second half
Shit man, only thing we really wanna know right now is
What? Is what's really good? That's the question

[Cam'Ron]
Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence (But what?)
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga
Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow (Nope)
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow, and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out ASAP
Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a ice white
I'm real ice right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is
(DMX) What's Really Good?
(Cam) Nothing, see me on 55th, black scooped it up
A-k activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
(DMX) What's really good?
(Cam) I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese (What's Really Good?)

[Hook: Cam'Ron] + (DMX)
To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos, hello
Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know (What's really good?)
All my niggas, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggas wanna know (What's really good?)

[Jim Jones]
Okay I admit
I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
44 lead when I'm spitting
Shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'
They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them
So please tell me y'all
(DMX) What's really good?
(J.Jones) Top of the drop when it's missing
MY block when it's clickin', these rocks when they glistening
(DMX) What's really good?
(J.Jones) 145th on this crunk, big 45th in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them
Squally, so through your set up please
And let me know if you really good
And let me know if you really hood

[Hook]

[Cam'Ron]
I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind me of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her
Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me the end I see prophecy
(DMX) What's Really Good?
I'm in the buggy mon', with the Rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out "Fuck me, uh?"
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

[Juelz Santana]
It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth when I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty
I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit, and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh
You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
(Dmx) What's Really Good
(Santana) ME MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this
Santana, bandana, release the eight a spit (COME ON...)

[Hook][Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Half of milli all in the bag, if this was Philly they would say I'm in my bag (Meek wharrup?)
Quarter milli with the paper tag
And I keep the nine milli playing laser tag
Condo in Miami that's my favorite pad
Watching Rondo vs Miami he just made a pass
Gotta coupe it when we racing past
Body stupid with a crazy ass (hey baby)
High heels, red bottoms
And I miss my nigga Zoe for real cause the feds gottem
You doing 30 pray for 65 percent
And the car dirty bitch you know I'm riding bent

[Hook]
Kingpin, 848, lights camera action, first 48
Fly bitches, meet me at the bar
And when they catch us we gonna get the biggest charge
Kingpin 848, sex money murder, first 48
Live niggas buy the biggest cars
And when they catch us we gonna get the biggest charge

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Still slanging cocaine boy, still gang bangin' with my gang boys
Swagged up, still rocking big chains boy
Who wanna hear that chopper make noise?
I'm smoking dope, straight out the gas mask
It's big b's nine tray billy bad ass
I'm selling coke whats the quote, I match that
Matter fact, I got them for half that
How many mug shots they gonna taking me
Before they understand they ain't gonna pin a case on me
Kush stay rolled up, pocket full of fast money shirt say slowbucks

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
I pulled up, hopped out, through the deuces
Love that smell and that these haters blowing kush
I got muscle with my hood call me flocka bush
Get your head knocked off for a couple bands
And hear the ... my youngest, let them ... around
Told them keep shooting no stopping unless you're gun jam
We got automatic big guns like call of duty
Keep it ... that's my call of duty
Fly young niggas rob you in some louie
When upon my bus got burned now he trying to sue me
Free my brother gucci, and my nigga boosie
I swear to god my life is like a fucking movie

[Hook][Chickens clucking in background]

All the chickens go cluck, cluck, cluck [repeats throughout song]
When I come through
All the chickens go cluck, cluck, cluck
When I drive through
All the chickens go cluck, when I
All the chickens go cluck, when I
All the chickens go cluck, when I, yo, yo

[Cam'ron]
I'm that one cat that the hood be lovin
They way I floss, y'all chickens, should be cluckin
One bird chirp, got blunt wit me
She work up at Starbuck, front on me
I said chill baby girl, you a real dirty chick
Fucked up bad, real, real, thirsty chick
You just chop, called you karate chick
Fuck with me, I make you somebody bitch
Like your sister, she was just a crack chick
Now heads turn, yo, yo who dat bitch?
Like Cam is a son of a bitch
That'll tell a girl, ma, wash under your tits
But I, got a girl, we all call her "Licka"
Cuz she drink liquor, let another girl lick her
If you licky, licky, we all could play
But I don't eat nothing that can walk away, Killa

[Chickens clucking]

When I come through...
When I drive through...
Uh, one mo', when my jewelry shine...
All the chickens go, all the chickens go, all the chickens go...

[Juelz]
Now if you been to the hood, you dealt wit a chicken before
And you know that they different than whores
Same rules, never put your dick in 'em raw
But a chicken you could have out, pitchin 'em raw
Cuz she listen, been through it, did it before
But you gotta watch 'em close cuz they blab they mouth
Never punch 'em in they face just slap they mouth
Then fuck her til she cluck her whole basket out
Send her home wit her ass ripped out, and her back hurtin'
She wanna act like she don't know why her back hurtin'
Cab fare no, hope your train pass workin'
Hope you got a metro card or a token
They all love sayin if you lickin you stickin
But just cuz I eat chicken don't mean I eat chickens
And they love when I don't stop, keep diggin
Make 'em wanna cluck more, make 'em wanna fuck more

[Chickens still clucking]

Uh, uh, Killa, uh, uh, what, uh
When I come through...
Oh, uh, what, uh, when I drive through...
Uh, uh, uh, when my jewels shine...
All the chickens, all the chickens, all the chickens

[Cam'ron]
Ayo one time came through, grabbed me a chicken
Took L advice, slap me a chicken
But my girl don't need no type of brains
Just get down, gimme some type of brains
And I'm never gonna have no damn wife to claim
But if your head right I might ice your chain

[Juelz]
It's a shame how y'all chicks admire the jewels
Niggas wearin white gold y'all inspired them fools
But I'mma tell you chicks once
Only thing you gon' get from Juelz is dick and some big blunts
And if you don't smoke guess it's just dick
But don't worry baby it's about this thick

[Chickens continue]

Uh, when I come through...
Yo, it's like you know, if my watch is $50,000...
My chain is $45,000...

Now this has been one hell of a year
This has been one hell of a ride, I'm tellin' you guys
They'd thought we'd never survive, Jekyll and Hyde
Or the great american pie, weapons collide
Dead or alive, left with no choice but to um, better our lives
Get up and strive, but um, get up and roll, get up ya know
Get up and go, these motherfuckers ain't lettin' us go
So we get up and take it, get up and make it happen for us
Nobody can get up and take this
In rapping we trust, gat packin's a must
It's part of my nature, part of my wake up
Part of my waist yup, pardon my waist chump
For this part of my waist chump, come part of your face, yup
It's Santana, part of the great stuff
But really man, pardon I'm great chump

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
She wanna roll with me she wanna go with me
But she don't know I'm tryna take her back home with me
I told her have a seat in my ride
She said I look like I taste good and she wanna eat me alive
She looking good in them new tall heels
I'm looking at her like a full course meal
Chill, I got all the girls checking me
They know I'm a dog but they love my pedigree
Yeah, just call me Mr. Orgasm
And if you come with me I guaranteed you gonna have one
The hottest in the hood, the freshest on the block
Why stop all this Gucci and the Louis that I rock?
If not, I stay Polo down to the socks
Rings, chains, and watch worth more than Fort Knocks
Temporary plates on the Audi R8
Diamonds match what I'm wearing she can't stop staring

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Runway walk, beauty queen face
Video body see the curves and the shape
And everything her mama gave her she know how to shake
Thicker than a milkshake and I'm tryna get a taste
Hair did, manicure, pedicure
Attitude like Vivica, when she played in Set It Off
She feeling my swag, she feeling my G
Not only is she dancing she feeling on me
And I'm feeling you too, so I put my hands on her
Just to let her know the feelings mutual
No mama we could birthday text
Yes I said text but I know you know what I really meant
Tell me what you will do, tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you don't know how to do so I could show you
I'll give it to you give it to you like I owe you
And after I'm done I'm a tell you I told you, so

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
You should, know me, I could see myself in your future
That's hood, O.G., I made up my mind I'm choosing ya
Don't say, you won't try to lean in, I'm feining yeah
My heart is waiting on us, girl meet me at the valet
Lamborghini Breezy, I'm a transform ya, name you Mrs. Breezy
Stunting so hard but I make it look easy
Let's do it like we do it when we doing it for TV
Yeah

[Hook][Intro: excerpt from the movie "Scarface"]
“You all a bunch of fucking assholes
You know why? You don’t have the guts to be who you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fucking fingers and say
"That's the bad guy"
So, what that make you? Good? You’re not good
You just know how to hide, how to lie
Me, I don’t have that problem”

[Hook One: Juelz Santana]
Uh, say hello to the bad guys
Feds taking pictures, HOPE THEY GOT MY GOOD SIDE
The price of life is getting cheaper

Beamer, Benz, or Bentley; Kima's friends with Wendy
And both of these bitches want my penis, evidently
My jeans are never empty -- it seems, coincidentally
They say that time is money, so my team be spending centuries
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- life's full of decisions
If hating was a crime, you would do life up in a prison
The spiteful competition knows that they wouldn't have a shot at eating
Even if they had a rifle in they kitchen
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- Banks, 'elz, or Loso
We be paper touching -- bank teller flows, ho
Yeah, we smoke a lot of kush, drink hella rose Mo'
Y'all got a disease called "Can't tell the ho's no"
Beamer, Benz, or Bentley -- we black all of 'em
And we hold heat like a motherfucking oven
My homies, I love em: it's family over everything
And fuck anything that ever try to get above em[Verse 1: Avian]
I need a pretty raw chick like Rihanna
Touch a bitch for the first time like Madonna
Strap it on the bass like Gaga
You didn't have it, girl, but I'mma put it on you

I want a ménage with Nicki
Be a slave with Britney
Make Alicia hear that slow long up here

[Chorus: Avian]
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
I need a billboard bitch
And I'mma make you famous
Put that platinum pussy on it
And I'mma make you famous

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I need a billboard bitch
Man, I had a few of those hoes
Guess what? I'm still bored, bitch
You still a broad bitch
I hit it from the back, I tell her sing my chorus
Yes, I put on that side not, yes sire
And I quote, she ride the beat then ride today
Oh, shit, she hit that high note
That billboard chick's on the block where I sell keys
I done named names, check the credits on my LVs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
With a ratchet or a billboard bitch
They all just want this real good dick
I'm bait, I reel them in like fish
Big pimp, oh, she taste like shrimp
All I do is hit, I never miss
Fucked her so good she left a Tip
Front, back, side, I hit all spots
But like the billboard, I love her on top

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Britney or Estelle, hit me on my cell
I don't discriminate, I put that dick up in the jail
Catch me with Keyshia, I tell you how I sex her
In my drop top Ferrari, call it mustard back ketchup
And tell Rihanna I will call her off a nanny
Fuck her from the back while she holding all the Grammies
With Nicki a ménage, if it's me, her and [?]
Or catch me daydreaming about JLo and her body

[Verse 5: Avian]
Oh, you about to be a star
Coming for you quick, girl
You're top ten or better
Oh, make you known around the world
I know you're a sexy girl
Let's take it to another level

Birds flying high you know how I feel
Birds (birds) flying high, you know how I feel
Birds flying high, you know how I feel

And I'm high to the tip top...and I'm twisted with a slip knot
Tangled in the grip-lock
And will I ever stop? never that light it up bring it back
Bring a ounce not a sack
I got it foggy as a suana in the building
Looking for ur boy, im probably crawling on the ceiling
Fallin on the railing catch me im gone
Im in another zone but trust me im home
Where the blunts be thicker than the arm
Every time I cop a roller, me say, "This one is the bomb"

She said band's make her dance, I'm beating drums and blowing horns

She tried to lock that pussy up, but I came through like bail bonds
White seat (yeah), white mink (yeah), white car, I'm the black Fonz (Fonz)
Www.I-fucked-the-shit-out-of-her.com

We stomp that nigga out, and watch him drag out that pussy

[Lil Wayne]
She don't even know me like that, uh
But she gon' learn today, yeah
And every big dog like cat, girl

Great minds think alike, and then I paint her white
So I can

Told her to come downstairs, we did it all in my Caddy'
Asked her where them kids is at, she said upstairs with they daddy (WHOOO)
Money coming in by the packs, everyday I pop tags
In the club wasting this cash; bitch, keep bouncing that ass
She said real niggas don't last, they say real niggas don't last
Nah, it's just too many fake niggas making real niggas look bad
Get lost with your lame ass, livin' fast - no brake pads

I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me

[Lil Wayne]
I feel like a black Republican
Tote the MAC in the public and
Act so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been done had cake day late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the end. I
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

Red beam on that black nine
Cold steel with these hot shells, you talk shit and I back mine

Can't even relax in my room

We the best! Look at what we drive
Got pic-nic tables on my lap, gettin' high
In the back of the Maybach, and it cost five
Hundred thou on a nigga, spent that with a smile
Stackin' numbers at alarmin' rates
White house, still move brick of ron in a day
I'm that Bin Laden boy, I'll bomb ya state
I ain't come to stay, I got a postbar and a date
Two leaving in a bag, ain't one to brag
You don't know the feelin' when the villain peelin' in a Jag
Just starin' at the ceilin', ten woman at your pad
I was at the center, now I see villain just in fact, I'm a Boss

[Pre-Hook 3: Lil Wayne]
Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money
It feels good to be Young Money, Cash Money
Rehab, I'm addicted to fast money
I got stacks of rubber bands up in that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Practice makes perfect, I'm relaxing at rehearsal
I'm a mothafuckin' professional, like Herschel
Walker, the talk of the game, is I
But I wonder will they still be talkin' after I die
But that's not important, money's more important
Understand I been in that water like I was snorklin'
Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin
Miami, Khaled took me in like an orphan
Why did they start him, now they can't park him
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent
Lamborghini dark tint, philly blunt cigar scent
I'm by myself cause niggas running mouths like auctions
T-Street's my brother, FeFe's my brother
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter
Ya heard what I say, mothafucka did I stutter
With my brown paper bag here to represent the hustle, I'm out

[Pre-Hook 4: Fat Joe]
Coka baby, man you know I already had money
Definition of that brown paper bag money
Try front and I'll zip you in a bag, money
For the cash, I'll blast anybody, that

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
Ya'll niggas want coca music
Lacostra Nostra flow, show ya how to do this
Pin it so easy, a caveman could do it
Nigga, we simply the best, don't confuse it
I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet, don't give me the same rating
I'm waiting top of Rap Rushmore
Etched in stone, right side Pun's noy
Unsure, anythings possible
4 mill spent, bought out the Art Basel
I'm Picasso, in a Versace suit
Don't worry my nigga, Khaled I got you
Not just cause I want to, cause I got to
Put the squad on your back, the impossible
It's only logical to spit it from the heart

[Hook][Intro]
No more lying friends
[Wayne ad lib] Fuck 'em
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go
X2
[Wayne ad lib] You can't doubt what I got, and if you do you can't go where I go
I'ma go by myself, I come in by myself, so I guess it's all about me and it's fuck you


[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Come on home biscuit,for man's sake
No more fake hugs and handshakes
Stand straight, you sweeter than a pancake
Me, I'm trying to get that green like the landscape
As for my team, originate
See what I gotta say can't wait
I demand cake
Gotta eat, keep the family straight
They all holding out they hands and plates
Yeah, Wayne's from a place called Hollygrove from the bottom of the globe
Area code 5-0-4
Be hero Joe and I zero in with the Eagle and there'll be no him
I don't need no help, I don't need no homie
I don't need nobody - nigga, I got money
Nigga, I got heart to go along with the guns
Call me Weezy F. Baby, I be by myself when I cum, yeah

[Hook: DJ Keyz]
I don't need 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't trust 'em
So mothafucka I was born by myself with my dick in my hand
With my mind on a million dollar plan
Now baby, you are looking at the million dollar man
And I'ma die alone, so alone I stand

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Dudes that never spoke to me now wanna speak [beat it]
Girls that never said a word now wanna creep [beat it]
Guys that never ran with me now wanna be [what?]
The only passenger in my coupe with two seats
Damn, what is it Holmes? Ya boy's breath soft
Air fake, I can feel the silicone
You're all a bunch of Pamela Andersons
Me, a family man, I take care of the family, man [ya dig?]
And it seems like my day one niggas ain't acting like day one niggas
I ain't changed, I just came up, niggas
And trust me when I say I ain't put the streets down or them things up, nigga
Bring the Phantom through the hood, I ain't fronting on y'all
Just tryna let you know it's bigger than the corner, my dog
I ain't playing basketball, but I'm ballin' for sure
Now back to the money, catch me when I come off tour [fuck 'em]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
The rims may offend you on the shit I slide into
Fuck you, send ya to the desert, tell ya be cool
Ahem, hold on the pistols
Roll by the cops and turn up the stereo
Sittin' at the corner, lookin' like a owner
Talkin' to the owner, yeah my price goin' up
All in the strip club, never get a boner
Only get hard for dough, I'm Homer
And you're a Simpson, and I'm a pimp, son
And she ain't comin' to the crib 'til her friend come
We gettin' money over here, you need to get some
Out comes the cold steel for my income

[Verse 4: Juelz Santana]
Out comes the cold steel for my victims
Born alone, die alone, but you could die with them
Cars white and sexy like Nicole Kidman
Bad chick by my side, video vixen
Ya might fly to L.A. just to shop at Kitson
Thousand dollar hoodies, I'm pickin' up about fifteen
That's about fifteen thousand, I'm trickin'
Zero on bitches [Zero]
Swarovski crystals, Great China Wall
And my money run longer than the Great China Wall
And my pockets is Mediterranean Sea deep
So keep plotting and praying to get me [come on]

[Hook]
