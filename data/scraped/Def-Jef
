[Intro: Shaq]
Yo Jef, why don't you give me a hoopa beat or something
Something I can go to the park to
Yeah, there you go, allright, I like that, I like that
It sound dope

(Bust 'em in the eye Shaq)

[Verse 1: Shaq]
You wanna fight? come fight me
I'll hit ya with the "wa-psh-psh-psh", see, see
I get dirty after dark, I'll treat you like Spielberg
You'll get your ass kicked in in a park
You don't believe me, the proof is in the pudding
Been a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding
I flip scrpits with the mad pa-style, freeze
Music please
I dribble rhymes like Basketball-ems
People call me E.T.,
(what's that Shaq man?)
Extra-Tallems
You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up liar!
I lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired
Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck
(hey yo, why you bug a hooker like that?)
Yo, she breathed down my neck!
People walk around like, Yo, they got charged!
But I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7" ain't large!
I kick rhymes like moduck-kwong do
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic
Like Cheech and Chong do
You don't like Shaq, frankly I don't give a damn
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 2: Def Jef]

Suprise, look who's back
Not a prize from a Cracker Jack
Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack
Flexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom-bap
Pass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back
Everybody said I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet
Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad
Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex
You know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex
The way I see, if I was wack like you I'd be at me
The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity
Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, my title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard
Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape didn't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nuthin
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand
Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 3:]

[Def Jef]
Ah yeah, yall don't know nothing about this
The Shaq Man and The Arsenal
What's up like that?
Double XL in the nine-ohs kid
Skills to make mills.
Big up, Flava Unit, Funky Town pros, upstate, yeah ??? ya large
So check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all
The brothers and sister know.....

[Shaq]
Nah, nah, let me continue
I'm a be like Pete Rock and see what's next on the menu
Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka
Rocks from here to Mecca
Boom shack-a-lak-a-lak-a.
I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle
Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel
My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks
The brand new like Heavy
Built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?)
I can hold my own
Knick-knack shaq-attack, give a dog a bone
Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend
Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, "Baby, baby, baby!"
"Every once, every twice, three times a lady."
Is what I listend to, riding with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Outro: Shaq]
I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech
Ron Mac, and my other cousin Ron
This is another rough shot from the arsenal
And you know what? Booty rappers, stay booty
Ha-ha-ha, and we out

Ahhh ha ha ha ha
Ahhhhh ha ha ha ha
Ahhhh...psyche!Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go

[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my Glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Hook]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[ X4 ]

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling wolf tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a ho and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millimeter
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

Song:   Do It Baby

Verse 1

I do work and I'm workin' it with the will of a warrior
I'll take on 54 of ya, nah, I'll even take more of ya
Competition is great, and keeps me in shape
And it's mentally stimulatin'
Competitors constantly contemplatin' challenge
Champion's written all on my face
And I'm smirkin', and lurkin' back in the back
Attacking and hacking and jacking
Smacking up losers that's lacking
Characteristics of poets, they blow it
Tryna show it, yo if I'm flowin' they know it, so it
Compels me to step and release the rhymes that I kept
In case of an urgent emergency then these words'd be weapons
Any discrepancy heard'll have to be handled in haste
At any pace when I step in the place, cos I came to do work

Verse 2

Lyrically thorough, I'm from the borough of Manhattan
And when I moved to the Bronx, then I got into rappin'
Funky beats would control me
It's like the mic would say hold me
I do a solo, me only
I'd be alone but not lonely, cos
Eric would back me
The only track would be doubles
And when the rappers attacked me
They'd end up buried in rubble, cos
We never took losses, opposing forces proceeded
But they retreated, receded, beat it defeated
We did repeat it as needed
Kept 'em seated and some felt cheated
Gave 'em all second tries and still I superseded
I'm a souped superior subsidiary of soul
I keep the crowd in control, cos I do work

Verse 3

I got a need and it's bleedin'
Inside of me to say words
Cos it's my choice and I'm voicin'
Just what I think should be heard
To a sleazy easy goin'
Lazy laid back track
The pace is slow, the bass is low
And yo, I'm ready to go
Do my job, I'm obligated, devoted and dedicated
And loaded and motivated to show that I know the way that it's
Supposed to be done, that's why I chose to become
Professional in this profession, droppin' rhymes on drums
It's automatic that static comes automatically to me
I've had it for longest been at it
So call it fad, it doesn't
Sweat me or get me uncivilized like a savage
I play it civil and give all I got to keep up the image of
Rap cos I happen to be a rapper and poet
Not just rappin' to be rappin' in case you didn't know it
Here's the deal, cos I feel
You oughta be up on what's new
With the rhyme it's time for me to do work
Cos I got work to doArtist: Salt-N-Pepa, Def Jef, Left Eye, Paul Rodriguez, Jerky Boys
Album: The Songs of 'West Side Story'
Song: Gee, Officer Krupke

[Excuse me, Mister Officer, you think we're bad, huh?
You wanna clean up the streets, huh?
Well you better put society in handcuffs
Ha-ha! You got a hard job!]

Music by Bernstein, lyrics by Sondheim
I'm talking 'bout 'West Side Story', it's before my time
Police sweat me like the Sharks and the Jets
Because I do what I does so they wanna get me
If you let me, I'll explain the game
Clear my name and show you ain't a damn thing changed
So don't criticise the way that I parlay
This ain't Broadway, we learned it the hard way

Dear, kindly Sgt. Krupke you gotta understand
It's just our bringing up-key that gets us out of hand
Our mothers all are junkies, our fathers all are drunks
Golly-moses, naturally we're punks
Gee, Officer Krupke we're very upset
We never had the love that every child ought to get
We ain't no delinquents, we're misunderstood
Deep down inside us there is good (there is good)
There is good, there is good, there is untapped good
Look inside, the worst of us is good

You see Officer Krupke, you gotta have some compassion
You know you're always harrassing me
But what you don't understand is I come from a broken home
My mama don't care about me, my daddy don't care about me
And you're always gettin' on my case
It ain't me, homeboy, it's society

Dear, kindly Judge, Your Honor, my parents treat me rough
With all their marijuana they won't give me a puff!
They didn't wanna have me but somehow I was had
Leapin' lizards, that's why I'm so bad
Right, Officer Krupke, you're really a square
This boy don't need a judge he needs an analyst here
It's just a neurosys that oughta be curbed
He's psychologically disturbed (he's disturbed)
We're disturbed, we're disturbed, we're the most disturbed
We're psychologically disturbed

We're out of our minds, you know what I'm sayin?
Yeah, because we got problems deep down inside
I ain't got no analyst to go to
And sit down on the couch to find out why I'm disturbed
I know why I'm disturbed, and you know what?
I don't care cuz it's just like that
And that's just how it is, you know what I'm sayin'?
That's the way it is: crazy!

My father is a bastard, my mom's an S.O.B
My grandpa's always plastered, my grandma pushes tea
My sister wears a mustache, my brother wears a dress
Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess
Officer Krupke, you're really a slob
This boy don't need a doctor just a good honest job
Society played him a terrible trick
Socialogically he's sick (we are sick)
We are sick, we are sick, we are sick, sick, sick
Like we're socialogically sick

[In other words, this is what happens when cousins marry
We are panero heads, in-bred
Hey, we're like Chicano Forest Gump]

Kindly social worker, they say go earn a buck
Like be a soda jerker which means like be a schmuck
It's not I'm anti-social, I'm only anti-work
Gloriaski, now that's why I'm a jerk
Officer Krupke, you done it again
This boy don't need a job he needs a year in the pen
It ain't just a question of misunderstood
Deep, down inside he ain't no damn good
We're no good, we're no good, we're no earthly good
Like a pest, a bug ain't no damn good

The trouble is he's crazy, the trouble is he drinks
The problem is he's lazy, the trouble is he stinks
The trouble is he's growin', the trouble is he's grown
Krupke, we've got troubles of our own
Gee, Officer Krupke, we're down on our knees
Cuz no one wants a fella with a social disease
Gee, Officer Krupke, what are we to do?
Gee, Officer Krupke, krup you![Daz talkin]
Man, I need a hit
Yea, what's goin on over here
You know my nigga got the fat ass motherfuckin bags
Yo, 'sup!
What you got
Yea, you know, comin to buy you out
I know you got that fire

[Daz]
We hit the liquor sto'
Grab some Satin, limonade, cool-aid and fuck the fo'-0
Blaze the indo
Me and E-White and Snoop Dogg in the fo'-do' caddy
With that sticky icky shit, nigga blaze a fatty
My people know me when I touch down the soul
I have it, bring it up my nigga
Puff the bud and bag it
Lace my filas, adjust my tamps and grab my heaters
Khakis and wife-beaters and blaze the fuckin weed up
Yea, you know we did that
Git back and say I did that
Is that the bomb shizzat
That put me on my bizzack
Purple orange the flavour of the month in a blunt
Whatever you need, I got what you want
I got dat

[Uncle Reo Chorus]
(fire, I'm on fire)
Ooooh I'm on fire
(fire, fire)
And I don't wanna be pulled out
(fire, I'm on fire)
I wanna keep on burnin
(fire, fire)
Forever I'm on fire

[E-White]
Something so hot it leave me sweat
Bairly breathin soakin wet
Don't expect me to be close up on it unless you let me
I bet cha it is better for us both to let me close
Is you 'bout it, keep private shit that jump off in the closet
Baby what you want, I hope Daz got a blunt
I hope Snoop will let me swoop in Snoop DeVille so I can stunt
Straight fire baby
Take it back to the wire maybe
I can find what I was lookin fo'
A wide open hooka ho'
Mad dog cuz I'm lookin on
Cuz it ain't no bitch in me
Picture any nigga disrespectin when he mention me
This could be the start of something good so let's make it happen
Get back to the hood
The whole time me and my niggas smoke that

[Uncle Reo Chorus]
(fire, I'm on fire)
Ooooh baby you set my soul on fire
(fire, fire)
With the thing that you do to me
(fire, fire)
I wanna let you know
(fire, fire)
That I'm on, I'm on fire

[Snoop Dogg]
Im electrifyin, dramatisin, recognizin, victimisin
Fratinizin, scandalizin, realizin, tantilizin
Analizin, sexasizin, vandalizin, enterprisin
Maximizin all this shit
Runnin my game and I call that bitch
Put her in a stable
See if shes able
Sit her at the table
Yea shes able
Will she do it, she got to do it
I run these hoes like Clark Gable
Raid these labels
Enable myself to turn the tables to increase my wealth
Move stealth was the tech on the shelf
Try to keep to myself
I don't bother nobody
Usually when I fall in a party
Shit I become the life of the party
And everybody wanna smoke with the big dog with the big dope
Its doggy dizzle and he wizzle
And my lil kin fizzle
Daz Dilly is so silly
Still he will he blaze another philly
Stick it together and blow your mind
Probably so like Donahoe
But I ain't tryin to find a ho
And if I'm rhymin too fast, thats cuz you movin too slow
You don't know, you won't know
Just hit some of this for the mental *chock sound*
Uhhmmm now let that shit go
Now, you know, we know, he know, she know
That boss D-O-G original weed smokin
It's always

[Uncle Reo Chorus]
(fire, I'm on fire)
On fire
(fire, fire)
And I don't never ever wanna be put down
(fire, I'm on fire)
Are you high
(fire, fire)
Whoa, never ever wanna ever be pulled down
Baby, you just don't know that you  got my soul on fire
I don't ever be pulled outAs I wake up in the mornin, I jump up out a my bed
Freedom is on my mind as I place this six by nine cell
Nigga ain't seen daylight, they got me caged like, I'm runnin wild
Just for tryna' feed myself, since they act like we ain't even here
So I say, I've done no wrong, I wanna go home now
Ain't tryna listen to that
The niggas I used to call, they ain't pickin up the phone now
Niggas know I'm trippin for that
I miss my mama, brotha, sistas, man, I'm feelin so alone now
Wish that I could go back
I guess I'm payin the dues of a real true soldier

(Chorus)
It's so hard on the street so I packs my heat
That's the life of a thug, any beef I keep
I'm suited up to kill, all my enemies
If you don't shoot I will, you ain't no friend of me
Now that I'm livin in a cell, the tables are turned
I never knew I had such a lesson to learn
I'm shackled up from my hands to my shoes
I'm so caught up I don't know what to do

I got a letter in the mail from my girl, she let me know
That I'm too thuggish for her world, so she need to let me go
Plus her mama playa hatin sayin datin me is dangerous
She don't think she should hang with thugs
She probably better off though
Run in back and tell the broad she can go, give my mama all my clothes
The keys to my low-low to my brother
Bitch, if niggas tell me you in my shit you will be fucked up
This shit ain't right
Lawyer say that ?? we got that bitch tonight
He say she down to ride, with young niggas like me
Two strikes and I violated my probation
Plus they say they get me if they ever saw my face again
So I, be spendin more time, as a Thug on the Line
Did the crime so I'm doin the time

(Chorus)

Tomorrow mornin, I'm scheduled for the court room
Voices in my head sayin, "Nigga, what you gon' do?"
No soon, I be ridin that big blue bus
Chained up with the killas and the thugs
Tossed all night in my bunk, waitin for the judge to send me up
I knew just what it was when I got cuffed
That that would be the last time I would see the sun
First I picture myself in jail, that vision wack
Then I picture myself rollin my Cadillac
Bounce, bounce, side to side, hittin switches
Pullin off on them bitches, just tryna' get it
But then I flash back cause my cell door slam
Now I got to go see the man, damn
Now we bailin down the hallway
Niggas yellin, "keep it real," nigga always, always

(Chorus)(Def Jef)
Somebody leave me by the name I'm able
I drop more niggas than a record label
You couldn't see me if your TV had cable
I got more juice than an orange and in a minute
I'm a have it made skill trade, going through crews
Like a phase I hit harder than the news about a death in family
I keep kickin my shit as long as my niggas understand me
Smash ya Grammy watch em try to ban me
Like they ran me outta town nigga
You can't stop that sound from the underground
Let me educate you when you hear it you learn
In other words I'll impregnate you with my lyrical sperm
So no matter how far you go away you'll have a piece of me with you, look
I drop more jewels than the clumsy I'm off the hook
I've never been took or taken bring home the loot
Forget the bacon you need to change your shampoo
Cause you be flakin one two watcha wanna do
If you sneeze before you hit the boom
I'll tell your god budda bless you
You don't know nuttin about this hear me out
The way you wear me out I swear I might as well be an outfit
Of course I doubt if you can house it
I sit and see what you come out wit
Just like I thought, you ain't about shit
You gettin over with tracks them rhymes is wack
When you hear me mention R&B, you know I mean "Real Black"
Instead of rap, you catchin flack
Ain't sayin jack I stay in tack cause that (?)
Run not deaf at budda sack and the congac
X a contract show me cash no check
Forget your A&R man and your record exec
Tryin a flex, if I punched you in the ear you couldn't hear a hit
They call me Def Jef cause I ain't even tryin ta hear that shit
I seen a rappers career plummet and learn from it
Money had it but couldn't hold it he ain't really want it
I got covered betta than a jim hat shit
Give me the mic and a gym mat cause I'm about to flip

(Voodu)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
When I walk the night, looking for something to sacrifice
My presence is more feared than the Anti-Christ
My mental transitions cut like incisions
My intellect's deeper than moon ditches
I break a nigga down to his blood type device
Sliced leaving trails of broken mics
So what the fuck you wanna do
When I begin to construct indestructible
Brands of verbal bombardments, I'm the sergeant
When my army of words deploy reminds me of the ?law?
Bianca murders destroy all in my lane
Fom the snows of the Ukraine to the sands of Spain
I crumple competition crushin they're outta commission
My shit be switching like sex positions
No target missin like James Earl Ray
Booth and Oswald I assassinate blastin
(?) your eye across the walls (?) stalled keep it all in your way
Shootin ya down niggas be screamin that's a Western mayday but
No ones comin to save yo ass, you stay lost
Like Amelia Earheart somewhere in the jungle grassCelebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homocides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and dillusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone
Tragically casulties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now

Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way

(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(Yeah, better days ahead)
Better days ahead
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead

That's real
I feel your pain nigga
I used to be just like you nigga
Before I got off in this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did do
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing
I went out and got my own ya feel me?
So from me to you, man to man
Better days ahead my nigga
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on
Cause I'm a get mine regardless
Nigga wether I'm rapping or on the streets
I gotta have it[Intro: Shaq]
Yo Jef, why don't you give me a hoopa beat or something
Something I can go to the park to
Yeah, there you go, allright, I like that, I like that
It sound dope

(Bust 'em in the eye Shaq)

[Verse 1: Shaq]
You wanna fight? come fight me
I'll hit ya with the "wa-psh-psh-psh", see, see
I get dirty after dark, I'll treat you like Spielberg
You'll get your ass kicked in in a park
You don't believe me, the proof is in the pudding
Been a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding
I flip scrpits with the mad pa-style, freeze
Music please
I dribble rhymes like Basketball-ems
People call me E.T.,
(what's that Shaq man?)
Extra-Tallems
You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up liar!
I lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired
Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck
(hey yo, why you bug a hooker like that?)
Yo, she breathed down my neck!
People walk around like, Yo, they got charged!
But I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7" ain't large!
I kick rhymes like moduck-kwong do
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic
Like Cheech and Chong do
You don't like Shaq, frankly I don't give a damn
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 2: Def Jef]

Suprise, look who's back
Not a prize from a Cracker Jack
Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack
Flexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom-bap
Pass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back
Everybody said I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet
Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad
Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex
You know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex
The way I see, if I was wack like you I'd be at me
The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity
Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, my title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard
Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape didn't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nuthin
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand

[Verse 3:]

[Def Jef]
Ah yeah, yall don't know nothing about this
The Shaq Man and The Arsenal

Double XL in the nine-ohs kid
Skills to make mills.
Big up, Flava Unit, Funky Town pros, upstate, yeah ??? ya large
So check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all
The brothers and sister know.....

[Shaq]
Nah, nah, let me continue
I'm a be like Pete Rock and see what's next on the menu
Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka
Rocks from here to Mecca
Boom shack-a-lak-a-lak-a.
I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle
Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel
My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks
The brand new like Heavy
Built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?)
I can hold my own
Knick-knack shaq-attack, give a dog a bone
Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend
Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, "Baby, baby, baby!"
"Every once, every twice, three times a lady."
Is what I listend to, riding with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Outro: Shaq]
I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech
Ron Mac, and my other cousin Ron
This is another rough shot from the arsenal
And you know what? Booty rappers, stay booty
Ha-ha-ha, and we out

Ahhh ha ha ha ha
Ahhhhh ha ha ha ha
Ahhhh...psyche!Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go

[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my Glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

[Hook]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[ X4 ]

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling wolf tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a ho and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millimeter
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

(Chorus)
Keep control...

(Tragedy the Intelligent Hoodlum)
When I made arrest the president, America ate me
Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me
They labeled me a prejudice poet
I'm speaking the truth as I know it
I hold on but it's hard for me to handle
Too much lies, corruption and scandal
Cops want to kill a brother or two
Who do you call when the gang wears blue
I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man
My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger
I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer
Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor
Mali troops will run through your resident
In my hand will be the head of your president
All you fess that made a check to throwdown
Will rise up for a political showdown

Chorus

(King Tee)
Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip
Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip
Of the ropes and chains that kept us
Since we were black they didn't want to except us
But it's ok, I got my own plan
Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program
The natives cook, wash and clean
And to the rubbers that throw in the scene
M-A-N-D-E-L-A
Now you got a chance to hear what he say
Since they kept him locked up for so long
Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong
But we need to all stand together though
And let the red, black and green show
Become aware of yourself before it gets too late
Another message from King Tee the great

Chorus

(Grand Puba)
Yo bust it
Hung wit the flip, got a ?dooby? wig
Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man got zits
Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi
Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends
Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy
Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy
Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids
And the man caught a nice thick bitch
Now the bitch is on skid
Screaming how she hates her kids
The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy
Think slick, she better get wit the wick
Cause foul, foul, foul is your style
You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile
See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song
How long must this go on

Chorus

(Def Jef)
Power now or never, together forever
And ever, sever make it endever
To enlight your brother when
I recommend to extend a hand
Expand it then wish strength to fend
Black women and men from the white power structure
They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya
And you gave birth to a nation
You freelabel laid America's economic foundation
Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years
But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears
The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables
Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels
And years of classroom fables, fiction
Fallacies all sorts and fabrications
?For sarge? even fuss
Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts

Chorus

(Chubb Rock)
I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen
And knowing his father slowing
And his mother is hoeing
And now should he be growing
He's too young to be sewing
He should just chill and be flowing
I know he was being malested and sold
And his mom for being infected
Never check it, so I invested
My time and made sure little bro was looked at
Pops got evicted, not a smack
Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless?
The bum got done by the one
And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip
Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip
It confuses and bent ill thoughts
In the soul of the youngster
Is daddy a monster
That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain
Drys and open your eyes for the insane

ChorusMobbin, straight billin through the eastside
Never had a site to rhyme, but I'm still mobbin

[Goldie Loc]
Dope dealers, to the fullest
I keep my Glock, stuffed with rocks, so watch out for the bullets
Eastside, young nigga sportin them chucks
Never givin a fuck, so watch out for the come up
Them eastside niggas be the crip, crip, craziest
Ride wit my niggas fool we gon die for this
No need to be a punk just dump when I say so
Empty the clip another block let's go
I don't give a fuck about some posted what
So C slide me the mac so I can rip shit up
We ain't finished with this mission so listen to whats crackin
We ain't rollin wit you niggas that's scared to do the jackin
The plan don't stop nigga, fuck the cops
If a nigga snitch he the first nigga to drop
That's all my game, we ride like macked up trucks
You know them niggas on the eastside be givin it up
Just blast for me, and I'mma blast for you
When I'm in jail, get cash, and I'mma mash for you
That's on the real homeboy don't let me down
I clown homeboy and I bang the pound

HOOK: Tray Deee

And when we come through real niggas stand beside us
Killers, cutthroats, and knivers
Bringin it the livest, and leavin no survivors

[Tray Deee]
I still wear the same pair of khakis least three days
Nappy ass french braids and it ain't no thang
Hang with motherfuckers wanted for all types of crimes
Plus them little bitty niggas on they bikes wit nines
On the grind no I rhyme nigga times is hard
Got jugs of water buried all across my yard
One time on my line tryin ta find a cause
Toss a nigga in the street and reach up under my balls
Guns cocked, mug shots, cell blocks and locked down
But I done made it too far to stop now
Results of a banger, to most I'mma danger
No hope for those who come to close to the chamber
Bitches lovin I'mma gangster so fuck it
No matta if I hafta I get at em in a bucket
Tuckin in my shirt and all that shit don't work
First look, say I'mma crook that did dirt for the turf
High talk, high walk, when I stalk the street
Gurantee who try to see me come across the feet
It's a eastside lifestyle, wild and foul
Goin out, puttin it down sayin fuck the trial
Aim is to be famous wit major loot
A gang of juice, in case I gots to bring the troops
And everybody know the eastside the craziest
So motherfuckers know it ain't no fadin this

HOOK 2X[Verse 1:]
Alice lives in a land
That I am envious of
Yellow dragons
Violet cats
And black talking purple knobs
She steps on anything
That might get in her way of home

Alice had love
But she pushed all of her people away
She felt as if she was alone
Distant, ugly, afraid
She didn't know that her life was already made

You're loved
And you will find
Someone with your frame of mind
So if you'd be so kind to not cross that line

And fall into a world
Where everything is flipped
And where you fly to swim
And you fly to drive

[Chorus:]
Fly with me in the sea
Swim with me in the breeze
Drive with me on the clouds
Fly with me on the ground

Follow me into my rabbit hole
I'll show you everything I've been told
I'll lead you to a land unknown
Where happiness is grown

[Verse 2:]
I live in a world
That Alice would be envious of
Everybody's mind is closed
There falls a white dove

Find your treasured feather
And you better treat it right
Petals can unfold all at one time
Or all at the drop of a dime

With tragic reds
And joyous reds of a blue yesterday
It makes me crazy
To hear of your purple yellow haze

Alice had it great
I wanna be like her some day
In a world where everything is flipped
And people are stuck in a maze

[Repeat Chorus:](22 million black victims of Americanism are waking up)

As-salaam-alaikum, blackman
Time to make a stand
Time to wake up, and
Time to make a plan and band
Together like China
We need to find a
Better form of unity
Then we'll be
In the right path, on the right track
Dark or light black
Don't let em tell you it's wrong to fight back
(Come on)
But the enemy is not your brother
It's that other muthafucka
The one that baited, robbed and degraded you
And he don't like to see you've made it through
The bullshit that came with bein a brotherman
Stolen from the motherland
Placed in another land?
400 and some odd years ago
Till about the time we wore afros
We've come so far so fast
]From what they call the past
But that just passed
And we're the last in line for justice, what's this?
Naw man, that ain't gon' work, yo, bust this
Black to the future, back to the past
History is a mystery, cause it has
All the info
You need to know
Where you're from, why'd you come
And that'll tell you where you're going

(We gotta unite
We gotta work together in unity and harmony)

Black to the future

(Come on)  (3x)

(Into the future)

Black to the future, what a funky concept
A poet with soul, brothers and sisters, let's step
Together in sync, just think about the outcome
We know where we're goin, because we know where we came from
A united state of mind
But not the kind
That the United States government fakes
(Nope) They don't practise what they preach
Maybe they don't believe in those false beliefs
Themselves, and I can tell, cause they look scared
To see us comin up, because they're not prepared
For a new breed of leaders
Eager and fired up
And tired of
The lies you feed us
So we just
(What?)
Got together like one nation under a groove
Gettin down, and the funk of it can move
And start a movement of self-improvement
And before you know it, you went

Black to the future

Black to the
F-u-t-
U-r-e

(Get on up)
(Come on)
(Get on up, brotherman)

(I want you to get on up)

I grab the mic with a kung-fu grip
So it don't slip, and come out on a positive black tip
Hip all my brothers and sisters to the real deal
With unity and knowledge I feel we'll
Uprise, who knows what lies
Ahead, but you can't see if you're livin with shut eyes
So realize, united we stand, divided we fall
Provided we all heed the call
Comin from the muslim, or the rasta man
Two forms of a positive blackman
W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T
King and X, Farrakhan and Jesse
Men with means that differ
But their goals were equal
To uplift African people
Through violence or non-violence, I don't care
As long as we get there (Where?)

Black to the future

(Into the future)

What a funky concept

[ Man ]	Hey brother
	Excuse me, man
	I don't mean to bother you, man
	But I -
	Brother, you think I can get a little bit change from you?
[ Jef ]	Some change, man?
[ Man ]	Yeah man, I just need a little bit change, man
	You give me some change
	That's all I'm askin
[ Jef ]	Aight man, I'm gon' give you this change, man
	But I want you to listen to me for a second, alright?
[ Man ]	Alright man, whatcha got to say?
[ Jef ]	Brothers always talkin about change
	Brothers'll change their clothes
	To go out on the street and make some quick change
	A brother might even kill another brother over the wrong change
	Brothers change from men to women
	Brothers change their hair from natural to that damn jherri curl
	Brothers even change their eyes, man
	Brothers always talkin bout change
	Goin through changes
	Changes, changes, changes
	But when it come time for a real change
	Brothers change their mind, man
[ Man ]	Aw man, I -  I hear you, man
	Hey man, you gave me more change than I asked for
	You must be one of them revolutionaries, man...(Def Jef)
Somebody leave me by the name I'm able
I drop more niggas than a record label
You couldn't see me if your TV had cable
I got more juice than an orange and in a minute
I'm a have it made skill trade, going through crews
Like a phase I hit harder than the news about a death in family
I keep kickin my shit as long as my niggas understand me
Smash ya Grammy watch em try to ban me
Like they ran me outta town nigga
You can't stop that sound from the underground
Let me educate you when you hear it you learn
In other words I'll impregnate you with my lyrical sperm
So no matter how far you go away you'll have a piece of me with you, look
I drop more jewels than the clumsy I'm off the hook
I've never been took or taken bring home the loot
Forget the bacon you need to change your shampoo
Cause you be flakin one two watcha wanna do
If you sneeze before you hit the boom
I'll tell your god budda bless you
You don't know nuttin about this hear me out
The way you wear me out I swear I might as well be an outfit
Of course I doubt if you can house it
I sit and see what you come out wit
Just like I thought, you ain't about shit
You gettin over with tracks them rhymes is wack
When you hear me mention R&B, you know I mean "Real Black"
Instead of rap, you catchin flack
Ain't sayin jack I stay in tack cause that (?)
Run not deaf at budda sack and the congac
X a contract show me cash no check
Forget your A&R man and your record exec
Tryin a flex, if I punched you in the ear you couldn't hear a hit
They call me Def Jef cause I ain't even tryin ta hear that shit
I seen a rappers career plummet and learn from it
Money had it but couldn't hold it he ain't really want it
I got covered betta than a jim hat shit
Give me the mic and a gym mat cause I'm about to flip

(Voodu)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
When I walk the night, looking for something to sacrifice
My presence is more feared than the Anti-Christ
My mental transitions cut like incisions
My intellect's deeper than moon ditches
I break a nigga down to his blood type device
Sliced leaving trails of broken mics
So what the fuck you wanna do
When I begin to construct indestructible
Brands of verbal bombardments, I'm the sergeant
When my army of words deploy reminds me of the ?law?
Bianca murders destroy all in my lane
Fom the snows of the Ukraine to the sands of Spain
I crumple competition crushin they're outta commission
My shit be switching like sex positions
No target missin like James Earl Ray
Booth and Oswald I assassinate blastin
(?) your eye across the walls (?) stalled keep it all in your way
Shootin ya down niggas be screamin that's a Western mayday but
No ones comin to save yo ass, you stay lost

Verse 1

I do work and I'm workin' it with the will of a warrior
I'll take on 54 of ya, nah, I'll even take more of ya
Competition is great, and keeps me in shape
And it's mentally stimulatin'
Competitors constantly contemplatin' challenge
Champion's written all on my face
And I'm smirkin', and lurkin' back in the back
Attacking and hacking and jacking
Smacking up losers that's lacking
Characteristics of poets, they blow it
Tryna show it, yo if I'm flowin' they know it, so it
Compels me to step and release the rhymes that I kept
In case of an urgent emergency then these words'd be weapons
Any discrepancy heard'll have to be handled in haste
At any pace when I step in the place, cos I came to do work

Verse 2

Lyrically thorough, I'm from the borough of Manhattan
And when I moved to the Bronx, then I got into rappin'
Funky beats would control me
It's like the mic would say hold me
I do a solo, me only
I'd be alone but not lonely, cos
Eric would back me
The only track would be doubles
And when the rappers attacked me
They'd end up buried in rubble, cos
We never took losses, opposing forces proceeded
But they retreated, receded, beat it defeated
We did repeat it as needed
Kept 'em seated and some felt cheated
Gave 'em all second tries and still I superseded
I'm a souped superior subsidiary of soul
I keep the crowd in control, cos I do work

Verse 3

I got a need and it's bleedin'
Inside of me to say words
Cos it's my choice and I'm voicin'
Just what I think should be heard
To a sleazy easy goin'
Lazy laid back track
The pace is slow, the bass is low
And yo, I'm ready to go
Do my job, I'm obligated, devoted and dedicated
And loaded and motivated to show that I know the way that it's
Supposed to be done, that's why I chose to become
Professional in this profession, droppin' rhymes on drums
It's automatic that static comes automatically to me
I've had it for longest been at it
So call it fad, it doesn't
Sweat me or get me uncivilized like a savage
I play it civil and give all I got to keep up the image of
Rap cos I happen to be a rapper and poet
Not just rappin' to be rappin' in case you didn't know it
Here's the deal, cos I feel
You oughta be up on what's new

Etta: Drop it 'til your soul feel free...
Jef: Alright

Verse 1

[Jef]

Yo man, give me that microphone and sit down
Cos a brother like me is known to get down
So get up from the rhyme and you'll find
It's designed to give sight to the blind and enlighten the mind
And the lines are arranged in a strange unorthodox style
That knocks you out the box and blocks the competition
On a mission, fishin' in an empty tank
Comin' up blank
Crank the drums up so I can hear it
And it sums up, the thumbs up on the lyrics
And I'm droppin' it
Heavy like lead...we're dumb, kid
Can you pick the perfect poet out the patch?
E he scratches, I make the words match
Try to catch up and you'll break your jaw
Don't laugh, I heard it happened before
Some sap said, "That nigga can't rap"
I had to pull back the trigger and cap
A full round of rhymes and aim for the head
Not to put it to bed, but instead
Pick his brains just like a psychiatrist
He had no idea that I could just
Mentally took the brother for bad
I just wanted to see what kinda knowledge he had
He wasn't too bright so I had to shed some light
And now me and the kid's alright
He heard 'Give It Here' and had no idea I get dumb
I be droppin' rhymes on drums...

[Etta]

Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free
Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free (hey, hey-hey)
Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free
Yeah yeah, hey hey, hey
[I just wanna holler when my soul feel free now]

Verse 2

[Jef]

Made in Manhattan, bred in the Bronx, boy
I ain't no toy, I'll destroy
Any form of competitor
In the form of a predator
I'll stay ahead of the comp. one jump
I know where I'm goin', yo and where I'm from
I was taught to go for mine
Even if I had to throw for mine that's fine
But I left the neighbourhood
Just cos I came to Cali don't mean I went Hollywood
I'm still good and why shouldn't I kick it?
Stay awhile the freestyle is wicked
Rough and rugged, but it's not ragged
Cos it's not the way Def Jef does it
When I get in it I rhyme infinite
And that means forever
Whether obstacles in the way hinder
They bother me not a bit, cos hey
Small things are nothin' to a giant
When rappers get defiant
I ain't scared, I'm prepared
Within my realm no souls are spared
Don't try to read me, you'll be baffled
Before you test me you best be careful
Cos you have no idea where I'm comin' from
I be droppin' rhymes on drums...

[Etta]

Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free
Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free, (hey, hey-hey)
Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free
Do it, do it, 'til your soul feel free

Verse 3

[Jef]

Like a bear not your ordinaire, call me a grizzly
Like a bee I'm bound to bust busy
Expressing all thoughts with the notion in positive mode
God offered the ride and I rode
Listeners riding along with the legend in motion
Yeah, you knew I had the potion
A pinch of pizzazz and a smidgen of sincere savvy
A funky beat, and what have we here?
Not a mere but a major
A flavour you savour so tasteful, so watch your behaviour
Yeah, dope is what I gave ya
But you don't smoke or sniff, this dope'll save ya
From suckers you've been subjected to
Listenin' to, I'll rescue you
S.O.S in effect with Def Jef and DJ Erick Vaan
Rockin' you on
Friend or foe I'll take you blow by blow
If you're a king then you know I'll overthrow
So please don't provoke me, this ain't no joke, see?
You feel pain by every stroke of the pen
I don't mean to be a jinx, but then
When you come against me your career's at an end
I'll attack with a rap that is apt to attract
Basic hip-hoppers cos basics are back
Oops, made a mistake, I'm in a daze
With me nothin's basic, let me rephrase
Wonderful words, adjectives and verbs
Nouns by the pound, superb speeches and slurs
Simply supplying a subtle suggestion
If you're selecting make me your selection
Upon completion of suckers deleted
The poet with soul will calmly be seated
Thinkin' "I'm good and you knew it"
Rhymes grow and flow so smooth like a fluid
Or liquid...with high liquidity
I'm turnin' rap to cash in a flash
But money's not the name of the game or my claim to fame
To make you rock is my one and only aim
There's no comparison to what I've become

Song: Gee, Officer Krupke

[Excuse me, Mister Officer, you think we're bad, huh?
You wanna clean up the streets, huh?
Well you better put society in handcuffs
Ha-ha! You got a hard job!]

Music by Bernstein, lyrics by Sondheim
I'm talking 'bout 'West Side Story', it's before my time
Police sweat me like the Sharks and the Jets
Because I do what I does so they wanna get me
If you let me, I'll explain the game
Clear my name and show you ain't a damn thing changed
So don't criticise the way that I parlay
This ain't Broadway, we learned it the hard way

Dear, kindly Sgt. Krupke you gotta understand
It's just our bringing up-key that gets us out of hand
Our mothers all are junkies, our fathers all are drunks
Golly-moses, naturally we're punks
Gee, Officer Krupke we're very upset
We never had the love that every child ought to get
We ain't no delinquents, we're misunderstood
Deep down inside us there is good (there is good)
There is good, there is good, there is untapped good
Look inside, the worst of us is good

You see Officer Krupke, you gotta have some compassion
You know you're always harrassing me
But what you don't understand is I come from a broken home
My mama don't care about me, my daddy don't care about me
And you're always gettin' on my case
It ain't me, homeboy, it's society

Dear, kindly Judge, Your Honor, my parents treat me rough
With all their marijuana they won't give me a puff!
They didn't wanna have me but somehow I was had
Leapin' lizards, that's why I'm so bad
Right, Officer Krupke, you're really a square
This boy don't need a judge he needs an analyst here
It's just a neurosys that oughta be curbed
He's psychologically disturbed (he's disturbed)
We're disturbed, we're disturbed, we're the most disturbed
We're psychologically disturbed

We're out of our minds, you know what I'm sayin?
Yeah, because we got problems deep down inside
I ain't got no analyst to go to
And sit down on the couch to find out why I'm disturbed
I know why I'm disturbed, and you know what?
I don't care cuz it's just like that
And that's just how it is, you know what I'm sayin'?
That's the way it is: crazy!

My father is a bastard, my mom's an S.O.B
My grandpa's always plastered, my grandma pushes tea
My sister wears a mustache, my brother wears a dress
Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess
Officer Krupke, you're really a slob
This boy don't need a doctor just a good honest job
Society played him a terrible trick
Socialogically he's sick (we are sick)
We are sick, we are sick, we are sick, sick, sick
Like we're socialogically sick

[In other words, this is what happens when cousins marry
We are panero heads, in-bred
Hey, we're like Chicano Forest Gump]

Kindly social worker, they say go earn a buck
Like be a soda jerker which means like be a schmuck
It's not I'm anti-social, I'm only anti-work
Gloriaski, now that's why I'm a jerk
Officer Krupke, you done it again
This boy don't need a job he needs a year in the pen
It ain't just a question of misunderstood
Deep, down inside he ain't no damn good
We're no good, we're no good, we're no earthly good
Like a pest, a bug ain't no damn good

The trouble is he's crazy, the trouble is he drinks
The problem is he's lazy, the trouble is he stinks
The trouble is he's growin', the trouble is he's grown
Krupke, we've got troubles of our own
Gee, Officer Krupke, we're down on our knees
Cuz no one wants a fella with a social disease
Gee, Officer Krupke, what are we to do?
Gee, Officer Krupke, krup you![VERSE 1]
Excuse me, baby, haven't I seen you before?
I don't forget faces, and I'm pretty sure
That I know you from a long time ago
I was in the 12th grade, you were a grade below
I used to see you in the halls, goin to class
And when you saw me pass, you switched that as-
Tronomical butt from the left to the right
And you would give me letters sayin (call me tonight)
Now your face was pretty, and your body was hot
So then I thought to myself, and said, why not?
You can be the skeezer, I'll be the skeezee
I knock the boots, and you're strung on me
But I have to admit, you were a whole lotta woman
You had to be good, cause you kept me comin
Then I graduated, and I left town
That's why you haven't really seen me around
But after all these years, you're still lookin good
And if we got together, I know you would
Reminisce and miss this Def Jef kiss
I respark the flame, and I knew you'd just
Wanna give it here

Give it here

(Give it to me, give it to me)

[VERSE 2]
I got a fat bank account, I'm pretty comfortable
But hey, I'm very picky bout the girls I pull
Because nowadays you never know
If girls like you, or they like your dough
They always say, "Buy me that", and I say, "Buy you what?
You better keep your mouth shut and do the butt strut"
Cause I'm not spendin a dime until you spend some time
Givin me what I want, cause I'm in my prime
And you know what I want, so don't even play dumb
Girl, give me some, and I can make you come
Back to my house at all times in the mornin
You won't have to say, cause I know what you be wantin
You know the routine, so assume the position
I'ma take my pole, and I'ma cold go fishin
Like a tootsie-pop. you know that I last long
And if you can't sing. you be singin this song
Give it here

(Give it to me)

(Oh)
(Oh, you gotta give me some now)

[VERSE 3]
Because you promised me the day that you quit you boyfriend
You'd let me in, so tell me when
Because you had me waitin and waitin for such a long time
You keep tellin me that it's the wrong time
You're makin it harder and harder
For me to control, and hold back that part of
Me that needs you, and wants to please you
Cause I know what you like, and I'll do more than HE do
So stop trippin, too late to start flippin
Before you start lippin, you need to go slip in-
To the negligé that I got you for your birthday
And don't be scared, cause I came prepared
So if you're old enough to give me shot
And if you're bold enough to take all I got
Don't say that you're ready if you really are not
Cause - mh, when I get hot
I'll give you more than anyone before
I'm not Prince, but I'll do you like you never been done before
Let's get together, I know we fit together
Like a hand and glove, come on and get this love
Just give it here

Give it here

(Give it to me, baby)

Yeah baby
You know I like it like that
Of course I love spendin time with you
You know you're my one and only
Ehm - ehm - hold it
What was your name again?[Daz talkin]
Man, I need a hit
Yea, what's goin on over here
You know my nigga got the fat ass motherfuckin bags
Yo, 'sup!
What you got
Yea, you know, comin to buy you out
I know you got that fire

[Daz]
We hit the liquor sto'
Grab some Satin, limonade, cool-aid and fuck the fo'-0
Blaze the indo
Me and E-White and Snoop Dogg in the fo'-do' caddy
With that sticky icky shit, nigga blaze a fatty
My people know me when I touch down the soul
I have it, bring it up my nigga
Puff the bud and bag it
Lace my filas, adjust my tamps and grab my heaters
Khakis and wife-beaters and blaze the fuckin weed up
Yea, you know we did that
Git back and say I did that
Is that the bomb shizzat
That put me on my bizzack
Purple orange the flavour of the month in a blunt
Whatever you need, I got what you want
I got dat

[Uncle Reo Chorus]
(fire, I'm on fire)
Ooooh I'm on fire
(fire, fire)
And I don't wanna be pulled out
(fire, I'm on fire)
I wanna keep on burnin
(fire, fire)
Forever I'm on fire

[E-White]
Something so hot it leave me sweat
Bairly breathin soakin wet
Don't expect me to be close up on it unless you let me
I bet cha it is better for us both to let me close
Is you 'bout it, keep private shit that jump off in the closet
Baby what you want, I hope Daz got a blunt
I hope Snoop will let me swoop in Snoop DeVille so I can stunt
Straight fire baby
Take it back to the wire maybe
I can find what I was lookin fo'
A wide open hooka ho'
Mad dog cuz I'm lookin on
Cuz it ain't no bitch in me
Picture any nigga disrespectin when he mention me
This could be the start of something good so let's make it happen
Get back to the hood
The whole time me and my niggas smoke that

[Uncle Reo Chorus]
(fire, I'm on fire)
Ooooh baby you set my soul on fire
(fire, fire)
With the thing that you do to me
(fire, fire)
I wanna let you know
(fire, fire)
That I'm on, I'm on fire

[Snoop Dogg]
Im electrifyin, dramatisin, recognizin, victimisin
Fratinizin, scandalizin, realizin, tantilizin
Analizin, sexasizin, vandalizin, enterprisin
Maximizin all this shit
Runnin my game and I call that bitch
Put her in a stable
See if shes able
Sit her at the table
Yea shes able
Will she do it, she got to do it
I run these hoes like Clark Gable
Raid these labels
Enable myself to turn the tables to increase my wealth
Move stealth was the tech on the shelf
Try to keep to myself
I don't bother nobody
Usually when I fall in a party
Shit I become the life of the party
And everybody wanna smoke with the big dog with the big dope
Its doggy dizzle and he wizzle
And my lil kin fizzle
Daz Dilly is so silly
Still he will he blaze another philly
Stick it together and blow your mind
Probably so like Donahoe
But I ain't tryin to find a ho
And if I'm rhymin too fast, thats cuz you movin too slow
You don't know, you won't know
Just hit some of this for the mental *chock sound*
Uhhmmm now let that shit go
Now, you know, we know, he know, she know
That boss D-O-G original weed smokin
It's always

[Uncle Reo Chorus]
(fire, I'm on fire)
On fire
(fire, fire)
And I don't never ever wanna be put down
(fire, I'm on fire)
Are you high
(fire, fire)
Whoa, never ever wanna ever be pulled down
Baby, you just don't know that you  got my soul on fire
I don't ever be pulled out(25% of the couples in this country
Are estimated to be in violent relationships)

[ VERSE 1: The Poetess ]
Growin up as a kid I never understood the things my dad did
Like hittin my mother, me and my brother hid
In the parlor from the chaos, the cryin and the cussin
The fightin and the fussin
I used to go to bed holdin my ears tight
Filled with fear when I hear moms and pops fight
I never quite understood what the reasons were
How could he love my mother if he kept on hittin her?
I don't know, but what I do know is this
Love hurts when it's comin from the throw of a fist
And the list goes on from the mental to the physical
Use of verbal abuse, beatdowns, it ain't cool
It's bad enough we got it rough in society
Opression and poverty, no need to be fightin e-
Ach other, a brother hits a sister, and he's a bigger nigga
He ain't nothin if he gotta hit, pick a
Innocent victim three times smaller in size
Head honcho, macho in whose eyes?
Only a fool tries abuse to utilize
Phyisical force to control, hurt, brutalize
Time for change, to rearrange the chain of thought
Unball your fist and think of the pain was brought
To the hearts of your brother or your sis
Love hurts when it's comin from the fist

[ Def Jef ]
Now I want you to think of six women that's close to you
And I want you to think if somebody was beatin on em
What would you do?

[ VERSE 2: Def Jef ]
I wish my step pop would stop hittin on moms
She got bruises on her arm from protectin her face from harm
Bein done he looks at me and says, "What you're seein, son
Is me disciplinin my woman
You're gonna hate me for the rest of your life
But this is my wife"
And I'm thinkin I wanna stab him with a steak knife
Too little to interfere, I wish he would disappear
But he won't, so I put the pillow over my ear in fear
Dreamin when I get to be a man I'ma stand up to him
If I see him hit her again I'ma do him
I encourage her to go, she says, "No
I love him, I stay"
"Mom, what you see in that idiot anyway?
He beats you and mistreats you
Daddy wouldn't do that"
But she said: "Your daddy did it too"
Ain't that much love in the world to be gettin bruised for
Used, abused or even singin the blues for
He's addicted to inflictin abuse, he said he'll quit
If he's the one with the habit, then why you always takin the hit?
A weak later the same shit - I doubt it
I'm grown now, mommy, don't even worry about it

(In 20% of child abuse cases a spouse will be involved in)

[ VERSE 3: The Poetess ]
I was twelve years old when daddy started to get rough
Puff in one hand, the other holdin a glass of that 80 proof stuff
He never got enough, I thought he was tough, but it was all a bluff
I tried to understand and got verbally beat down
But I thought one day he would come around
But man, oh man, was I mistaken
Nothing's right in his life and the abuse I was takin
I was accused of things I never thought of
Good grace got no praise
But I got a lotta negative words thrown in my heart like a dart
With the point of steel
Killin me softly at his will
The big one came when I got the blame for
Not bein the joy of a boy that he aimed for
One day I came home, he was sittin in the chair by the front do'
Just waitin to let go
(Where you been all night, out hoein?)
He didn't raise, rolled up in his gut, I got a blow
And that was it, the last hit, he'll ever do
The pearl handle was popped and cocked and it blew
The only thing on my mind was payback, let's say that
I've put an end to that madness and pray that
I can overcome what mentally dad did well
While I count the days in my padded cell

(Several women a day are killed by ah, battering)

(Listen to the hit)	--] Ice Cube

[ VERSE 4: Kool G. Rap ]
Does he love her or does he hate her?
That's what I'm thinkin as I look at mommy hooked up to a respirator
It started with a smack
And that smack became a punch and then a kick and then a broken back
But mommy never dropped dime
Now she's damn near blind, yo, what the hell is on my pop's mind?
I feel like gettin daddy done in
And put like one in his gun and pull the trigger and start runnin
Man, I see the walls turnin red
I'm gettin kinda fed so instead of the lead, how bout a burnin bed?
In order for my mother to last
So while he's laid up, straight up, I be puttin some gas on his ass
Blow him up like a grenade
And this is for all the times my mother used to wear shades
Tryin to cover the damage he did her
So when that fire's on your ass you remember how you hit her

[ The Poetess ]
This is a special dedication for my sister Dee
And all the sisters out there that have been physically and mentally abused
I like to send a special thanks to Def Jef
And my sister Almighty
And definitely Mister Kool G. Rap
Peace from the Poetess(Aw yeah) (4X)
(Everybody get down) (4X)

Verse 1:

I give my all when the rhyme's involved
When I take to the mic, emcees dissolve
When I break to the mic it's cause I'm eager to rap
And if you're down to cooperate, I need you to clap
To the beat, souls or even applause
For a worthy cause because without no pause
Def Jef has the floor for the next four minutes
And this is the place to be and you're in it
Time to get loose and get busy so get wit it
[?] I'm like a rhyme after rhyme as if a poem, admit it
Well-spoken, fluent, bright like neon
Man of me, speed on before you get tee'd on
I don't mean suckers cause suckers are suckers
[?] I make it to the coast and the well-known others
Challenging the meek does nothing for my conscience
The best in the biz is who I like get it on with
On the real tip

(Everybody get down) (2X)

Verse 2:
Rhythm is like a religion to me
Cause I know that my talent God's given to me
To do what I do with the utmost poise
I'm making good music and I'm making noise
I'm making dollars and I'm making sense
Saying rhyme's I'm sure you're for and not against
[?] Urban not rules so you're led not plural
I write my rhyme's on the paper just like I'm painting a mural
I'm a lyrical miracle and when I play around
You could say I'm satirical
But when it's time to do work, you know that I'ma do work
Cause I only have time to rhyme, bust it
If rap was an event at the Olympics
I'd confidently compete, than why then pick me
For the bronze, gold and silver
9.9s cause they know that I will verbally
Motivate all the fans in the stands
Start the clapping of hands and the marching of bands
Keep the topic full and at a steady pace
And you'll be eating it up cause you love the taste
On the real tip

(Everybody get down) (4X)

Verse 3:

There's a reason for the rhyme cause the rhyme with reason
Always on time and the rhyme is pleasing
To the ear, smooth and clear
Because I want to make sure that you can hear me
Exercising my right to my freedom of speech
Ignoring suckers cause I really don't need 'em to teach
Because I don't need schoolin' cause I ain't no pupil
Still I pull more party people than you pull
Any given day, any given time
Any given place, bring a mic and I'll rhyme
In front of 5,000 people or in front of one
I'm so high-powered cause I'm a son of a gun
I'm running things, stunning kings
Rhymes come in a bulk, making emcees sulk
Always victorious in a tournament
My opponents wish they died and was born again
To avoid the days that they were gunning for me
Little did they know, that they'd be running from me
I produce like sperm, I'm on supply like a rabbit
And it's never been a hobby, always been a habit
Standing ovation cause you get up when you see me
I got your father, brother and boyfriend trying to be me
My style puts a smile on your radio dial
And God blessed me with a beautiful child
On the real tip

(Aw yeah) (12X)
(Yes yes, y'all) (4X)
(To the beat, y'all) (4X)

Verse 4:

My vernacular is spectacular
I keep my words intact and as a matter of fact
You'll love my monologue and you say hot dog
It's all around me like bees but groupie please
Get back cause you're ripping up my gear
But that's what happens in this type of career
Especially when they want what I got and that's a lot
For example, I got a bass drum drum with the uptempo
And I show that I can got for what I know
I'm a craftsman, I'm like a draftsman
I plan with the pen and when I'm done I win
Because I never cease to amaze myself
And you don't phase me but I phase myself
My rhymes are sublime, my technique is unique
I execute like a gymnast and always land on my feet
I got lyrics in an overload and they're spilling
[?] And I'm full and I'm fill that's why they come off the feeling
I give you more not less cause you deserve the rest
I perturb the best and serve the rest
So emcees, go ahead and y'all talk all of that small talk
I'm Def Jef, I'll show you that I'm not all talk
And no action, I can't be brought down
And incidentally, I'm mentally fit to hold the fort down
On the real tip (2X)As I wake up in the mornin, I jump up out a my bed
Freedom is on my mind as I place this six by nine cell
Nigga ain't seen daylight, they got me caged like, I'm runnin wild
Just for tryna' feed myself, since they act like we ain't even here
So I say, I've done no wrong, I wanna go home now
Ain't tryna listen to that
The niggas I used to call, they ain't pickin up the phone now
Niggas know I'm trippin for that
I miss my mama, brotha, sistas, man, I'm feelin so alone now
Wish that I could go back
I guess I'm payin the dues of a real true soldier

(Chorus)
It's so hard on the street so I packs my heat
That's the life of a thug, any beef I keep
I'm suited up to kill, all my enemies
If you don't shoot I will, you ain't no friend of me
Now that I'm livin in a cell, the tables are turned
I never knew I had such a lesson to learn
I'm shackled up from my hands to my shoes
I'm so caught up I don't know what to do

I got a letter in the mail from my girl, she let me know
That I'm too thuggish for her world, so she need to let me go
Plus her mama playa hatin sayin datin me is dangerous
She don't think she should hang with thugs
She probably better off though
Run in back and tell the broad she can go, give my mama all my clothes
The keys to my low-low to my brother
Bitch, if niggas tell me you in my shit you will be fucked up
This shit ain't right
Lawyer say that ?? we got that bitch tonight
He say she down to ride, with young niggas like me
Two strikes and I violated my probation
Plus they say they get me if they ever saw my face again
So I, be spendin more time, as a Thug on the Line
Did the crime so I'm doin the time

(Chorus)

Tomorrow mornin, I'm scheduled for the court room
Voices in my head sayin, "Nigga, what you gon' do?"
No soon, I be ridin that big blue bus
Chained up with the killas and the thugs
Tossed all night in my bunk, waitin for the judge to send me up
I knew just what it was when I got cuffed
That that would be the last time I would see the sun
First I picture myself in jail, that vision wack
Then I picture myself rollin my Cadillac
Bounce, bounce, side to side, hittin switches
Pullin off on them bitches, just tryna' get it
But then I flash back cause my cell door slam
Now I got to go see the man, damn
Now we bailin down the hallway
Niggas yellin, "keep it real," nigga always, always

(Chorus)[Malcolm X]
But when it comes to uhh
Protecting the lives of twenty-two million Afro-Americans
Then all of a sudden, Uncle Sam becomes very concious, of legality..

[Ed O.G.]
Here's the reason that, I've been upset for a while
Cause if you're black you get life, but if you're white you're on trial
Ain't nuttin to it, just like that chump Charles Stewart
They're always claimin, that the devil made me do it
For insurance, he killed his wife and his child
And blamed it on a brother, and racists got buckwild
He had the media, believin the, aesop fable
And all the whites were like, "I can't wait 'til
They catch the bastard - I hope they fry him"
They were sure that he did it, there was no need to try him
And Willy Bennett, who was in it to win it
Got bassed and harassed cause they was sure that he did it
And the thing that really pissed me off and truly offended me
Is the suckers wanted to reinstate the death penalty
For a brother man, but not the other man
And when they found out, he killer her hisself, hmm on the other hand
Now it's inhumane, bring it back they wouldn't dare
But his brother confessed he was with it, so give HIM the chair
But that won't happen with that punk Dukakis
Flynn and Mickey Roach, you better just watch for us
I don't wanna hear that you're sorry to me
After you tore up, and started a war up in the black community
It's out of the news, but it's still in my head
Charles Stewart still lives even though the sucker's dead
I'ma speak upon it

[Malcolm X]
He is trying to wipe, you, out
Trying to eliminate your total existance
With falsehood and lies
And he's succeeding in doing it!

[Ace&Quan]
Now here's a verse about a relative, that coulda lived
But killed by a cop that thought negative
UHH, shot in the back like a victim of Jesse James
Tell them his motherfuckin name!
Phillip Pernell, murdered by a devil
That never saw a cell, so I'm here to raise hell and tell
About a child that was left to decay
And the next couple of days the pig was suspended with pay
Receivin support from cops and superior courts
And all we receive is a bullet inside a corpse
Now tell me, what type of justice has been done
What woulda happened if I shot his son?
I woulda been killed, taken to a chamber and filled up with gas
But yet nothin has happened to (?)
So I had to take two extra steps
And put it on wax, cause I couldn't let it rest (why?)
Cause I can't stand to see Satan smile
And get away with takin the life of a child
You meant to do it, so now your motto is (tell 'em)
The more bullets, the less blacks live (you better)
Watch your back you murderer because you're wanted (uhh)
But for now, yo, I guess I gotta speak upon it

[Malcolm X]
We've got to come together
Pool our efforts, our strength, our finance
And build our own nation
The Chinese did it, it's called Chinatown!

[Def Jef]
Let me speak upon this with a radical take as I take
Time to talk about the systematical break-down
And deliberate destruction through miseducation
Of the Nubian Nation
Startin in kindergarten, continuin through college
They continue to kick you trick knowledge
And call it education but I call it trainin
Washin your brain into gainin and maintainin
The American dream, but to me it's a nightmare
Because they keeps ya right where
They want you to be, mentally, physically, and monetarily
As you go merrily merrily merrily
Down the stream but it's more like up shit's creek
Without a paddle and the boat's got a leak
We start drownin in all that shit, gettin deeper
Mind's in a chokehold or should I say a sleeper
But I ain't goin out like Rip Van Winkle
So you can't gas me up anymore, and I think you know
That I can see clearly now the rain is gone
It's bright outside, I see the light, and I'mma speak upon it

YouknowhatI'msayin?
Cause all that shit they taught me in school amounted up to ZERO
(Word is bond!)
Abraham Lincoln ain't my motherfuckin hero, y'knowhatI'msayin?
(That Devil ain't my hero neither)
Word up, yo this is Def Jef the poet with soul
Coolin with my man Eddie O.G
On a funky funky funky funky funky funky track
(Yeah, Bulldogs is out there, y'knahmsayin?
ShaQuan, peace to you and Ace, y'knahmsayin?
Peace to Teddy Ted, Special K, DJ Doc, Ramos
Yeah boys, the soul brothers, y'knahmsayin?)
Oh yeah yeah, Craig B. (?) Love and the Legend
And DJ Eric Vaughn, hah
(Word up)
Yeah

[Malcolm X]
Notice this!
They put "In God We Trust" on a dollar bill
They don't even have it on a church
And don't even open the verses of their bible
But on the dollar bill is a big sign "In God We Trust," correct?
Then they have, on the back of the dollar bill
The key, the scales, the pyramids
All of the symbols of bondage, slavery
How they took the country, who they took it from
Who you ARE, the builders of the pyramids
Without your EYES..
You are the builders of the pyramids without your EYES
Because you don't know you did it
Why don't he know?
Because a traitor, taught him to eat wrong foods, since he was a baby
Put pork in him - has you eatin pigs feet and ribs
Has you livin in his image
And took away your divinity
And replacin it, with his low animalization..
{*fades out*}
