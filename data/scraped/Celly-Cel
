It's goin down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted
Hit the mall to get it
Then I stop to get my hair twisted up in pony tails
Then sell a bill, back to the grain
And let my peoples know, you know it's goin down tonight
Man, we livin
I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin
We ridin we them heat, as if they funk
And them we dumpin
I'm slumpin in the meantime
My speakers is jumpin up out they box
I see these broads choosin, man they sprung on my Shirly locks
Ugh, made the block
And they was all up on my bumper
Tryin to pull me over
But now I gets at nothin when I'm sober
Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie
Bendin corners, laughin cuz I left they car cloudy
Went to my patna house, an they was posted , splittin Vegas
Bet five dollars a game on Madden '95 on Sega
Tackin out the room, fools layin on the ground
They better have some get back cuz tonight it's goin down

[Kerry]

Tonight it goes down
It's goin down tonight
Tonight it goes down

Tonight it goes down

Tonight it's gonna go down

[Celly]
Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin bones
Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home
Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash
Yellin "stand up!" when you pass
Turn over your bones and give me your cash
I hit the sto', with the money I won to get me a 4-0
8 double 0 on the scene, I'm a O-G on the E fo' sho'
I get twisted up in knots, perm straight sloppy
Prize breeders on my nuts and haters wanna mock me
Cain't understand how deep I get when I spit this real on reel to reel
Straight up out the hills
In a minute we steal toe, boot stompin, bobbin my head
To the walkmen and get my knees dirty
While I'm stinging them on the dice for twomps and
Side bettin, Little Joe in the doe now watch me roll
I let 'em go and watch that double duece lock up fo' sho'
I talks bad and clown
Walkin around and makin my rounds
Snatchin my money up off the ground
Cuz tonight it's goin down

Repeat 1

[Celly]
Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall
Jumped in my 7-4, smashin cuz I'm tight ya'll
Checkin to see if the tape was on the passenger seat
I need some heat
The only way I'mma creep
Late night through these faulty streets
Hit the block & seen the whole crew on the corner
Smellin that aroma, talkin about the bump and comin up on her
Super fast, sumpin cool
You know how we do it
Touch 'em wit some game
And fill em with some doing fluid
We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin in
Give me some C&B, some Hennessy and Seagrams Gin
Lemon squeeze but no chasin, fool we straight lacin
Jumpin & mobbin, punchin 'til the both of us playas racin
We pulls up and see 'em posted outside gettin gone
I'm in the zone, ready to take me somethin home
Wall to wall breaders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin down
At this bump I found
Tonight fool, it's goin down

Repeat 1 to fade[Celly Cel]
I roll 360 degrees and slidin' to the function
Shirley-locks in my hair, yelling 'Bump Something'
Menage-a-trois, need about three with me in this spot
Mixing up my Drizze while they stizz up on that row, but
See, I'm a ridah, when I flash it ain't nowhere to hide ya
I'm right besides ya 'bout to let these thangs all up inside ya
There ain't no sense tryin' to knock a playa for the way he lounge
Even the haters in your town sing it's going down

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Up in the spot, fool got popped, killed a cop, jumped in a drop
That was the life he lived but now it's honded
Imagine your dome posted on America's Most Wanted
They flowned it and locked him up for conniving
Whether the strong surviving
Or getting pimped by the system
I still be 4 1 5 ing it down to the V
With that fool Celly C E L L
Shakin' it, breakin' it, movin' it with this clientele
With this underground, it's going down
Ha ha

Grew up on that: who put dem hickeys on your neck?
Ugh, how many babies did you make off that Keith Sweat?

So if it's going down tonight

[Celly Cel]
It's going down so majorly my pager battery
Stay on low cells while I'm trying to get some mo' mail
Dodgin' hot ones, makin' liquor store runs
Creepin' through the city streets, pervin' and I'm on one
Can't get wrapped up in that "He said she said"
What was said already did, runnin' your mouth will get you filled with lead
So I stay real, soakin' that game outta the hills
Ridin' with that Mazda sound
Now you know it's going down

Repeat 1 to fade(E-40)
Hey ah, which way should I steer ah
The beat keeps knockin down my rear view mirror
Pervin like a mothafucka swervin
Hope I don't scrub in my '95 Suburban
To go throughout the community squattin on gold tippy toes
Peep, breathin on Indian cigarette-Ganish Bidi posin niggas tweak
Quick fast and a hurry don't worry 40 vision blurry
Shorty hit the freeways clownin like that nigga Joe Torre
(Celly Cel)

Sippin DP eatin lobster
Don't get it confused you won't get abused
As long as you makin' me them revenues

If I was popeye I woulda told bluto

Last night I had a superbad in my room
She sucked me till my dick shriveled up like a prune

They got no time to be trippin' on niggas
That's tryin' to keep me down
I put that bump in your trunk and lace the nation's underground
Let them know about the ghetto mentality
Niggas get smoked for nothing at all
They want you up out of the game
When they see you get on your feet and ball
Faulty niggas never run me off my cellar lot, I always kick it
I ain't never had it
I wanna see every black man in the world with a meal ticket
Eatin' steak and lobster, crackin' crab, sippin' Don P 'til they hurl
But in the meantime speakin' for all my niggas
Fuck tha world!

[Silkk]
Man, I just touched down, me and Celly conversate on some plan
Until we got lip on the bud, 'fore this shit get up outta hand
Fuck niggas hatin', fuck a nigga lovin', I deal with it
See, I'm a No Limit Soldier, when it tops, I get Sick Wid' It
Niggas better stop like a sign or get drop like a dime

I lets my nuts hang then put these niggas the flash to go insane
Oh, that be me, let's kick it; just don't pull your tech late
We ride up on you and catch you slippin', checkmate!
Lie down and best watch out everything, nowadays you can't trust
Now one of these niggas, they coulda been paid to put a head out on us
You understandin' me like I say
"Keep it in the family, man, you can't miss"
Eliminate them haters and yo' mix, fuck tha world and feel bitch!

[Silkk]
Be about your money, nigga, all about your scratch
Everyday I gotta plot and make it
'til I'm on top to make my dollars and stats
On the real, we big time fuckin' ballers
Niggas, shot callers, lay in 'em drop tops, gold thangs and M-40's
Well you gotta have big paper, nigga, just to fuckin' kick it
Ain't no bitches in the streets, nigga, this motherfucker get wicked
See, a multi-pep nigga, but I be TRU to this shit
First of all, about my money, fuck a bitch
I'm tryin' to get rich! Ugh!

Repeat 1

[Celly Cel]
Crept from the bottom, man, I struggled all my motherfucking life
Use to have a razor blade, sliced through solid A1, wide knots
The only way to get some scrilla;
If you knockin,' then fuck what you talkin'
Broke ass nigga everybody in the hood own thangs, and you walkin'
You the same type of niggas that hate on everything that a playa do
Always talkin' about "I woulda done this, I woulda done that" Fuck you!
Wark ass nigga, don't wanna see they don't get nothing
Don't wanna give me no props
Smile on your face; when you post-up, stab you in the back
When you need a bluff

[Silkk]
Well, fuck 'em! Cuz, see, we be all about our payday
]From South to the West, bitch, we connect, bitch

Or get bang like some hoes or get hang like some clothes
When I be get done I'ma slap you like some motherfucking doe
But if only you blow, nigga, red like some rose

And bust a right Coney Island pop the trunk and started cappin'
Niggas was happenin' put they Burboun to the floor nigga
Hard to bust back but I was penetrating they doe

You niggas didn't know that I was outta control
Slow yo roll for I put this chopper straight to yo fo
Head you better off dead than to fuck around with psycho niggas
Don't be trying to plead yo case cuz I don't even like no niggas
In my face, trying to question me about some drama
Only answer to two people: God and my mama
Far as niggas tryin' to put me in the cross
Let 'em holler at my bitch, Nina Ross ho house boss
I bet you mind somethin' in, run and tell a friend
[?] on the Gin, I think he's set trippin' once again
It ain't no stoppin' me, get at me then I'm dumpin' on ya
Ridin past yo funeral hangin out the window slumpin' on ya
You didn't know, they didn't tell you boy you betta listen
While I shoot this shit before you put yourself in that position
Niggas that know me know I specialize in havin bump
You can have the tailway from the shovel so we can pop the trunk

[Pimp C] - Smokin' at the tittie bar I had to pop the trunk

[Bun B]
Under Cali's blue skies, smokin' on chronicles and chocolate ties
Even when we tell the truth the hoes we lies
Man ain't no disguise, doin' ninety week flies
Ain't got no time for middle men and small fries
Only money conversation and big thighs
Let me talk to your boss man, the nigga wit the pies
And back yo ass up and don't act so surprised
When pistols start to cock, hands start to rise
Nobody move too fast I advise
Or you can catch a hot one right between ya eyes
Recognize I done set me sights on the prize
And put lights out with boom biddy bye, bye's
I'm livin' my life off of rap and weed highs
And act my age but not my fuckin' shoe size
But fuckin' wit us ain't wise
We get crunk, we came to pop the trunk
What, the trunk

[Bun B] - These niggas keep talkin' like they want the funk

D time, PA, uh, '97
Smoke somethin
Representin money, like Too $hort bitch
Huh[ VERSE 1 ]
One by one goes the bullets in the clip
Put it in yo gat, one in the chamber, now you're ready to start shit
Heat comin from the barrel with a cloud of smoke
Dead bodies on the ground when these fools get loc'ed
It's crazy in the street, pack some heat for a sucker
Mobbin through the town tryin to murder muthafuckas
211's every day, liquor store and bank jobs
D boys gettin robbed, niggas get jacked for they mobbs
What's a nigga to do, can't survive without a gun
Snitches in the street, a nigga livin on the run
It's fun but the pen is like smokin sess
Locked up on a 187'll make any nigga stress
You can wear a vest, it won't stop two to the head
Shot you in your face and now your ass is better off dead
Talkin shit'll get you smoked quick
No need to save a ho because they can't live without dick
So I focus on the mail, Celly Cel
Ain't no playa-hatin nigga, I got too much heat to sell
Fairy tales I never kick, it's gangsterism in my veins
I kicked it with the O.G.'s pickin up on game:
Get your money on, fuck a bitch and get ghost
And keep one in the chamber for them fools that play you close
Them Sick Wid' It niggas keep makin the beat 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ Hook (2X) ]
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Them Sick Wid' It nigga got the beat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
That nigga Celly Cel got some heat 4 yo azz

[ VERSE 2 ]
Them Sick Wid' It niggas got the beat up comin with some heat
Them federal muthafuckas tryin to get a buck in the streets
Every day a nigga wanna test yo skill
And playa-hatas hate to see a nigga comin real
The H-i-double l-s-i-d-e
Down with the P.G., niggas don't wanna see me
Act a fuckin fool, shootin up the city
Happy on the trigger like my nigga Frank Nitty
Let's get into the C thang, Hillside slang
It's a Hillside thang from the Hillside, mang
Smokin em like a chronic sack, rollin em in a zag
Hittin em with the funk and zippin em up in bodybags
Everywhere I go fools get to actin crazy
Wanna let they nuts hang, thinkin they can fade me
So I keep a life-long mug on my face
Rollin with some heat, sippin on a straight lace
A high speed chase, bank it in the side pocket
Po-po's can't fuck with the 350 rocket
Under my hood it's all good when I'm on the gas
Checkin the rollers and the jackers that try to blast
Tricks of the trade already made, gangster got it down
Never panic under pressure when it's goin down
Droppin a bomb, nigga, mobb beats 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Breakin em off somethin proper for the nine-fo'
In the do' is some of that heat 4 yo azz, ho
Little hoes and the don't-know's need to know
A nigga that flow who ain't comin out the gate slow
Pimpin and and pandlin, ho handlin the whole bit
Killers move in silence, nigga, I don't talk shit
I see them loudmouth niggas keep gettin dead
And the silent ones on 25 to life bids
You gotta pack some heat in the street, it's goin down
If you ain't down you better move to a square town
Niggas talk shit, drink and smoke weed up
Hit the county jail straight p.c.-ed up
You never know who really down till the funk jump
Same one that jump and the finger points at the punk
And your crew wasn't down from the get-go
Don't you know how that bitch-made nigga shit go?
Hollow points get to the point quicker
Cause talkin shit full of liquor thinkin that you're sicker
Than the next nigga'll get you full of bullet holes
Stayin on my toes and I just can't let go
Of this mobb shit that I kick 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ Hook ]Bitch I got beam like Scotty
Leave you spotty
When I point this aim at your brain
And leave them hollow thangs in your body
Lodi-dodi I drinks Bacardi
Gets dick hard drunk
When I'm off that skunk punk
And you don't wanna dance tingo tango
I let my left right mingle mangle
To your jaw southpaw
It oughta be a law against these thangs I throw
About to lay some shit down with Celly Cel and Bo
From the Garden Blocc
Hillside got they Glock
Mack 10's
Mobb shit'll neva end
I'm tryin' to have it all
So I ball 'till I'm gold
Mobbin' through a sixty usin' cruise control

C-Bo:
I'm fuckin' wit that click nigga
That big nigga on the block
With Glocks, Rag Tops
Cut thangs on them gold knocks
Better watch your back 'cuz we strapped with teks
Push up in a blue Lex'
And dump caps to your neck
Mobb shit
Bustaz all die
Leather trench
Brim and two nines
Costume of a killa
At your bed side holdin' on two millas
Uggh we bust them teks close range
Livin' estranged

And you can't fuck wit these
Get smothered with a half a key
Bitch

Celly Cel:
Give me the ball and I'mma fill the lane like 'Fenney
Hardaway 'cuz I'm out to get every penny
Any nigga disrespectin' when I'm checkin' for my scrilla
I know'm stilla wig splittin' killa ain't no realla
Nigga realla than me
Mobbin' through your hood and takin' heads
Slumpin' hangin out the windows dumpin'
And shakin' 'Feds
So mind your own
Cross the line and see how quick they gone
Head blown decapitated caught slippin' in my zone

Fuckin' with this Mobb shit
Niggas get they wig split

C-Bo:
Uggh it's the murder man posted at the front door
And when they comes I dumps with both four-four's
Letin' 'em have it 'cuz I'm static
Dumpin the grass
Killed his ass
And then kneel down and get my last laugh
Punk bitch shouldn't have tripped
Now he lay dead in the ditch
Ass ripped
Suckin' on his own dick
Money talk
Bullshit walk
Fool this ain't no sunshine
Three killas
One garden blocc, two hillside

B-Legit:
This shit's fucked and I am tag teamin' with the murder man
And that'll hurt a man
Niggas doin' dirt and
All you got to do is hop your ass in my 'Cut
We'll be back tomorrow mornin'
Cell, you comin' or what?
I got this gut feelin'
About to make the killin' for a livin'
The contract said the nigga wore a wire tap
And they want him dead
A hundred G's for his head
And leave a bloody glove down where that body bled

Celly Cel:
Red rum is what I'm hummin' as I hit the fence
Homicide looked for prints but found no evidence
Stuffed his head in the duffel bag and zipped it up
Them ballas want to see his face before they break us off a cut
There it is cashed him like some chips at Reno
Slid us a briefcase full of crispy ass C-Notes
Made the hit
Got the scrilla
Gone without a trace
B behind the wheel
And Bo Loc cuffed to the briefcase
Yo' nigga Cell got the chopper 'case they on my trail
If it's a tail then I'mma leave a 50 empty shells
Pistol smokin'
These niggas know we ain't no jokin'
Split up the tokens
And I'm back in the hood loccin'

Fuckin' with this Mobb shit
Niggas get they wig split

B-Legit:
Yeah, like a real hillside strangler, yola slanger, tryin to get a
Buck but if I'm fucked in the gas chamber
The autopsy red, them niggas had some heat fo yo ass
And never leave your block without your Glock, clip and mask
Haters hatin but its all game related and that's what we do bitch[Verse 1: Celly Cel]
A slave to the hood, have no money in my pants
Rollin wit some heat to make a mutha fucka dance
Had a chance to bubble, had my hustle but I blew that
I walked up in the gun store, an ran out wit a new gat
A double four, I don't want my million dolla mission
211, bitches kissin on my chrome wit skrillas in my vision
Can't move wit out the mail, wanna hustle
So I figga I go out there when they posted up an rush a nigga

[Verse 2: E-40]
But I can go anotha way, (notha way)
Hopefully payday, (payday)
What if I slipped and say I dislocated my hip and sued them
That's my new get back
All kinds listen to that flavor
The racateerin, racateerin
Copy bootin-legger
Or however, whatever
Long as the weathers clever
My feelin the house might become a snitch fo the vice
Ain't no tellin, ain't no tellin
That's what Harold told Melvin. Ten millaaaa
Make a nigga bleed fo the skrilla

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Three drunk niggas wit they gages loaded (Gages loaded)
55 kicks in them agents ho (Agents ho)
But I don't wanna beef, cuz the game be fake (Game be fake!)
Strip a mutha fucka fo his cars and money (Fo his cars and money)
Tagged up a 600 SEL (Yeah)

[Verse 4: B-Legit]

Cryin havin fits, but I'm in it fo the skrilla bitch

[Verse 6: E-40]
Gotta fertilize yo cash an make it greener
Electrictronic scale triple beamer
Juss as sneaky as I wanna be, trifle do
Fuck goin by the books and stickin to them rules

[Verse 7: B-Legit]
Ten is the limit on the card I'm holdin
Citibank Visa, but the card is stolen
Retail price, just pay me half
But you gotta come right with the cash

[Hook: 2x]

[Verse 8: E-40]
I done took a few heads fo the skriller Bay
Hope it don't come back an haunt me
Got funk wit like seven different crews
Cuz I done jacked, kidnapped, an did dirt to them fools
Watch my back
Been lookin over my shoulder blades
Hella sneaky cuz I heard them niggas got grenades
I'm from the Bay so regardless what I'm caught up in, this tangle
Can't get up out the Dodge, wit this federal beeper on my ankle

[Verse 9: B-Legit]
Mutha fuckaz don't ride fair no mo
Get snatched out the 9-6, 5 point 0
Took to the hills to get stapled man
While a nigga ride off in a Stang

[Verse 10 : Celly Cel]
Man I need some ends
But to get the ends I gotta sin
Fuck it, let me page a nigga, lie bout what I'm a spend
Bring me a pound, I got it sold on this side of town
You got that yey, you weigh, I pay, fool that's how it's goin down
Bring it in zippers, an I'm a bring the body ripper
The big dipper, wit an extra thirty round clipper
He brought it back, weighed out to the fullest
Little did he know I had his name engraved on my bullet
Dumpin like a fool, served, nigga pumpin gas
Had that heat fo his ass, took his yey an all his cash
I made him feel a, money hungry blood spilla
Straight killa, I did it fo the skrilla

[Hook: 2x][Intro]
Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthafucka
Once again, you know
'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all
You know, nothin' but that realness
Can ya feel this though
Yeah.. Gonna ride wit ya nigga cuz it's goin' down

They say break yo'self or make yo'self
So I said fuck it, bought a Glock so I could take myself
Through all this soft shit a nigga face as a youngsta
Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster
OG's hoopin' at the school house & shootin' dice
In & out the pen, real niggas made nothin' nice
Made this hog hit the brew
Made me hit the weed
Eatin' up the whole house
Moms know a nigga keyed
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door
Tellin' myself "I ain't smokin' weed no more"
But you know
Them lies as the days go by
Me, Choo-Choo & Clyde smokin' dank 'til the sun rise
Walk into the school house
Franklin Junior
Back when it was cool to kiss & tell and spread rumors
Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle
Sockin' mutha-fuckas 'til they eyes turn purple
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1
Fools throwin' thangs to the end
Back then, it was fun
No gunshots
No need to hit the floor
But after shool
The whole city loccin up
At Wilson park fool
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs
Chasin' Fly Balls for hot dogs & fries bitch
But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit

1 - (Can't tell me shit)
Bitch made niggas can't tell a nigga shit
(They can't tell me shit)
Skanlezz Azz Bytchez can't tell a nigga shit
(Can't tell me shit)
Punk police can't tell a nigga shit
(They can't tell a nigga shit)
Fuck you bitch - you can't tell a nigga shit

Repeat 1

Got a little older, now the park is a joke
Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope
Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip
Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit
So I mind my own, find my home
Now I'm in the zone
Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on
Had 10 dollas & JB gave me the other 10
Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind
Brakes went to quarters, halfs, ounces & QP's
The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's
Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go
To Hogan High cause there be bitches at the talent show
Football & hoop games had hoes
Vallejo and Hogan, you know it was on fo' sho'
Reece assists & Redge with the Tamahawk dunk
Then the whole town, mobbin' down to the waterfront
Niggas in Granadas, Cougars & Mustangs
Stars & Volvos
Nobody fuckin' with them ? thangs
Me, G-Roc, JB & Lil' C-Mo
Puffin' on indo
Splittin' 4 double O Z's
Young G's tryin' to live
And when they shut the ship door, we goin' under the bridge
Gettin' whip-lash from the brake gas mash and dip
Cause back then, you couldn't tell a nigga shit

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Made it to a G, but ain't no love in my city
Now we set trippin', all these fools actin' shitty
Niggas wanna reel me in, but didn't know
When you fuckin' wit the big fish, you fuckin' wit a funeral
No more toe to toe
HK-44's
Now what they know about the mutha fuckin' murda shows
Strap on my right hand side, in the Bay area
Shit is gettin' scarier
Niggas will bury ya'
Fuck the bird, I'm the nigga bailin' through early
Trigga happy nigga wit a head fulla Shirlies, on
Christian brothas and chasin' it with Schlitz
Or drinkin' hurricanes wit my niggas in da click
So deep, I can't call it
Spend about a million dollas at the liquor store
I'm just an alcoholic
40, Water & Legit put me on the map
Got my foot in the door, now I'm givin' up dap
Sick Wit It slash Jive, my 9 to 5
The shit I used to dream about is how I survive
Lifestyle of a mack
Funk for life
Some Heat 4 Yo' Azz
Them Killa Kali niggas blast and smash
Without a murda weapon or a witness
Too many niggas in yo' car, risky business
They turn snitches
Break down & have the po-po's at yo' front door
And all real niggas know
Who rides sucka-free, on the solo
When you empty the clip, they can't tell a nigga shit

Repeat 1
Repeat 1[Ant Banks]
Now come and take the realness
Fuckin' these funky hoes will make you feel this
Drippin' sensation stickin' your ace in the wrong place
And you'll be ass out dickless, passin' out when you get this
AIDS shit in your grave, ditch will be dug with a quickness
So this is the phase of the days when I grew up
Reminiscin' and trippin' off all them hoes I done fucked
But it's all good and plenty, I just can't count how many trampy hoes I done did it to
Licked it, did it, split it too
But shit is cool makin' the thrilla of Manilla
Scoop up the scrilla boy that cuchi be a killa
You can feel a order up with a nut and then bounce
And have that ass comin' up shorter than a fuckin' quarter ounce

[Gangsta P]
Let's get toe down off some X-O, puffin' on the cripto
Bent corner eyers up on her, super bad low down dirty shame
No need to know your age, bitch, what's your name?
Said her name was Tammy, lived with her granny
All I'm thinkin' about is gettin' in her panties
Got the digits, called her later on that night
At a two dome sex, flossin' big elex
Cocked the roof back, bitch, blaze the sack
Reached the destination, no hesitation
Out of my clothes in the guts about to nut
No protection, after two hours hopped out the shower
Dressed in Eddie Bauer, livin' like a true playas should
Six years later: test positive cause the ho was no good

[Hook]
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with me
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck
If you wanna get your groove on, come and do a little somethin' with me
If you wanna get your groove on, let's wrap it up before we fuck

[Celly Cel]
A-I-D crooked letter
Mothafuckas better strap up when they come together
It's a top notch so you ain't thinkin'
Got your battlefields sinkin', caught late night full of weed, drinkin'
Got ya creepin' in the unknown
Steered you wrong even if you get your head blown, fool, you still gone
Switch up your tactics: fuck with prophylaxis
It ain't about that raw dickin' her and nuttin' on the mattress
You didn't know these hoes will put the tags on your toes
Don't knows crossin' up the game because she chose
Listen to your homie Celly, nigga, before you hit the telly, nigga
Have a box of rubbers ready, nigga

[Almon D of 187-Fac]
I can't lie, this whole AIDS situation got my brain drownin' in illusions
Settin' niggas up for the conclusions
I ain't sayin' that I'm gonna live forever
Gotsta fuck new, get sometime in the future
Don't got no babies, what about the day when you get married
I hope I'm layin' in bed with a virgin with a meal that's urgent
She heard that I was livin' my lifestyle lavishly
Flashbacks of fuckin' her cousin in the alley
Smokin' on the twamp sack that she bought the jimmy hats
Three O'clock in the morning, sideways I was cuttin' the Pontiac strapped

[Hook]

[Den-Fenn of 187-Fac]
Well, here's a serious situation that we facin'
It starts off by doin' the nasty without no patience
Forgettin' about the condom, usin' and abusin' the drugs and methinfedamies
She wanted to suck my dick head so bad she was beggin' me
So I stepped to this straight bitch named Sally, Sally
Threw my slugs at a scallywag at a club in the valley
Leather trench, all hair down to her shoulders and back
Some Guess jeans all deep down and her pussy read fat
To be exact one of my niggas pulled my coat tail
And told me that the bitch was hectic: A-I to the D-S infected

[G-Nut of 187-Fac]
Mothafuckas be runnin' up in this bitch without no prophylactics
Filthy tactics, may as well pull the strap to your head and blast it
Suicidal decisions, livin' your life on the edge slippin'
With one foot off in the grave and the other one on a banana peelin'
But I ain't trippin', red ribbons on my chest
No chemotherapy treatments needed cause I'm a make it stretch
To my climax, strapped all over my dick
And when I digs I blow they mind back and then I grab my shit

[Hook]

[Spice 1]
Some of you niggas can't even say condoms
Some niggas be talkin' about conderves or condos, straight raw dickin' hoes
You don't know that ho, man, that bitch can't be trusted
Better be strapped with about four condoms if you plan on keeping your life
You're gonna be feelin' kinda fucked up and faulty
When you rappin' up on that stage and your dick fall off into the audience
Silent but deadly way of murder, it's mighty sick
Gotta have a bullet proof vest for your dick
Seventeen with the fat hydraulics
See, us west coast niggas is the most psychotic
Hittin' switches in my old school with four, fuck three pumps
My homie said that bitch had more pizzazz than "P" funk
I'm peepin' in the bitch out at the ho spot
Tryin' to throw that virus to my homie
Betta watch these bitches cause they're fake and phony

[Hook][ VERSE 1 ]
One by one goes the bullets in the clip
Put it in yo gat, one in the chamber, now you're ready to start shit
Heat comin from the barrel with a cloud of smoke
Dead bodies on the ground when these fools get loc'ed
It's crazy in the street, pack some heat for a sucker
Mobbin through the town tryin to murder muthafuckas
211's every day, liquor store and bank jobs
D boys gettin robbed, niggas get jacked for they mobbs
What's a nigga to do, can't survive without a gun
Snitches in the street, a nigga livin on the run
It's fun but the pen is like smokin sess
Locked up on a 187'll make any nigga stress
You can wear a vest, it won't stop two to the head
Shot you in your face and now your ass is better off dead
Talkin shit'll get you smoked quick
No need to save a ho because they can't live without dick
So I focus on the mail, Celly Cel
Ain't no playa-hatin nigga, I got too much heat to sell
Fairy tales I never kick, it's gangsterism in my veins
I kicked it with the O.G.'s pickin up on game:
Get your money on, fuck a bitch and get ghost
And keep one in the chamber for them fools that play you close
Them Sick Wid' It niggas keep makin the beat 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ Hook (2X) ]
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Them Sick Wid' It nigga got the beat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
Some heat 4 yo azz
That nigga Celly Cel got some heat 4 yo azz

[ VERSE 2 ]
Them Sick Wid' It niggas got the beat up comin with some heat
Them federal muthafuckas tryin to get a buck in the streets
Every day a nigga wanna test yo skill
And playa-hatas hate to see a nigga comin real
The H-i-double l-s-i-d-e
Down with the P.G., niggas don't wanna see me
Act a fuckin fool, shootin up the city
Happy on the trigger like my nigga Frank Nitty
Let's get into the C thang, Hillside slang
It's a Hillside thang from the Hillside, mang
Smokin em like a chronic sack, rollin em in a zag
Hittin em with the funk and zippin em up in bodybags
Everywhere I go fools get to actin crazy
Wanna let they nuts hang, thinkin they can fade me
So I keep a life-long mug on my face
Rollin with some heat, sippin on a straight lace
A high speed chase, bank it in the side pocket
Po-po's can't fuck with the 350 rocket
Under my hood it's all good when I'm on the gas
Checkin the rollers and the jackers that try to blast
Tricks of the trade already made, gangster got it down
Never panic under pressure when it's goin down
Droppin a bomb, nigga, mobb beats 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Breakin em off somethin proper for the nine-fo'
In the do' is some of that heat 4 yo azz, ho
Little hoes and the don't-know's need to know
A nigga that flow who ain't comin out the gate slow
Pimpin and and pandlin, ho handlin the whole bit
Killers move in silence, nigga, I don't talk shit
I see them loudmouth niggas keep gettin dead
And the silent ones on 25 to life bids
You gotta pack some heat in the street, it's goin down
If you ain't down you better move to a square town
Niggas talk shit, drink and smoke weed up
Hit the county jail straight p.c.-ed up
You never know who really down till the funk jump
Same one that jump and the finger points at the punk
And your crew wasn't down from the get-go
Don't you know how that bitch-made nigga shit go?
Hollow points get to the point quicker
Cause talkin shit full of liquor thinkin that you're sicker
Than the next nigga'll get you full of bullet holes
Stayin on my toes and I just can't let go
Of this mobb shit that I kick 4 yo azz
Ciggedy-Cel the figgedy-funky nigga got some heat 4 yo azz

[ Hook ](E-40)
Hey ah, which way should I steer ah
The beat keeps knockin down my rear view mirror
Pervin like a mothafucka swervin
Hope I don't scrub in my '95 Suburban
To go throughout the community squattin on gold tippy toes
Peep, breathin on Indian cigarette-Ganish Bidi posin niggas tweak
Quick fast and a hurry don't worry 40 vision blurry
Shorty hit the freeways clownin like that nigga Joe Torre
(Celly Cel)
What do you know it's siggity Cel
That funky niggaro that funky nigga doe
Kickin in doors you beta grab ya ho
I see ya cruisin in the late night
Creepin wit my nigga B-Legit and 40 water, ah shit

We're here-we're there-we're everywhere
Highly intox-icated but we don't care
(B-Legit)
I'm from the H.I.L.L. the place where my niggas bell
A mack muthafuckin 12 will send your ass straight to hell

Biatch

Chorus-

H.I.L.L side doe
Spittin straight game is all a nigga know and ahh
And they be like... (there they go,off to the liquor store)
(B)
I tell a bitch what the fuck you mean where I've been
And so what I smells like pussy and gin
I had money to make
Bitches to break and if the shit was out of line I had lives to take
I told you from the gate that I'm a mobster
Sippin DP eatin lobster
Don't get it confused you won't get abused
As long as you makin' me them revenues
(Cel)
That miggity mack, that diggity dang and that niggity nut
Jump in the back of my cut with a tramp slut and hit the gut
Ain't got no love for 'em all I love to do is dick 'em
Pass 'em to the extra mannish nigga 40 water stick em
(40)
If I was popeye I woulda told bluto
You could kiss my big black royal
I'm not funkin' over Olive oil
Last night I had a superbad in my room
She sucked me till my dick shriveled up like a prune
(Cel)
Well pass the Hussy to the left hand side
So I can bend her over hit it from the back and let her ride
You know a Sick Wid It
Hog gotta put the shake down
Shot her to the left nigga hit me with the break down

Chorus
(40)
Beefeater, Tanqueray, sapphire, Bombay

All the way to sunday,monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday
Threw up money tore up ass botch you call the po po on me

Sheriffs pull my ass over, and book me caught me with a gun
And a bunch of Alize bottles and they was askin me where I'm from
And I said bitch

Chorus[Celly]
It's goin down tonight, you know I gots to go get fitted

Then I stop to get my hair twisted up in pony tails
Then sell a bill, back to the grain
And let my peoples know, you know it's goin down tonight
Man, we livin
I got the 4-1-1 on the bumpin
We ridin we them heat, as if they funk
And them we dumpin
I'm slumpin in the meantime
My speakers is jumpin up out they box
I see these broads choosin, man they sprung on my Shirly locks
Ugh, made the block
And they was all up on my bumper
Tryin to pull me over
But now I gets at nothin when I'm sober
Hit the gas and smoked it up, smashed off, I'm outtie
Bendin corners, laughin cuz I left they car cloudy
Went to my patna house, an they was posted , splittin Vegas
Bet five dollars a game on Madden '95 on Sega
Tackin out the room, fools layin on the ground
They better have some get back cuz tonight it's goin down

[Kerry]

Tonight it goes down

[Celly]
Closed up shop on the Sega, now we slammin bones
Up in my hood, it's on, we make a casino up out yo' home
Head up, I sets 'em down fast for the stash
Yellin "stand up!" when you pass
Turn over your bones and give me your cash
I hit the sto', with the money I won to get me a 4-0
8 double 0 on the scene, I'm a O-G on the E fo' sho'
I get twisted up in knots, perm straight sloppy
Prize breeders on my nuts and haters wanna mock me
Cain't understand how deep I get when I spit this real on reel to reel
Straight up out the hills
In a minute we steal toe, boot stompin, bobbin my head
To the walkmen and get my knees dirty
While I'm stinging them on the dice for twomps and
Side bettin, Little Joe in the doe now watch me roll
I let 'em go and watch that double duece lock up fo' sho'
I talks bad and clown
Walkin around and makin my rounds
Snatchin my money up off the ground
Cuz tonight it's goin down

Repeat 1

[Celly]
Shot to the house to get dressed, it's finally night fall
Jumped in my 7-4, smashin cuz I'm tight ya'll
Checkin to see if the tape was on the passenger seat

The only way I'mma creep
Late night through these faulty streets
Hit the block & seen the whole crew on the corner
Smellin that aroma, talkin about the bump and comin up on her
Super fast, sumpin cool
You know how we do it
Touch 'em wit some game
And fill em with some doing fluid
We hit then store, it's about 30 playas bailin in

Lemon squeeze but no chasin, fool we straight lacin
Jumpin & mobbin, punchin 'til the both of us playas racin
We pulls up and see 'em posted outside gettin gone

Wall to wall breaders, top notch, it's mean, it's goin down
At this bump I found
Tonight fool, it's goin down

Repeat 1 to fade[Celly Cel]
I roll 360 degrees and slidin' to the function

Menage-a-trois, need about three with me in this spot
Mixing up my Drizze while they stizz up on that row, but
See, I'm a ridah, when I flash it ain't nowhere to hide ya
I'm right besides ya 'bout to let these thangs all up inside ya
There ain't no sense tryin' to knock a playa for the way he lounge
Even the haters in your town sing it's going down

[Rappin' 4-Tay]
Up in the spot, fool got popped, killed a cop, jumped in a drop
That was the life he lived but now it's honded
Imagine your dome posted on America's Most Wanted
They flowned it and locked him up for conniving
Whether the strong surviving
Or getting pimped by the system
I still be 4 1 5 ing it down to the V
With that fool Celly C E L L
Shakin' it, breakin' it, movin' it with this clientele
With this underground, it's going down
Ha ha

[Celly Cel]
It's going down so majorly my pager battery
Stay on low cells while I'm trying to get some mo' mail
Dodgin' hot ones, makin' liquor store runs
Creepin' through the city streets, pervin' and I'm on one
Can't get wrapped up in that "He said she said"
What was said already did, runnin' your mouth will get you filled with lead
So I stay real, soakin' that game outta the hills
Ridin' with that Mazda sound
Now you know it's going down

Repeat 1 to fade(Talk)
Good evening
Welcome to channel 187 Murder 1 News
Tonight we focus on the city of Vallejo in the state of California
Where five black men were found dead at the water front
From various gunshot wounds
This brings the homicide rate in the state of California to one of the
Highest in the nation
And is now known to you as killa kali

(Verse 1)
The state of California niggas call it killa kali
Murder weapons in the river bodies found in the alleys
Bring the yellow tape
Body bags gettin zipped up
Heads blown off wit they insides ripped up
Mobile phones flipped up
Factors callin shots
Bitch made niggas its some real niggas on the block
Cause every hood got a trigga happy nigga
That don't give a fuck about puttin two in your liver
But how you figure you can do dirt and stay clean
Niggas like that get pronounced dead on the scene
Ain't no winnin teams cause everybody taken losses in they hood
Reminiscin on they niggas man I wish I could
Bring back the homies that I lost up in that funk season
Gotta check myself or let that alcohol be the reason
So I just poor a little liquor on the concrete
For my dead homies and the ones who ain't gone see the streets
Locked up with the rest of the locs
But whatever the reason my folks are walkin the yard
Or gettin they guts some
Tryin to make it home but I think they
Safer in that pin cause niggas on gin be lettin them Mack 10's
Bust 32 times
And niggas who ain't in it gettin shot by
Standards on the block
Smokin like bomb
Fools giving up they set
Gettin sideways leaven them t-shirts soakin wet
Retaliation is a must
So now you know them niggas you was funkin wit
Gone be at yo do so
Keep yo hand on yo nina in the valley
Or get dumped in the alley
Fuckin around in killa kali

(Chorus 1)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)
Mothers on they knees
Wit tears in they eyes why
(cause killa kali is the state of the drive by)

(Chorus 2)

(Verse 2)
The killins on
Ain't even safe when you at home
Whatever dirt you do
Gone follow you until you gone
So pack ya chrome
And handle your own cause potnas tend to run
Walked in the party 10 deep and only left wit one
Real nigga on your team
But you know how it is
Can't even trust them niggas that you knew since you was kids
It ain't no thang
I let them niggas have it to
Bitch up and I switch up on that ass before I blast you
And fools better watch them hoes in they mix
Seen them choosen and you bid on that set up for a six
Foot ditch with your family in front of you
So many niggas slip
That's how they slide a bitch up under you
I wonder whose the next nigga
To catch a bullet for sex nigga
Thought you was cock until they chopped you with them tecs nigga
I think the game is on its last leg
Trigga happy niggas wit no heart
It ain't no used to be
For your life
Cause out here they quick to take they own
Snortin that Peruvian
On Hennessey you know they gone
Can't tell a nigga shit in the 9-5
All about they scrilla doin niggas in on the side
Bellin through yo hood buckin fools down
Gettin caught slippin with they mutherfuckin pants down
Sleep with one eye open in the valley
Cause everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

(Chorus 1)

(Chorus 2)

(Verse 3)
California niggas be plottin on fools
Jackin mutherfuckers for them daytons
And leave that ol' school
Sittin on with yo face in the dash
Two in the back of yo head
Rip yo pockets of then laugh
Then you got them fools on the track pullin out Glocks
Pistol whippin niggas till they drop
Reach in they draws and take they rocks
They money
They rings and they chains
Without a skimask on
But can't complain
Its all in the game
Follow one of them ballers to  they residence
Tyin niggas up
Lookin for them dead presidents
Its for the money
You know the scratch but now we call it scrilla
It turned them kali niggas into straight killas
Set trippin on a daily basis
Vietnam ain't shit on what a nigga in the hood faces
1-8-7 case
Cop into a lesser charge
Three strikes
Hit you with that L
Lock behind bars
Bellin wit a strap
Punks seem like its waitin
To catch a nigga slippin or get killed over conversation
Fuckin wit bitch will get you killed quick
Niggas let they hoes mow down they homies on the real beitch
Fools come to kali thinkin club med
Caught up in the cross fire when them sets bump heads
Keep yo hand on ya nina in the valley
Or everything you love'll get smoked up in killa kali

(Chorus 1)[Pimp C]
Smoke somethin'
I just bought me a Coupe Deville
Took out the air bag put in a wood wheel
Now all the ATL niggas wanna jack cuz I'm from Texas
Never seen candy with the fifth on the back
I'm comin' down the west end, niggas tryin' to jack
And bust a right Coney Island pop the trunk and started cappin'
Niggas was happenin' put they Burboun to the floor nigga
Hard to bust back but I was penetrating they doe
Nigga in PA, it's like the wild, wild west
Cuz we all pack pistols and we all wear vests
When the shit pop out, who gon stunt
Nigga ain't shootin' me first I fin to pop the trunk

[UGK]
[Bun B] - These niggas keep talkin' like they want the funk

[Celly Cel]
You niggas didn't know that I was outta control
Slow yo roll for I put this chopper straight to yo fo
Head you better off dead than to fuck around with psycho niggas
Don't be trying to plead yo case cuz I don't even like no niggas
In my face, trying to question me about some drama
Only answer to two people: God and my mama
Far as niggas tryin' to put me in the cross
Let 'em holler at my bitch, Nina Ross ho house boss
I bet you mind somethin' in, run and tell a friend
[?] on the Gin, I think he's set trippin' once again
It ain't no stoppin' me, get at me then I'm dumpin' on ya
Ridin past yo funeral hangin out the window slumpin' on ya
You didn't know, they didn't tell you boy you betta listen
While I shoot this shit before you put yourself in that position
Niggas that know me know I specialize in havin bump
You can have the tailway from the shovel so we can pop the trunk

[UGK]

[Bun B] - These niggas keep talkin' like they want the funk
[Pimp C] - Man cuz his bitch chose me I fin to pop the trunk
[Bun B] - Runnin' off at they dick suckas gettin' it crunk

[Bun B] - Steady frontin' like a man but you show me a punk
[Pimp C] - Nigga tried to jack my car I had to pop the trunk
[Bun B] - All we really came to do is just smoke some skunk
[Pimp C] - Smokin' at the tittie bar I had to pop the trunk

[Bun B]
Under Cali's blue skies, smokin' on chronicles and chocolate ties
Even when we tell the truth the hoes we lies
Man ain't no disguise, doin' ninety week flies
Ain't got no time for middle men and small fries
Only money conversation and big thighs
Let me talk to your boss man, the nigga wit the pies
And back yo ass up and don't act so surprised
When pistols start to cock, hands start to rise
Nobody move too fast I advise
Or you can catch a hot one right between ya eyes
Recognize I done set me sights on the prize
And put lights out with boom biddy bye, bye's
I'm livin' my life off of rap and weed highs
And act my age but not my fuckin' shoe size
But fuckin' wit us ain't wise
We get crunk, we came to pop the trunk
What, the trunk

[Bun B] - These niggas keep talkin' like they want the funk
[Pimp C] - I knew he was the police I had to pop the trunk
[Bun B] - Runnin' off at they dick suckas gettin' it crunk
[Pimp C] - Man I'm sippin' on [?] poppin' the trunk
[Bun B] - Steady frontin' like a man but you show me a punk
[Pimp C] - [?][?][?] I had to pop the trunk
[Bun B] - All we really came to do is just smoke some skunk
[Pimp C] - To make it, make it crunk I had to pop the trunk

[Pimp C]

Representin money, like Too $hort bitch
Huh[x 4]
Eye for an eye [eye for an eye]
Ride or you die [ride or you die]

[Celly Cel]
Won't leave the house unless I'm strapped up
I might get backed up in the traffic
Niggas is dumping on me when I got my zapper
Creeping up on me
And I got one hand on the wheel
One hand on the steel
Trying to break a nigga for skrill
And I'm ridin' wit sharp shootin' skills
Funk season, whatever the reason
I'm dealing wit drama
Send me one of them mangie ass niggas
Runnin' home, cryin' to Mama
So I kick the door to eliminate the whole situation
Fuckin' wit me me will ended up
Having his family eraseded
Face it, no charges leaving the body behind until
You better respect game
Bow down when real niggas bail through yo hood
But won't be caught up in a twist
Flash on us unless you end up sleeping wit the fish
Seamin' shoes, lady singing the blues, them sad ballads
Fried chicken, collad greens, and potato salads
Surrounded them by [?] of family members cryin'
Eye for an eye' you ride or you die

[Chorus] x 4
Eye for an eye
You ride or you die ride or you die
Niggas get at cha and run back at them
But let them bullets fly

[C-Bo]
He got the Mac One-O
And moved nice on the piggies
Hit 'em up and buck
And leave them struck when I'm tipsy
Ain't no love for the true thugs
That die for this shit
Wit 150 round drum ride for this shit
Fuck the hard hats end locs, pass the fo fo
And watch me smoke them hoes
Like the last hit of indo, and fo' sho
I smash and blast, nigga, when I'm provoked
With a doe of platinum coke
I holds down a fort

[Celly Cel]
Why you smiling for
These niggas playing games on the street
That's where they meet the heat
They sweep they ass up off of they feet
This ain't no fairy tale
You fuckin' with Cel
Hit the scenes wit machines
If you want my team
It ain't no in between
Seventeen through your temple
When your crossing the realest niggas
To spit this killa shit on the mic
And make the world feel us
Hit 'em wit rounds [?]
[?] of hollows then we follow
Niggas to they spine
And chop they ass up
Wit fully-auto's

[Chorus] x 4

[C-Bo]
I ain't no actor bitch
My life is worser than the movies
For real though, from steel toes to my uzi
Pushin' Impala S.S.'s
Benz, Beamers, to Lamborginis
And chase my strip down wit X.O., Henn, and Remi
Rolex on my wrist
Hundred dollar bill's crisp
I pull the blunt from my lip
Then the 4-5 from my hip and spit
The incredible medical or hard core
The deadliest medacine gas ever set off in a war
Westcoast's the spot
Where we lock our million dollar doors
Survival in hell, packing heat
Ducking from them
I'm just a thug nigga
Step on your street and draw my heat
And then I plug niggas
I be a G from the G.B.C
That's why I mug niggas
Don't flag I just sag and carry a mag
And get off in the snitches asses
And Brotha Lynch, you a bitch for still ridin' with Doc
Screaming out the block
Bitch I'll have you die wit Doc [echoes out]

[Chorus] x 4

*echoes*

Bullets flyWhat U Niggas Thought
Gots some Bill like bitches on the under
Tryin to keep it on the slunder cuz I made you wonder
If I was down cuz I rap, now what that mean?
I'm bouts to raise up out the hood & leave my 17
Shot Glock on the block like I want peace
The only peace I'm gon' get is when I'm deceased
(So you still punkin) Yeah if I got to
Trigger finger itchin & I just might pop you
Glock to a muthafuckin head in the 9-5
(Oh, so you gon' buck 'em down just so you can stay alive)
I thought you knew, but these fools keep crossin me
And I be feelin' like the devil got lost in me
When I flash
(So nigga you a killa)
Mamas & babies, they say I'm crazy cuz I give a
Nigga one chance not to fuck wit me
Cuz when you fuck wit me, I gots to take your whole family
(Man you sick) Naw, I ain't got shit to lose
It ain't no rules, I been locked up in county blues
All they can do is send me to the pen with a lunch
To get my ?
And walk the yard with my folks
I'm gettin smoked
But the judge give me 25
When I get caught, I'mma blast
What U Niggas Thought

[Kevin] (Celly)
1 - Bring the chalk (Bring the chalk)
Scrape the bodies off the asphalt
(Scrape the bodies off the muthafuckin asphalt)
It's on when you're in my zone
What U niggas thought (What U niggas thought)

Repeat 1

[Celly]
(Man, you nationwide, why you still kickin' it?)
Cuz niner ross got a 30 round clip in it
And we can take 10 paces then draw
'Fore you turn around, I take 2 & blow off your jaw
Ain't nothin fair in the hood
I dare a nigga to stare at the barrel of my hair pin trigga & square up
Watch his body flare up like some ?
Heart pumpin' Kool-Aid
Now he's sweet as sugar kane
(I thought you was quiet but now I see you in the violence)
Killas don't talk, real niggas move in silence
And I'mma silently creep up on these niggas slowly
And split the funeral money, ???
Homie don't ya know me?
I'm that nigga wit the weapons
Y'all can have them hoes, I'm thinkin fuck the Smith & Wessons
Just feel my nuts and get to splittin half a bloody bath
Is what you get for crossin my path as I bail & laugh
(Niggas like you get smoked everyday)
I'm one of the walkin dead any-muthafuckin-way
(I don't even trip when them fools be muggin me)
They wanna see the thug in me, dead with a slug in me
It's do or die, slip, creep or be crept on
Makin 'em swallow 32 hollow tips when the swept on
Rollin wit they heater
If fools get smoked, it ain't my fault
Plottin & catchin a mutha-fucka slippin
What U Niggas Thought

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Celly]
(What they be thinkin when they see you creepin through the streets?)
They wanna split me, but they know I'm boxin wit my heat
And under my seat, it's in my lap, I got it cocked back
Whatever the destination, can't be loose
Cuz they be peelin' caps
(Yeah, I feel you) Naw, I don't even feel myself
So quick to blast, I can't get smoked unless I kill myself
(Damn) I lost my mind when I bought my nine
Fill it up with a thirty round clip
Like thallon tips all on your blind
Say throwin them thangs
So fool, put your hands down
Bailin through your hood, then catch you slippin wit your pants down
Cuz when you slip, you're put to sleep, it ain't no wakin up
I got these Betty Crocker ass niggas cakin up
Peakin out the window, smoked like indo
Smoked like ?
The shit that get you stuck when you see me raisin up outta the bush
(So you be creepin on the late night, right)
Naw, the best way to kill a nigga is in broad daylight
(Like dat) I thought you knew me but you went soft
Now it's 'bout time I cut your mutha-fuckin water off
Stompin in my steel-toes, bailin wit my H.I. double L. west niggas
Puttin y'all to rest niggas
Bring the chalk, scrape the bodies off the asphalt
It's on when you in my zone
What U Niggas Thought

Repeat 1
Repeat 1[Celly Cel]
Man, it's like...
Everytime I leave the house
I stop and I ask myself
Am I leavin' for the last time??
Cause ain't no tellin' what's gon' happen
Out here while I'm runnin' these streets
You know what I'm sayin'?
Anything can happen nigga
You gotta watch everything around you
You can't trust nothin' out here

Another day I get to live to see some more of this
Drama in the street is so deep, don't even know if it's
Gon' be me at the end of somebody barrel smokin'
Cause I'm loc'n they point the finger and say I'm provokin'
The situation by speakin' the real to killin' fields
And penitentiary steel is what I see for real
It's raw deals that we gettin' in the system mayne
Givin' up no love, once you caught up they pullin' rank
County or the pen, you know we can't win
So we mobs with that ghetto grin tryin' to make them ends
Stack on the track with sticky greens and cognac
Always watch your back and never let 'em know you strapped
Ain't no such thing as a sucka no more
Cause anybody with some heat will lay you down on the floor
Friends turn to foes, tags on they toes
When will it be your time to go? You never know

[Hook] - X 2
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know

[Celly Cel]
Used to be the enemy dumpin' on my bucket
Now I'm havin' static with these fools that I grew up with
Never thought the hood would turn against the hood
When they think you doin' good the hood don't stick together like it should
Wastin' time tryin' to count another players chips
Loose lips will make you walk the plank on my ship
I've seen 'em get smothered for less, lost in the land of stress
It's sad to see homies get put to rest, then I guess
It's the same when you funkin' and freeze one of your enemies
Another funeral, a mother cryin' on her knees
It's a war zone, here today tomorrow you gone
In to win, ain't no friends, go for somethin' it's on
Can't get caught slippin' or crossed up by them faulty
Women out there slippin' mickeys ain't gon' come up off me
Who can I trust, who gon' be there when we kickin' dust?
Or when they bust, I'll ride with who ride with us

[Hook] - X 2
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know

[Celly Cel]
Gotta stay on your toes, don't know who plottin' on your click
And jealousy will make your closest homies wanna split
Your wig and dig a ditch for you cause you out there gettin' paid
Had the same trey, posted on the same block in May
Scrill they can't fade, you was real about chasin' paper
They was talkin' about them broads first and get the money later
A faulty misses, stay focused and make your own decisions
Stay in your jurisdiction, keep that scrill in your vision
Watch your backside, they ride when they ain't got no hustle
And keep your heat so fools like Debo can't even muscle
You out your coins and don't let no new recruits join
And she can holla if she headed for the tenderloin
Then strip to add some Ben Franklin's to my bundle
I ain't mad if she gon' add some crab to the gumbo
And keep it crackin', don't know what's gon' happen when I play this game
So I pray, I live to see another day

[Hook] - X 4
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know
Sometimes I get to thinkin' when I step out the door
Is it my time to go? Runnin' the streets you never know(E-40)

(Celly Cel)
Beware of those faulty ass mark ass niggas snakin' in tha grass
Tryin' to take your cash cause you bubbled up to fast, the last
Nigga that tried to go against the grain, I made him feel me, mane
Cocked the Glock, put on in the chamber then I aimed
For his dome and split him like a Garcia
Vega down the middle, jumped in my car, see ya
Itchy trigger finger dumpin' on them dont-knows
Janky ass motherfuckers, mane, beware of those
(JT The Bigga Figga)
We drop bombs wit stocks and bonds and make it rappable
Financial status increasing cause everyday it's capital
But more than likely, they sure ain't real because they plastic
No money in they pockets but G-notes worth of assets
I reach out then drop check watch and get my proppers
We kicks it wit killers who hate cops and pack they choppers
So when you see me it ain't nou need for perpetratin'
Stay the fuck up out my face because I know you playa hatin' me
(E-40)
Yeah, I still be my young Frisco city comrade
Makin' these niggas midnabb
Postin' up in tha lidnabb
Pilin' up that cidnash
Champagne wishes, pussy fallin' up out the pockets
Thick ass ... surrounded by docters, chocolate ...
The niggas that you be thinkin' that's always out to getcha
Ain't always tryin' out to getcha
Sometimes them real niggas that be witcha that's out to getcha
That's why me keeps my tossed pistolas on the side of me waist-a
Just in case these cape crusaders wanna erase me

(E-40)
Hey, like I was saying look he, JT
Yuo from Frisco, we from the V right
We from the labb, we networking, this is what we do
And if you ain't got tha recipe
Don't be mad if they ain't checkin' for ya
(JT The Bigga Figga)
That's real!

(Celly Cell)
I see you sittin' on them thangs and bending the block
You better be sittin' on a Glock or you'll be riding stock
The jackers see them niggas clown, just like I see them niggas
But don't be slippin' when you see me, I might be them niggas
With the choppers yellin' get out the car nigga
Hit the gas and watch me blast you ain't gone get to far nigga
Don't trust nobody cause your closest friends will turn to foes
It's double agence in this game, I know you feel me though
(E-40)
You wanna take your potnas win, from me tell my why
Man y'all was potnas tryin' together nigga knee-high
How's the fuck you just gone transport my ... wear
Over some he say she say shit man dude you out there
(JT The Bigga Figga)
Approaching my status feeling flavor never saving hoes
Breakin' doors try to trickin' some niggas in candy painted vogues
Marinatin' wit my boys from the V
We gets our paper stacks our chips and than we strike on z's
We wraps our ki's tight to keeps our G's right
Gotta get that money so we can be upon the next flight
Not a dab but a smidgen play my game on precision
We dropped the bomb that'll make things come
Then they fly like some pigeons
It's goin' down, but ain't no need for extra talkin'
How many straps up in the house, you best to get to walkin'
Cause in the '95 these niggas go for broke
Get up off that kamikaze in you face and end of smoke
Beware of those

(E-40)
Hey, this is my philosophy right here
I feel it's enough cornbread out here for everbody

You know what I'm saying, I mean just think about it
I'm mean we, it's a gang of motherfuckers out there
And we tryin' to change this shit, this the new dope game
We gone all get up in this rap shit
And get our coins ridnow as we speak, get them tokens you dig?
(JT The Bigga Figga)
Tokens, yeah
(E-40)
You know, we networking like I say
Cel, what's happening wit you playboy we, you dig
You laid that serious shit down
And you came from the heart
We all came from the heart and this is what we did
And you know, fuck it you know we
I'm in this motherfucker and you know how I do
I'm off some motherfuckin' shit
Urkin' jerk wit some motherfuckin' snapple
This 40-water, you know, like that
This is what we do[E-40]
Uhh, dry as the fuck, and I'm (?) one left with yo-yo
Seven houses down, black street, dark (?) folk don't matter tho'
I don't know who to trust, what to look fo'
How many niggas wanna kill me?
I'm havin a, hard time tryin to determine
If that's the homey, or the enemy
Ol' shady-ass, no build for that
Just lookin like he plottin on somethin-ass nigga
But I wanted to mack like he fin' to do somethin
And I'll get to be dumpin on yo' ass nigga
One of the main rules, of the game, without a doubt
Nigga don't you ever pull a gun and don't use it
Nigga that's a good way to get your brains blow out
Motherfucker like me get to flashin then I lose it
Leave that ol' shit up to me and watch me prove it
Nigga, you betta be real about this shit
If you in it you in it don't be no punk
Nigga this ain't no baseball game, niggas don't FORFEIT NO DAMN FUNK

[T-Pup]
Two brothers goin sack for sack
In the back of the 'llac, takin a whiffle
Strippin the fuck up out of some willow
Poppin ecstasy like Skittles
It'll get you in the long run, sniffin them long ones
Way girl burst ya dick and now it got ya on one
Came up shorted, circumstances nigga quote it
What goes around comes around tryin to steal this (?) Brady hostess
Keep your focus, and never the love of the hocus pocus
Set up hoes lovin to get jackers to come and smoke us
Die-hard soldier, T-Pup-alicious, cops get vicious
No mercy on haters or no bitches
Got in my clitches waitin for a nigga to take some chances
So we can deal with these hardco' Sic-Wid-It-ass circumstances

Chorus: various singers together

Takin all these CHANCES
You might never ever ever get them CIRCUMSTANCES
Penitentiary CHANCES
You might never ever ever get them CIRCUMSTANCES

Chorus Two: Cold 187um, Kokane + more (repeat 2X)

I said the world is full of crack babies
I remember when the world went crazy
Til I copped a sack, and put it down like that
And rolled out like it didn't even fade me

[Yukmouth]
Nigga - slang suga delight enough to get my hustle right
It's double like, a flip new Benzo with the bubble lights
Scuffle fights with rats and roaches, I was the brokest
Motherfucker, now I'm the closest nigga to ballin ferocious
Motherfucker, dust a nigga off like wax off, cracks off a hard
(Fo' sheezy) Pimpin ain't easy and motherfucker only if you breezy
Easy does it, I does it do it off the fluid
Come with the newest shit I come through with
Bitch don't you hear the music?
(Don't you hear the music? Too sexy for my shirt)
Too sexy for my shirt so bad hurt
Niggas on the turf wanna put my ass up in the dirt, cause I skirt
A Lex-o and slurp a genie bottle full of X-O
Or maybe cause I'm with 40-Water and a jug of ethel
You can't love it, don't leave the ghetto
Me and I'm heated like two jugs of methyl

[Numskull]
Damn, (??)cydal shit when vital shit starts to happen
Eager to be the nigga just for cappin
Strappin up ain't no thang, it's survival
It's makin sure you all good when it comes to enemies and rivals
It's +Higher Learning+, but it's +True Lies+
When it comes to the +Superfly+
Speedy Gonzalez destroyes from the Eastside
Is it ridicule or stardom? Did we hurt yo' feelings, pardon
I'm makin niggas fall like cops on +Rage in Harlem+
(Beotch!) I'm on some moonshine shit
Bit the cork off the Cristal
I'm drunk so let me chill for a while

Chorus
Chorus Two

[Celly Cel]
Aww yeah yeah now niggas know
Well ain't no sense in me fuckin around
My stompin ground be the H-I-double-L-S-I-D-E bound
To touch you with them tecs and make them marks, bounce like checks
Slide a faulty bitch up under these niggas
And killin 'em off with sex
Ain't no tellin what angle I'm comin with these circumstances
Penitentiary chances, nina ruff fluffin tap dancers
On your hood for breedin snitch bitch-made niggas
Don't fade triggers so they quick get sprayed niggas
I fuck with wig-splitters, Colombian neck-tie throat slitters
(??) take a long time business to get paid
To get rid of you cheater
Chatter police-ass niggas takin chances (takin chances)
Man you can't fuck with these circumstances

[E-40]
And all you O.G. motherfuckers better stop tryin to mark them yungsta
Cause sooner or later, they gon' dump, like some garbage dusters
Tryin to throw yo' weight around
Like you gon', uhh, take over a spot
Nigga don't you know these youngsters nowadays
Be off that water and hot?

Chorus
Chorus Two[Celly Cel]
What's up for today, I'm tryin' to kick it, know the homie wit it
Soup up my dog, we hittin' corners, gettin' seven digits
Cuz they come out when the sun out, it's on again
I make 'em grin when they see the chrome rim spin
Twenty inch, don't know I'm stingy like the Grinch
I penny-pinch, let them play once and sit the bench
It's a cinch, to pull 'em out of the season
If she choose me, don't let that broad be the reason
Smash off and leave a cloud, music bump loud
Ride through the park and let them fifteens move the crowd
Pop out and bail through somebody barbeque
Make a play, drink a brew, see what I can run through
And half naked in the summer, I'm collecting numbers
I tell 'em keep it on the under, waiting for the sun up
Go down so I can clown, late-night creeping
That's how we kick it, every day is tha weekend

[Otis & Shug] (Celly Cel)
We came to smoke (Yeah)
Light one bitch or foe (Uh huh)
Sippin' on some Henn (Uh)
Cuz it's on again (It's on again)
We came to choke (That's right)
Light one bitch or foe (Uh huh)
Sippin' on some Gin
Cuz every day is tha weekend

[Celly Cel]
Slide by the store, pull out them big faces
We livin' today, we gettin' drank by the case
Leavin' traces of burnt rubber on the floor
Everywhere we go, we light it up like the side show
I'm sittin' on the door hangin' out the vehicle
It's Breezy in the store, yellin' "Celly, where you feel to go?"
Straight-lacin', pervin' until I'm on my face and
No destination, follow me, I got the population
To get yo' go, it's on when we hit the scene
I know you feign for them sticky, mean collard greens
Blowin' zips, chasin' chips, watchin' money flip
Trade more stories, reminiscin' wit' my click
Takin' flicks, never know when the party over
Every summer, it seem like I lose another soldier
Even ones havin' fun gotta watch yo' back
They still creepin, every day is tha weekend

[Otis & Shug] (Celly Cel)
We came to smoke (You know)
Light one bitch or foe (Uh huh)
Sippin' on some Henn (Yeah right)
Cuz it's on again (It's on again)
We came to choke (Uh huh)
Light one bitch or foe (Light somethin')
Sippin' on some Gin (Yeah)
Cuz every day is tha weekend

[Celly Cel]
We sittin' on chrome, gold thangs and hubs
We get the party started when we step in the clubs
You can mug, but don't underestimate these thugs
You can holla at a playa, I got nuttin' but love
"There they go." That's what they say when we hit the floor
Get our groove on fo' sho', you know, that's how it go
Got tennis shoes on and I'm still gettin' in
See me at the bar, reelin' 'em in, I'm tryin' to win
Seen this notch with this tight dress on filin'
She kept smilin', sippin' on Long Islands
They was zealous, I love it when a woman choose
And when she hear this conversation, I can't lose
It don't stop, late night, still on the town
Slide by the after hours spot and put it down
That's how we do it, got the bomb and the fluid
The homies bringin' the freaks and every day is tha weekend

[Otis & Shug] (Celly Cel)
We came to smoke (You know)
Light one bitch or foe (Light somethin')
Sippin' on some Henn (Uh huh)
Cuz it's on again (It's on again)
We came to choke (That's what we came fo')
Light one bitch or foe (You know)
Sippin' on some Gin (That's what we do)
Cuz every day is tha weekend

We came to smoke (Who gon' smoke? Who wanna date tonight?)
Light one bitch or foe (Who got the Hennesey? Who gon' drink tonight?)
Sippin' on some Henn (Who gon' smoke? Who wanna date tonight?)
Cuz it's on again (Who got the Hennesey? Who gon' drink tonight?)
We came to choke (Who gon' choke? Who wanna date tonight?)
Light one bitch or foe (Who got the Gin? Who gon' drink tonight?)

They got no time to be trippin' on niggas
That's tryin' to keep me down
I put that bump in your trunk and lace the nation's underground
Let them know about the ghetto mentality
Niggas get smoked for nothing at all
They want you up out of the game
When they see you get on your feet and ball
Faulty niggas never run me off my cellar lot, I always kick it
I ain't never had it
I wanna see every black man in the world with a meal ticket
Eatin' steak and lobster, crackin' crab, sippin' Don P 'til they hurl
But in the meantime speakin' for all my niggas
Fuck tha world!

[Silkk]
Man, I just touched down, me and Celly conversate on some plan
Until we got lip on the bud, 'fore this shit get up outta hand
Fuck niggas hatin', fuck a nigga lovin', I deal with it

What's up with it man?
You got a problem with the way I'm doin' my thang?
I lets my nuts hang then put these niggas the flash to go insane
Oh, that be me, let's kick it; just don't pull your tech late
We ride up on you and catch you slippin', checkmate!
Lie down and best watch out everything, nowadays you can't trust
Now one of these niggas, they coulda been paid to put a head out on us
You understandin' me like I say
"Keep it in the family, man, you can't miss"
Eliminate them haters and yo' mix, fuck tha world and feel bitch!

[Silkk]
Be about your money, nigga, all about your scratch
Everyday I gotta plot and make it
'til I'm on top to make my dollars and stats
On the real, we big time fuckin' ballers
Niggas, shot callers, lay in 'em drop tops, gold thangs and M-40's
Well you gotta have big paper, nigga, just to fuckin' kick it
Ain't no bitches in the streets, nigga, this motherfucker get wicked
See, a multi-pep nigga, but I be TRU to this shit
First of all, about my money, fuck a bitch
I'm tryin' to get rich! Ugh!

Repeat 1

[Celly Cel]
Crept from the bottom, man, I struggled all my motherfucking life
Use to have a razor blade, sliced through solid A1, wide knots
The only way to get some scrilla;
If you knockin,' then fuck what you talkin'
Broke ass nigga everybody in the hood own thangs, and you walkin'
You the same type of niggas that hate on everything that a playa do
Always talkin' about "I woulda done this, I woulda done that" Fuck you!
Wark ass nigga, don't wanna see they don't get nothing
Don't wanna give me no props
Smile on your face; when you post-up, stab you in the back
When you need a bluff

[Silkk]
Well, fuck 'em! Cuz, see, we be all about our payday
]From South to the West, bitch, we connect, bitch
We wreck this like an AK
Or get bang like some hoes or get hang like some clothes
When I be get done I'ma slap you like some motherfucking doe
But if only you blow, nigga, red like some rose
I yell your whole click outpick you bitch
You like some motherfucking F O

And leave them hollow thangs in your body

Gets dick hard drunk

And you don't wanna dance tingo tango
I let my left right mingle mangle
To your jaw southpaw
It oughta be a law against these thangs I throw
About to lay some shit down with Celly Cel and Bo
From the Garden Blocc
Hillside got they Glock
Mack 10's
Mobb shit'll neva end
I'm tryin' to have it all
So I ball 'till I'm gold
Mobbin' through a sixty usin' cruise control

C-Bo:
I'm fuckin' wit that click nigga
That big nigga on the block
With Glocks, Rag Tops
Cut thangs on them gold knocks
Better watch your back 'cuz we strapped with teks
Push up in a blue Lex'
And dump caps to your neck
Mobb shit

Leather trench
Brim and two nines

And you can't fuck wit these
Get smothered with a half a key
Bitch

Celly Cel:
Give me the ball and I'mma fill the lane like 'Fenney
Hardaway 'cuz I'm out to get every penny
Any nigga disrespectin' when I'm checkin' for my scrilla
I know'm stilla wig splittin' killa ain't no realla
Nigga realla than me
Mobbin' through your hood and takin' heads
Slumpin' hangin out the windows dumpin'
And shakin' 'Feds
So mind your own
Cross the line and see how quick they gone
Head blown decapitated caught slippin' in my zone

Fuckin' with this Mobb shit
Niggas get they wig split

C-Bo:
Uggh it's the murder man posted at the front door
And when they comes I dumps with both four-four's
Letin' 'em have it 'cuz I'm static
Dumpin the grass
Killed his ass
And then kneel down and get my last laugh
Punk bitch shouldn't have tripped
Now he lay dead in the ditch
Ass ripped
Suckin' on his own dick
Money talk
Bullshit walk
Fool this ain't no sunshine
Three killas
One garden blocc, two hillside

B-Legit:
This shit's fucked and I am tag teamin' with the murder man
And that'll hurt a man
Niggas doin' dirt and
All you got to do is hop your ass in my 'Cut
We'll be back tomorrow mornin'
Cell, you comin' or what?
I got this gut feelin'
About to make the killin' for a livin'
The contract said the nigga wore a wire tap
And they want him dead
A hundred G's for his head
And leave a bloody glove down where that body bled

Celly Cel:
Red rum is what I'm hummin' as I hit the fence
Homicide looked for prints but found no evidence
Stuffed his head in the duffel bag and zipped it up
Them ballas want to see his face before they break us off a cut
There it is cashed him like some chips at Reno
Slid us a briefcase full of crispy ass C-Notes
Made the hit
Got the scrilla
Gone without a trace
B behind the wheel
And Bo Loc cuffed to the briefcase
Yo' nigga Cell got the chopper 'case they on my trail
If it's a tail then I'mma leave a 50 empty shells
Pistol smokin'
These niggas know we ain't no jokin'
Split up the tokens
And I'm back in the hood loccin'

Fuckin' with this Mobb shit
Niggas get they wig split

B-Legit:
Yeah, like a real hillside strangler, yola slanger, tryin to get a
Buck but if I'm fucked in the gas chamber
The autopsy red, them niggas had some heat fo yo ass
And never leave your block without your Glock, clip and mask
Haters hatin but its all game related and that's what we do bitchReadin' Pimp
Playa-istic shit
By dino boys
Tryin' to get these hoes for every nook & cranny
And make 'em join
The winning team
Ain't nothin' but realness
I know they feel this
Ain't nothin' but sponges
Waitin' for me to leak or slip & spill this
Game I got at an early age by watchin' all the G's
Rat heads get nothin' but cheese
And drop down on they knees wit ease
I make 'em blow me
Then I tell that ho to blow my homie
Ho, don't ya know me?
When you say you love me, I make you show me
If you ain't never sucked no dick, you best recognize
Don't be surprised when you see my nut
Splashin' between your eyes
Don't even know these hoes
They come up out they clothes for me
Feelin' like a camera man on spikes
When they pose for me
I watch 'em rise
Slappin' that ass like they was in the Kentucky... Derby
Bouncin' on my dick
Cuz these hoes love to fuck me
I don't get sprung

Cuz they lost they heart in the game
All up under these bitches
Treatin' these hookers like they top-notch
Breakin' off your scrilla
Like you are da only nigga that's hittin' the cock
But when you slip & sleep
At 4 in the mornin', somebody's swoopin'
Up your broad, you might be faithful but your bitch is shoopin'
Shoop be doop
Yeah, now you feel a nigga though
You better feel that ho before you flash & try to kill that ho
Mark ass niggas think they got it sewed up
Lockin' bitches up
Cock blockin' & they still get fucked
Niggas get mad & wanna flash when they hear they ho is loose
Smilin' in my face & wanna blast on that gin & juice
Boostin' up your courage
Now you trippin' cuz your bitch was foul

Don't need no gold ones to make 'em creep
Don't know how to catch a ho
Ask niggas, love to dirty mack
Tellin' yo' business to bitches
Playin' a role like you ain't up under that ass
Pass you in the streets
Pick up they mobile & call yo' bitch
Askin' "where dat nigga at?"
Then turn around & dry snitch
I seen you the other day
With a bitch in a low, tryin' to stop my lounge
But these is he niggas that went from a nothing
I can't understand why they wanna knock my lounge

You got to let that shit go
Don't fuck around wit niggas

I breaks em off a taste of that Ciggety Cel and Spice..

Spice 1:

Gettin' it on like Marvin Gaye, I'll meet you by the motherfuckin dock of the
East Bay [blew]
Kill em off like this, ba-da-ba-ba-ba-bye
Them slugs couldn't spill me, them niggas shoulda killed me..
Now I wanna know who they are
When I put some slugs in them niggas kill em off in they car..

Celly Cel:

You see, they can't fuck around with niggas whos so quick to blast
So quick to put these slugs up in your ass
They be a hundred miles and runnin when they see me comin
Bringin more funk than the pussy on a yeast infected woman
So kick the flow
You see a nigga stompin with that 'H' on my back
Choppin these fools in half with my Mack

Spice 1:

Mass motherfuckin murder they ain't breathin'
That niggas wheezin
Hot slugs got him freezin'
Coughin and he's soundin like he got a cold
But hes chokin off that Redrum, whole fuckin body numb..

~Chorus~:

Retalliation is a must where im from..

Repeat Chorus

Spice 1

[Blaaaw]
Murder in the first and shit
Beat a nigga dead body with the pistol grip, playa..
Sp-Spice 1 often shoots, kickin knocked out niggas in the head with boots
I got my motha fuckin choppa, pop a cap, in your ass cause you can't stop a
Psychopathic motherfuckin nut
Snatch all your fuckin guts
Leave your ass in a ditch all opened up..
Kickin' the tales of the niggas who got crept on
Blow out his fuckin brains, cause i was slept on..

Celly Cel:

Now I'm posted with a chopper in my coat full of Hennesey
Fixin' to let my 40 spit out thirty-two when I see
These niggas that wanna test a playa swingin' from my nuts
Pull my mighty Mack and let the street sweeper sweep him up..
The only thing I leave behind is casings on the ground
Lookin for the snitches on the block so I can buck em down..
I gets my Clown with every round that I let fly
Trigger happy niggy in the hood, die nigga die
Funk for life, when they smoke me that's when I'm done
So take a sip of this Red motherfuckin' Rum....

~Chorus(2x)~

Celly Cel:

Call me the Undertaker, call me the casket closer
Fillin niggas up with lead like they fill Shwisher's up with doja
At the graveyard countin' the bodies I left in the mud
I break em off, ain't nothin but buckin' till they spittin blood
But niggas dont feel me
They wanna kill me but these fools dont know me
I rolls them like a blunt, fill em with slugs and bury them slowly
Infrared beam gleam, he's dead on the scene
Shot in the spleen
Got two in the chest he's off the scene
Its C-Celly Cel and Spice 1 sp-splittin wigs
Its murderin' so some of that Redrum come take a swig
[Blaaaw]

Spice 1:

These motherfuckin nuts if you wanna murder me
Harder to kill than your average motherfuckin 'G'
Put a cap up in that ass
Nigga with a gat thats quick to blast
Raisin up outta the funkwith a chrome four four and a black ski mask
Killin for the cash, mobbin' that ass
When so many of these gang buckshots shatter my glass
Mashed on the block and I kept on bustin'
Gotta let them know I'm not no Midnarc
Put it up in Piznark
And let my A.K. Biznark
Beitchh!
Killin off niggas in the diznark
You ever seen what a bullet can do to flesh
Just call me Messy Marvin, leaves a mess...

~Chorus(4x)~(feat. C-Bo)

[x4]
Eye for an eye [eye for an eye]
Ride or you die [ride or you die]

[Celly Cel]
Won't leave the house unless I'm strapped up
I might get backed up in the traffic
Niggas is dumping on me when I got my zapper
Creeping up on me
And I got one hand on the wheel
One hand on the steel
Trying to break a nigga for skrill
And I'm ridin' wit sharp shootin' skills
Funk season, whatever the reason
I'm dealing wit drama
Send me one of them mangie ass niggas
Runnin' home, cryin' to Mama
So I kick the door to eliminate the whole situation
Fuckin' wit me me will ended up
Having his family eraseded
Face it, no charges leaving the body behind until
You better respect game
Bow down when real niggas bail through yo hood
But won't be caught up in a twist
Flash on us unless you end up sleeping wit the fish
Seamin' shoes, lady singing the blues, them sad ballads
Fried chicken, collad greens, and potato salads
Surrounded them by [?] of family members cryin'
Eye for an eye' you ride or you die

[Chorus x4]
Eye for an eye
You ride or you die ride or you die
Niggas get at cha and run back at them
But let them bullets fly

[C-Bo]
He got the Mac One-O
And moved nice on the piggies
Hit 'em up and buck
And leave them struck when I'm tipsy
Ain't no love for the true thugs
That die for this shit
Wit 150 round drum ride for this shit
Fuck the hard hats end locs, pass the fo fo
And watch me smoke them hoes
Like the last hit of indo, and fo' sho
I smash and blast, nigga, when I'm provoked
With a doe of platinum coke
I holds down a fort

[Celly Cel]
Why you smiling for
These niggas playing games on the street
That's where they meet the heat
They sweep they ass up off of they feet
This ain't no fairy tale
You fuckin' with Cel
Hit the scenes wit machines
If you want my team
It ain't no in between
Seventeen through your temple
When your crossing the realest niggas
To spit this killa shit on the mic
And make the world feel us
Hit 'em wit rounds [?]
[?] of hollows then we follow
Niggas to they spine
And chop they ass up
Wit fully-auto's

[Chorus x4]
[C-Bo]
I ain't no actor bitch
My life is worser than the movies
For real though, from steel toes to my uzi
Pushin' Impala S.S.'s
Benz, Beamers, to Lamborginis
And chase my strip down wit X.O., Henn, and Remi
Rolex on my wrist
Hundred dollar bill's crisp
I pull the blunt from my lip
Then the 4-5 from my hip and spit
The incredible medical or hard core
The deadliest medacine gas ever set off in a war
Westcoast's the spot
Where we lock our million dollar doors
Survival in hell, packing heat
Ducking from them
I'm just a thug nigga
Step on your street and draw my heat
And then I plug niggas
I be a G from the G.B.C
That's why I mug niggas
Don't flag I just sag and carry a mag
And get off in the snitches asses
You a bitch but still ride or die
Screaming out the block
Bitch I'll have you die wit doc [echoes out]

[Chorus x4]
[echoes]

Bullets fly
