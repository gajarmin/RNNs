(Swizz Beatz)
Double R
Right Now
We ain't playin' wit y'all
We ain't playin' wit y'all
Stop playin' Drag

(Verse 1)-Drag-On
A-yo I spit these bars to make ya head shake
Fuck bitches 'til the bed break
Let's see how much lead you can take
Never let a nigga pay for what I give away
We can all share
Clip to my waist it's all spare
So run dammit, run
When I bust my gun
I miss none
Put y'all in critical condition
I'm the talk of the town when it comes to fuckin' bitches
Or layin' niggas down
Drag bust the most rounds
While y'all niggas dibble and dabble
The shit I pull up wit
It'll feel like it grabs you
We ain't fuckin' I had you
Shit I know Drag'll be glad to
If I had to
Soon as she in the bathroom
I'm in her ass too
Gotta six shot shooter
That'll pop thru ya
Glock ruger
In case I call my block movers
State troopers on my ass
Shit let me see them touch 160 on the dash
My Z look pretty when it's fast
I bet 50 I'mma juice the city before I pass
And if you wanna catch fire better step on the gas
The opposite of H2O
Wanna be a hero
When the fires on
Y'all won't even save ya moms
Even if she was screamin' at the top of her lungs
Niggas either burn to the bone or leave the shit alone
In case of a fire never take the elevator
Walk 2 flights hold ya breath and take the steps (Uhh)

(Hook)-Swizz Beats
Do my ladies run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my ballers run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my mamis run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my dogs run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh

(Verse 2)-Drag-On
A-yo I only fuck bitches that's flexible
Ankle touch neck sex incredible
When Drag about to spark cats
Ain't no bargin wit that
When my gun spit it say "Where The Target At?"
Cuz I'm fire so I speaks wit heat
So let me walk that walk
Cuz like a teacher I'mma talk wit chalk
That'll outline y'all like a fresh pair of Nikes
Stay wit those
Even if I'm bare toed you see the stripe
I leave blood stains on sponges
Cum stains on comforters
I leave rooms foggy
'Til where y'all can't find me
Keep a bad mami
Twisting up the green scent
Like tangerine face out of a magazine
Like ebony
On the block I pump the ivory
Never pay for show
I only fuck wit those that never ate before
That means no food, no cars and just skip bail
The only thing on they plate is no more than fish scale
The blow you only know about is the air outside
I have nightmares before I sleep I pray y'all fry
For a pie I lay out guys
Cuz what I keeps layin' on my dresser
Keeps layin' niggas on top of stretchers
Lightweight but I give off pressure in all measures
Never chase treasures
Flame niggas for pleasure
Red/Gold vest
Bullets go thru tef
Got better double R
2 letter (Nigga)

(Hook) 2x's
Do my ladies run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my ballers run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my mamis run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh
Do my dogs run this uhh-huh
Yes they do run this mutha-uhh-huh[Hook: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than di knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of di flesh is not di ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and ah wear jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
The body's just a vehicle
Transporting the soul
Its whats inside the people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got
Lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins

[Verse 4: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer
Careful how you entertain stranger
Selassie never born inna nuh manger
I'll never crucify as me savior
Elect off himself inna the ruler
Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure
So be careful of dem cellular and pager
Cause I sign see dem I see danger
So dem great but Selaisse I greater

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Drag-on]
He did mi wanna lick upon shots
Upon a bloodclad
And fill the block with bum rush cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across mi yards And
Before another brother's in chalk And
I 'magine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott free
So police mi gonna pop you b'fore you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars
Storm upon mi prada
Watch a bomb holla
Watch 'im run, hit the floor
Told 'im come, come no
Throw ya ganja pon de air
'plah!'

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Damian Marley]
Watch for sticks and stones
Stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road
Miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul
That always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic
Blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic
And always be aware
The truth is crying out
And it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion
Can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

[Hook][Intro: Swizz Beatz]
This thing right here
Is for my peoples in the streets
And this thing right here
Will get your ass off your feet

[Verse 1: Drag-On]
They call me Drag-On, when it's time to bomb
I burn em all, til they all say turn em off
Cause these chips, I'mma run em all
Chickenheads, know I, be the Colonel
Cause I burn eternal, mixed wit the inferno
So be careful, 'fore I burn you
You better learn dude, yeah I heard you
But I'mma hurt you, but you don't know?
My versatile, is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which means
A lot cream, lot of schemes
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough
Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust? Cause we do
You need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently
Is you buying this?
Cause niggas that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag-On; I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkers
But this Bronx bombers spittin' flame
So you better wear your armor
Flame on!

[Hook x2: DMX]
My dogs gon' stop , your dogs gon' drop
And then we gon' shut 'em down, open up shop
First we had em like "ohhh"
Now they like "nooo!"
What baby?!! That's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my Glock up
You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
If you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
And then give it to a modelin bitch
And you like your watch plain, I'mma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

[Verse 3: Styles]
Y'all niggas ain't hearin me out, til I pop up
Appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin the clip
And the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man?
When I cock back and hop out the van
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, and snatch your R
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge

[Verse 4: Eve]
Guess you figured that my niggas, flippers, pullin triggers
News team crowd around, tryin to flick a picture
Get witcha, this bitch from Illadelph marches quicker
Nigga not makin sense better stay up off the liquor
Blonde bombshell, car-a-mel, heavy spender
Groups be sayin I'm they sister, hush ya mouth 'fore I hit ya
Stickin in wiseguys, fake thugs, and bullshitters
Take you for a ride, cover up your eye, then I get ya
Used to be shy-er, now I'mma Ruff Ryder
Big niggas play me close, when they used to ride by her
Snatchin up your figures, frontin, know you dig us
Haters, screamin, "who that bitch?"
Mind your business nigga

[Hook]

[Interlude: DJ Clue]
Mad shout out, Donnie Brascoe
Big Skate, Duro

[Verse 5: DMX]
The X is gonna hit y'all niggas hard, leave y'all niggas scarred
Fuckin' with the Dog when you fuckin' with the God
Rip y'all niggas off, faggot niggas soft
Remember me from up North, I had you scared to cough
My name is ringin' bells in penitentiary cells
I'm making thugs rebel, ain't hard to tell
You never really wanted it, so the mic you jumped in front of it
Outta sixteen shots I'mma hit, which one of you niggas am I gonna get
Thought you knew what I was gonna spit, this time with this rhyme
But by the end of it, y'all niggas is gon' be like, "Yo X ripped it!"
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop
Them cats can't be for real, I got this shit locked!
Is that a game or a joke? Say the name or get smoked
Simple as that, simple as black, to the throat
Hit em all up to the coat, now you losin your life
A dog is a dog for life![Swizz Beatz]
Keep yo' hands in the air, cause we gon' take you there
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care..
Uh-huh, uh, what

Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me

[DMX]
Uhh, uhh
If I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night
If I'm lookin for somethin it's probably a fight
If I'm goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'mma play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?

Chorus

[Drag-On]
Y'know fuckin wit me, ain't keepin your health right
Cause me and my Rolls, we keep it jail tight
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shell is light
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin anything that I'm puttin my name on
You might take a 'Drag', but you can't flame 'On'
I know y'all niggas to homey, wit a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know who we are
Niggas spittin mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
Cause dog you don't wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (C'MON!)

Chorus

[DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Uhh, uhh
What you niggas want? Cause I got it right here
Y'all niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit - will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On, cause he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all takin over ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no other cats gon' shed blood wit me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me, c'mon!

Chorus

[DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Juvenile, Drag-On (flame on)
And now.. Swizz Swizz Beats, yea!

[Drag-On]
Me and my niggas done licked shots, even done hit cops
Betcha niggas can't wait til my shit drop
Treat you like your momma, give you lip a pop
Nigga you don't want my clip to drop
Cause that means I'm empty, and you're full of it
Check what the bullet did
Missiles gonna hit you get you, rip through tissue
Shoot another rhyme just cause I missed you
I make plus cash, you little niggas can't fuck wit Drag
Got the chain out, so his muscle grabs
Nigga fuck that, you better bust back
'fore ya monkey-ass land where the dust at
Ride like the girl but you can't trust cash
Spit line of fire and he can't touch black
All you can do is cuss back
In your weak raps bout how you bust gats
Nigga we don't need that, I don't care about your feedback
Y'all niggas don't feed Drag
Til a motherfucker pull out, bust a bullet out
In the safe house, nigga where the keys at
Nigga where the stash at, nigga where the weed at
Nigga pass that 'fore I pull my trigger
Matter fact where the ass at, cause I got the "Rough Rider"
And I ain't talkin bout my niggas
Cause nigga we can go ho for ho, toe to toe, blow for blow
And when you feel your nose crack
That mean I broke that, I fill a po'-po' wit a flame thrower
Like I told yo' befo' ya know umm - you can't handle
You can put me on wax but my fire burn candles
And who that nigga Ruff Rydin, Drag-On
Y'all niggas and Southsiders

Chorus: Drag-On + Various (repeat 2X)

Do y'all niggas bust y'all guns?
(Hell yeah we bust our guns!!)
Do y'all fuck them til they cum?
(Damn right we make them cum!!)
It's for the North (HEY) South (HEY)
East (HEY) West (HEY)
Ruff Ryders gonna show y'all niggas who ride the best

[Juvenile]
Hmmmm, hmmmmmmmm
In the late night, we be cockin iron and givin you stage fright
Yo head might explode, when I bust with the lead pipe
Now say it right, Juvenile, Head tight
Stay hype, now page Mike and make sure he got all the yay, aight?
I'm tired of you niggas, be thinkin that you usin me
Runnin with them petty-ass niggas lookin like fools to me
I'm workin wit some change yeah
And ain't afraid to put fifty up on ya brains yeah
You bout worrin over yo' people I'm the same yeah
Look, I'mma have somebody sayin that's the shame yeah
But if them people come they ain't gon' give no names yeah
Baby the number one stunna don't play no games yeah
Come outside and see nothin but camouflage and bricks
Them gather up boys strapped with cannons
Tryin to knock off yo' shit, you stanky bitch
I'll Ruff Ryde your ass then, Cash in for Money
Juve ain't gettin nuttin? ha ha ha that shit is funny..

Chorus

[Drag-On]
When my niggas get knocked we gonna bail them out
When it come to my gun my shells is out
You better get the message, cause I done mailed it out
That I'mma bang it like a hammer and I'mma nail the South
East West, and write letters for my niggas up North
My guns made in China, so you better dust off
Comin to getcha, you gon' bleed ketchup, I always got cheddar
I never ass bet ya, and I won't even sweat ya
You won't roll four and better
My dough is never low, but if Drag is down on his last
I'mma reach in my sweater, bet my Baretta
Make a nigga feel the heat in the cold weather
Can't stand a nigga hype, throw me his bitch
Bitch come to my shit, you betta come get her
Be like a dog with a bone I run with her
Y'all make me so tired
Y'all niggas still rappin like you don't know my flow is fire
And y'all ain't got ya suits, ain't got ya boots
Probably gotta gun that ain't never shoot
When we come you better hope they don't name you
Cause like two sticks rubbin I'll flame you
Don't try to be me cause I ain't you
'fore I have your spirit with the angels
My shorty keep a gun on the ankles
Wanna fuck? Watch out she'll bang you
Cause I taught her well, y'all players better haul to hell
But you niggas couldn't borrow a belt
Whoever wit you is goin to jail
Do you niggas bust your guns? Oh you ain't bustin none, huh?
You wanna fuck em til they cum, huh?
Drag-On, Juvenile, Double R, what you want huh?

Chorus 2X[Hook:Swizz Beatz]
It's the world's greatest
(Ruff Ryders)
Make you throw your bike's up
Make you rep your hood, now scream
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Murda Mook]
I think I'm getting why these motherfuckers hate me
Cause I've been putting pressure on everything lately
And I'm here pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that being said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of y'all it's no courtesy
I'm not a ??? none of y'all burden me
Next generation of the double R lights up
I'm the next nigga that's gon' make 'em throw they bikes up
I literally had million's watching me
On the stage turning dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cash
These niggas is chickens in beef steady talking bout they go HAM
You confused you meat lover
I got Swizz feeling like Dre when he made Deep Cover
I'm the next Double R meal ticket
Make like a deck of cards nigga, deal with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drag On]
My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull on the Phantom when you see a don in it
Glove box you might see the Quran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong with it
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relay my bars and remastered every one
Nigga's wondering where the fuck Drag at
I'm on Twitter hitting everybody back
Drag to the dash I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came with
If I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change shit
Now I'mma shine when the rain get thick nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie G, ayo
All the pretty girls go round the outside
Porsche or the Range Rover meet me in the ride
Windows all jet black you ain't gotta hide
Donnie, Razor Ramone, Bobby Backlund
This my throne cranberry silver patron, they love me
Hat back like I'm 15 face clean
Nice blue jeans sitting on the Louie
I used to run base and I don't mean ???
A long way from Dr Jays and Conways
I still like hoodrats some Beyonces
Pop off you ain't ever seen Ak's
Top down, Eddie Levert and the O'Jays (whoa)
Donnie killing that UFO
It took a little while but Donnie gon' blow
Hater's seen Sheek nope, Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Ayo, personally I think I'm underrated if nothing else
Ask around, they'll tell you Jada is something else
Motherfuck who they know it's the kid with the diesel bars and ??? flow
It's a couple dudes I ain't got rid of yet
But it ain't no rush, niggas is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it's time for the blood to get spilled
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed
Hustler, artist, CEO, on the low
Blowing strawberry Kiwi dro
Sling cane til they cut off my hands, other than that
I'mma spit pain til they cut off my glands
Got work all over the stove
Getting money all over the globe
In the Range all over road
Cribs and the whips is lavish
Double R mob life, kiss...

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Styles P]
You know me, playing kiss ??? with your bitch
She can call time, running trio on ya bitch
Shoot 'em in the mouth, bet you he ain't gonnna snitch
Fucking with 3 bad niggas
Telling your girlfriend to tea bag niggas
She's wavy, we crazy
ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money mansion Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, OG's, crack babies
Loading up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine avocado, salad with the lamb and
Cilantro head honcho, rocking the poncho
Way out in Mexico, 10 for the bird let you place the decimal
Turn your ass vegetable

[Hook]

[Verse 6: DMX]
You the next nigga, well, I'm the ex nigga
Name still ringing bells so fuck the rest nigga
I do this shit for real
Y'all niggas is acting, I'm old school like Andre the giant and Bob
Backlund
Cats ain't never been able to ever
Fuck with the dog, whatever the weather
I come through, niggas bow down like Muslims praying
I'm just trying to understand what these fools are saying
Don't make me, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it came down to, fuck outta here
Cats gotta fear, a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to AZ
Bitch you fucking crazy, thinking Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it, as soon as soon as dog spot it
I'mma scratch to the death, til there's half of 'em left
I'm the last of 'em left, til the last of my breath

[Hook][Hook]
My niggas this is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs my niggas

[Verse 1: Kasino]
My dogs the beginning of this bloodline of mine
That spark this in a nigga's heart and cause him to shine
Before the rhyme lessons that I keep in my mind, I owe you
And I give my right hand to show you
Whether its fist or guns whatever it go to
Its me they go through if ever they want to
I'd light the flame, dead game and trying to scratch
K-A-S I know where my dogs is at

[Verse 2:]
And I'm gonna be the one behind just to keep you on your toes
I be your extra eyes and hold you down around your foes
I be your extra gun, if you need me let me know
For my dogs I be the first to cock it back and let it go
They do it for the dough me I do it for the love
You're my nigga to the death so I treat you like my blood
If push comes to shove and they try to send you back to the streets
I give my last to put you back on your feet, feel me

[Hook x2]
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs... my niggas

[Verse 3: Drag-On]
You my dog nigga I die for
Shit bust a five for see the judge and lie for
You the type of nigga I throw weight up on the block for
Just go ahead and lock jaws, and your half? I got yours
Send in the dog I smell it all night
I told niggas to shut up and write X barks with a hell of a bite
For the love, they always will be till they kill me
I put my thugs on it and slide 'til I die on it

[Verse 4]
And to my mothafuckin' dogs big ups to your first share
Niggas know the deal just waitin for them plaques to get shipped
Do your thing, nigga, you know we got your back
Cause real dogs always return with food for the pack
Why these wack niggas swinging when they gonna miss
Take it from me he was nice before all this
Yo, X, rain on em cause after that comes the blood
Ruff Ryders feed all they dogs wit raw blood

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: DMX]
My people show love (what!) and haven't left me stranded yet
Though I have a death wish it ain't been granted yet
So until then I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (come on)
Until the lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless my body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it wasn't going for it
My nigga had to give it to me (AHH!) then I saw it
This is clear as day I know here's the day
I'm gonna be on my way nothing more to say
But take me lord make me lord what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill
Been downhill from then on cause I been on
Some shit hit on every move to get ten on
The next sac but you know that's how X act
That's why these street niggas is waiting for the next track

[Hook][Intro: Swizz Beatz]
WHOO! Yeah yeah (Swizzie!)

[Verse One: Swizz Beatz]
Be in the scene, I'm makin that cream

I'm comin through your block, got somethin mean (mean)
The Ferrari pink, it blings (blings)
Yep, I got suede in my dash

That black card make them chicks move FAHST
Can you hear me now? Can you see me now?

The Ruff Ryders start it, now just shout it!

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Verse Two: Swizz Beatz]
Man... now engine engine, number 9
You talkin crazy, you lose your mind
And if that chucker wanna throw that stack
Well pick it up, HEY, pick it up - you don't know me
But Kanye know my name; Timbo, know my name

[Drag-On]
Me and my niggas done licked shots, even done hit cops
Betcha niggas can't wait til my shit drop
Treat you like your momma, give you lip a pop
Nigga you don't want my clip to drop
Cause that means I'm empty, and you're full of it
Check what the bullet did
Missiles gonna hit you get you, rip through tissue
Shoot another rhyme just cause I missed you
I make plus cash, you little niggas can't fuck wit Drag
Got the chain out, so his muscle grabs
Nigga fuck that, you better bust back
'fore ya monkey-ass land where the dust at
Ride like the girl but you can't trust cash
Spit line of fire and he can't touch black
All you can do is cuss back
In your weak raps bout how you bust gats
Nigga we don't need that, I don't care about your feedback
Y'all niggas don't feed Drag
Til a motherfucker pull out, bust a bullet out
In the safe house, nigga where the keys at
Nigga where the stash at, nigga where the weed at
Nigga pass that 'fore I pull my trigger
Matter fact where the ass at, cause I got the "Rough Rider"
And I ain't talkin bout my niggas
Cause nigga we can go ho for ho, toe to toe, blow for blow
And when you feel your nose crack
That mean I broke that, I fill a po'-po' wit a flame thrower
Like I told yo' befo' ya know umm - you can't handle
You can put me on wax but my fire burn candles
And who that nigga Ruff Rydin, Drag-On
Y'all niggas and Southsiders

Chorus: Drag-On + Various (repeat 2X)

Do y'all niggas bust y'all guns?
(Hell yeah we bust our guns!!)
Do y'all fuck them til they cum?
(Damn right we make them cum!!)
It's for the North (HEY) South (HEY)
East (HEY) West (HEY)
Ruff Ryders gonna show y'all niggas who ride the best

[Juvenile]
Hmmmm, hmmmmmmmm
In the late night, we be cockin iron and givin you stage fright
Yo head might explode, when I bust with the lead pipe
Now say it right, Juvenile, Head tight
Stay hype, now page Mike and make sure he got all the yay, aight?
I'm tired of you niggas, be thinkin that you usin me
Runnin with them petty-ass niggas lookin like fools to me
I'm workin wit some change yeah
And ain't afraid to put fifty up on ya brains yeah
You bout worrin over yo' people I'm the same yeah
Look, I'mma have somebody sayin that's the shame yeah
But if them people come they ain't gon' give no names yeah
Baby the number one stunna don't play no games yeah
Come outside and see nothin but camouflage and bricks
Them gather up boys strapped with cannons
Tryin to knock off yo' shit, you stanky bitch
I'll Ruff Ryde your ass then, Cash in for Money
Juve ain't gettin nuttin? ha ha ha that shit is funny..

Chorus

[Drag-On]
When my niggas get knocked we gonna bail them out
When it come to my gun my shells is out
You better get the message, cause I done mailed it out
That I'mma bang it like a hammer and I'mma nail the South
East West, and write letters for my niggas up North
My guns made in China, so you better dust off
Comin to getcha, you gon' bleed ketchup, I always got cheddar
I never ass bet ya, and I won't even sweat ya
You won't roll four and better
My dough is never low, but if Drag is down on his last
I'mma reach in my sweater, bet my Baretta
Make a nigga feel the heat in the cold weather
Can't stand a nigga hype, throw me his bitch
Bitch come to my shit, you betta come get her
Be like a dog with a bone I run with her
Y'all make me so tired
Y'all niggas still rappin like you don't know my flow is fire
And y'all ain't got ya suits, ain't got ya boots
Probably gotta gun that ain't never shoot
When we come you better hope they don't name you
Cause like two sticks rubbin I'll flame you
Don't try to be me cause I ain't you
'fore I have your spirit with the angels
My shorty keep a gun on the ankles
Wanna fuck? Watch out she'll bang you
Cause I taught her well, y'all players better haul to hell
But you niggas couldn't borrow a belt
Whoever wit you is goin to jail
Do you niggas bust your guns? Oh you ain't bustin none, huh?
You wanna fuck em til they cum, huh?
Drag-On, Juvenile, Double R, what you want huh?

Chorus 2X[Styles P]
Holiday Styles
Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck
If I ain't gettin proper respect
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die
I ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)
Cause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)
You know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O
You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast

[Sheik]
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool
And I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school
No pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God
Play Sheik out in the yard, but that shit too hard
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die
From rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga
Bounty hunt your whole crew til my bullets go through, WHAT?

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
All I need is a big gun and a Coupe that's crazy quick
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip
Bet you never even felt the heat
Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease
Streets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox
Same niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)
All types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh)
Nice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)
Find your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)
It's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)
Uh

[Drag-On]
Creep through the streets
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard
Me the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off
And take casket naps, fuck that
You shoulda never let this bastard rap
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance
So you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin
Drag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em
Drag done ate your food
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well
I don't brag I let the streets tell
Po'-po' now you see he fell

[DMX] {*overlapping last line*}
Uh, uh, now you motherfuckers
Know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)
Y'all bitches fear it cause you weak
You wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin (uh-huh)
What the science behind that son? (I don't know)
A lot of easy walkin
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)
Ain't tryin to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon)
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh)
It can get "Dark" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that
Now don't act, cause actin might get you rollin
With what you ain't ready to handle (UHH)
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)
It happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas
Talkin reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)
From the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight
Let them cats spit that weak shit (What!)
I'm DOG FOR LIFE! NIGGA!

I don't really want to hurt nobody, I just want to live my life
Feel me, come on, baby, where we at, baby, let's get it, come on

[Verse One]
How many niggers' seen a shotgun shot
Looks like something's coming at you non-stop
A James Brown make you say it loud, let's walk through this block, head up
And, anybody can pop a lead off, let me see you shoot a fifty calibre
And, pop a head of, we can read it all, I said whoever's in my target
I'm going to end it all, some niggers' better move back, move back
Somebody better duck their head
Because your buddy's mum's about to be in the 'All Black'
Because a niggers' white tee is about to turn red, and I don't give a fuck
When I'm sitting before the judge, 'Yeah, I did it, what'
Pumping in the cell by myself because I don't want to hurt nobody

[Hook]
I'm the hood, I'm those streets', I'm them lyrics' enemies, I'm that weed
I'm that 'X', I'm that sex that you need, I'm that nigga with your wife
Sound like the plumber's playing pipes, I'm that match that you light
When you ain't got no life, I'm your fireman

[Verse Two]
Who the fuck said Drag couldn't come back, he said it, now where's my gun at
Nigger won that because I done raised a lot of niggers'
And, now I want my sons' back, I catch a nigger at a party, matter of fact
I be up in his lobby letting my man hold my shotty, niggers'
I don't want to hrt nobody with some guns, I've got to do what I've got to do
Pull out, and then shoot who I've got to shoot, hang a nigger off the roof
By his shoes, and slip, I hope he's got a parachute, I'm the zone, dog
I'm by myself at my home, dog, everybody, just leave me the fuck alone, dog
Because I don't want to hurt nobody

[Hook]
I'm the hood, I'm those streets', I'm them lyrics' enemies, I'm that weed
I'm that 'X', I'm that sex that you need, I'm that nigger with your wife
Sound like the plumber's playing pipes, I'm that match that you light
When you ain't got no life, I'm your fireman

[Verse Three]
I wasn't grown right, my head wasn't screwed on tight
Andm so I pause every line because it takes time
For a boss to be mad about his crime, this is how I deal with a snitch
Cut his tongue out, and mail it to his bitch because when a nigger run his lips
That makes me want to hurt somebody, but I ain't that nigger, that, uh
Come over for chitter chatter because if you owe me a favor
Talking don't really matter, either you've got it or you don't
Or you will or you won't, trying to take your dough, you ain't no better
Hide your thoughts, now you on life support, and can't cry, might die driving
Pull the stick, I'm going to pull up in my Audi, niggers'
Because I don't want to hurt nobody

[Hook]
I'm the hood, I'm those streets', I'm them lyrics' enemies, I'm that weed
I'm that 'X', I'm that sex that you need, I'm that nigger with your wife
Sound like the plumber's playing pipes, I'm that match that you light
When you ain't got no life, I'm your fireman[Hook]
My niggas this is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs my niggas

[Verse 1: Kasino]
My dogs the beginning of this bloodline of mine
That spark this in a nigga's heart and cause him to shine
Before the rhyme lessons that I keep in my mind, I owe you
And I give my right hand to show you
Whether its fist or guns whatever it go to
Its me they go through if ever they want to
I'd light the flame, dead game and trying to scratch
K-A-S I know where my dogs is at

[Verse 2:]
And I'm gonna be the one behind just to keep you on your toes
I be your extra eyes and hold you down around your foes
I be your extra gun, if you need me let me know
For my dogs I be the first to cock it back and let it go
They do it for the dough me I do it for the love
You're my nigga to the death so I treat you like my blood
If push comes to shove and they try to send you back to the streets
I give my last to put you back on your feet, feel me

[Hook x2]
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
This is for my dogs... my niggas

[Verse 3: Drag-On]
You my dog nigga I die for
Shit bust a five for see the judge and lie for
You the type of nigga I throw weight up on the block for
Just go ahead and lock jaws, and your half? I got yours
Send in the dog I smell it all night
I told niggas to shut up and write X barks with a hell of a bite
For the love, they always will be till they kill me
I put my thugs on it and slide 'til I die on it

[Verse 4]
And to my mothafuckin' dogs big ups to your first share
Niggas know the deal just waitin for them plaques to get shipped
Do your thing, nigga, you know we got your back
Cause real dogs always return with food for the pack
Why these wack niggas swinging when they gonna miss
Take it from me he was nice before all this
Yo, X, rain on em cause after that comes the blood
Ruff Ryders feed all they dogs wit raw blood

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: DMX]
My people show love (what!) and haven't left me stranded yet
Though I have a death wish it ain't been granted yet
So until then I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (come on)
Until the lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless my body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it wasn't going for it
My nigga had to give it to me (AHH!) then I saw it
This is clear as day I know here's the day
I'm gonna be on my way nothing more to say
But take me lord make me lord what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill
Been downhill from then on cause I been on
Some shit hit on every move to get ten on
The next sac but you know that's how X act
That's why these street niggas is waiting for the next track

[Hook]HOOK: DMX
Drag-On, niggas act on
Messin wit the team it's gon be a sad song
X, will bring the day and the night
Cuz we get it right, get it right, get it right, spit it right

[DMX]
Moves is made, niggas is paid, that's just how it is
When my time is up I'mma be out but I'mma try to live
I'm eatin day by day, ain't nothin sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm sayin and you'll read about it
Built for war like a armadillo
Smokin yo' ass put two through the pilllow
Hey my shit is Brillo
Manic depressive and my head hurts
Soon as the dead thirst I'll whet him first
Now wait a minute it gets worse
I can't control what I own inside
So I take it out on the soul of that kid that died
Spit fire, cross niggas like barbecues
Mobbin crews, strippin niggas, robbin crews
And put him speechless, when I made him eat this
Hollow tip and you can follow grip
You be like Kim and ain't gon swallow shit
Don't know the half, couldn't know the math
To understand the wrath of a man split in half
But he got what he wanted, shot for three hundred
Shit is tight and a nigga that's right gots to run it
Ain't no question, that's how I get down, niggas know
Gimme yo' dough and yo' ho, and here take these fo'
Hot things I got things that make niggas spin
Put niggas in the wind, where you never see niggas again
Bless a nigga with stitches, the thin type
And a straight razor will put pinstripes across your windpipe

HOOK 2X

[Drag-On]
Drag opposite water more than a spot order
My flows cause fire then bring holes
Takes more than a pump to out this little punk
'less that pump is a twelve, and I get popped, still I burn to hell
Call the police and whatever they don't seize
And put in they mouth, and catch freeze, tell em throw Drag some keys
Don't care how many oyeas I gotta make believe
If you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi please
Cats stealin gats y'all probably will get hit
Well I'm the future let's see y'all copy this, stopping this
Since a tiny kid like, "mommy buy me this"
Since she always told me no, started stealin on some grimy shit
Like look at that, now look at that slide it in my bookbag
I'm who, parents point they fingers at, "get from that hoodrat"
And put it back, fuck tough, while y'all cook crack
I'm cocaine, throw me in the pot, I rise to the top
With your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs
Stil put them holes in yo' head, til it's mushy like dough bread
Cuz that vest only protects that chest
And if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated
Or it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes
Double R got me comin hard on you haters
Cuz we the streets black and y'all belong beneath that

HOOK 2X[Swizz Beatz]

Its Groundhog day, its Groundhog day

Verse 1:
Wake up in the morning wipe the cold from my eyes
Put my dick in, grab the ashtray and take a tote from the lye
Hear the folks outside, kids cutting school
Grab the remote play the hot shit of course my shit
Steam up the bathroom till the mirrors fog
Can't wait to ball, with my niggas god
Dry off splash on the Izzi Miak
Cut up the rock, head for the door oops forgot
You know I can't leave my chrome thats my love jones
Niggas in front of the building niggas making a killing
But when I come through niggas catching they feelings
Cuz the fiends follow who cuz my bottles be spilling
I can hear em now "What'd he get a ship from Brazil?"
"Its gotta be good look at the fiends leaving they children"
And thats fucked up niggas mad cuz my pockets bucked up
With my clique pull the truck up
Yo hold up, let me get this dough before it slow up
Then we can go see about some ass and go cut some hash
This bundle is my last jump in the ride whats that
DMX shit go head put it on my shit
DMX:(from Look Thru my Eyes)
Burning in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Drag: Every day is the same day
Just because they heard of me and they know that
The dark is for real, the bark is for real
When you see that spark it'll kill

Verse 2:
Ayo, go down to the fifth, aight
You know where D and them be standing thick
Fucking wit them chicks that strip and niggas that claim they spit
But all I hear is they want out like I got my gun out
Cuz they rhymes run out, running off at the mouth
Yo Ralph lets be out, back to the BX
Royal blue Chevy followed by the GS
Keep the guns heavy just in case some b.s
Cuz niggas like to test me should I say he rest
Hop on the celly, yo hit the deacon
This nigga say he ain't got my money and I just don't believe him
So we gonna give him a little scare
Let him know whats love is love but with my slugs its no fair
And how the soldiers come out of nowhere for the dollars
And how we keep our products I'm a holla, tomorrow
Cuz for some reason its always a hater around
Then you know me, duffing em out and busting em down
Then I drop off my nigga, pick up my chick up
Cuz she volunteer dick suck, with a little liquor
Just watch out for her mister, now I'm in the crib
Twisting out her rib
Didn't hear the baby father coming with the kids
Now I'm in some shit, and the closets un-roomy
Plus to me thats unruly
So I played like a robber running out flashing a tooly
Got undressed when I got home didn't let nobody in
Then I woke up the next morning the same shit happened again

Everyday is the same day
Its Groundhog day (till end)Intro:

I might buy 'em cooked
Dough I might buy 'em raw
And I might tap your chin
Or I might cross your jaw
[Swizz Beatz]
Now I might go 18's
I might go 20's
I might use dumdums
Cause y'all Niggas dummies

Chorus:

Verse 2:
[Sheek a.k.a Louch]
Ayo, me without weight
Is like Harlem without 8
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood]
Yeah, me with no funds
Is like Queens with no dunns
[Styles a.k.a Holiday]
And me with no beef
Is like Brooklyn with no guns
[Swizz Beatz]
Man and me with no beats
Is like Cali with no blunts
[Sheek a.k.a Louch]
First I got head from her
Then I hit her from the back
Then she told me that she hustled
So I hit her with a pack
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood]
Yeah, screw how many mics you got
How much ice you got
My bullets'll make you icy-hot
[Styles a.k.a Holiday]
Y'all, all my Niggas killas
We don't talk on the phone
And give a way better message
When we come in your home
[Swizz Beatz]
Yo, catch me Down-South
When I'm pumpin' up things
And my name ain't Rover
Don't jump on my rings
[Sheek a.k.a Louch]
Man, you gotta have your hustle right
When you up in the game
[Jada a.k.a Kisseastwood]
You gotta have your lawyor money
For you firm-aly change
[Styles a.k.a Holiday]
And don't you leave out the house
Without bringer your things
[Swizz Beatz]
We gonna Ruff Ryde, Nigga
]From here to the bank

Interlude:
[Sheek a.k.a Louch]
What you greaseball cocksuckers thought it was over
This double R, Nigga, L.O.X
We are the streets
When the kennels is open the dogs is biting, bitch
Shits real

Verse 3:
[Drag-on]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I might pull up in a V
That cost more than a buck
Then turn around and burn it
Cause you thought it was plush
[Eve]
Anytime I get on fire
I get a car to match
And tell any rapper you name
You gard it black
[Drag-On]
When I bust my hammer
I nail my Nigga
We the Ruff Ryder family
All hail, my Niggas
[Eve]
And I might ride, I might die
That's up to the Lord
And my Niggas might come home
That's up to the ?
[Drag-On]
Yo, If money make you feel good
I'm happy with lead
Joe Pesci-style
Kickin' Niggas after they dead
[Eve]
Picture the litter
Hold the 4-5th for my Niggas
Writin' the venom
Ass look right in the dinner
[Drag-On]
?Dockin'? you pay
Word from me you clockin' the Yay
I hustle for real
Let you hold the block for a day
[Eve]
Pull it in your brain
And give you a hot idea
You wanna low
Here's a casket you can hide out there

Chorus: til fade[Drag-On]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Fuck y'all niggas talkin 'bout huh? ["it's time I see you...]

Y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
Wit two niggas downstairs wit ?licensed guns? to take y'all home
Scared ass niggas, you think they gon take a life so they can get life [nope]
Ask Puff they ain't tryin to hear that nigga
For no cake, and y'all can get at us on Labor Day
We make stones that say pay ya debt on your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
Handheld don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double R's hoodrat
The nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit

[Cross]
Y'all bitches think the ryders a joke, well I don't play [let's go]
I blow you whole fuckin shit up like Tim McVeigh
Gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today

I ain't the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse

[Infa-Red]
Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizin [sorry]
I'm at your wake in the choir standin harmonizin
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
Hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
So stop frontin vegetarian just scared of beef

[Eve]
Yo, ay suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridickliss
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit

You keep claimin you the best that done it

Same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
Outta all the camps in this game, nigga

Who kick the real shit before the fame
Fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
Still play the hood while you ride past niggas
Coward trust me, we keep it gutter
Hope you stay mad a hater cuz you can't touch us, huh

"It's time I see you..."
[Styles]
Ayo, I ain't got a care in the world
Kidnappin your kid, maimin your mom, and airin your girl
And like, you ain't got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
And I'm down for smokin blunts to the head
My nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about goin to Chao
And my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
If you heard about me beefin dog I leave the most shells
The nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, givin you pound

[Sheek]
What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
Like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rappin, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
Right in front of the radio station
Motherfuckers ain't quiet til the tech go off
Arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfuckin hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
Whatever the label
Y'all niggas don't want beef, y'all want meat at the table
And I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
Before any of y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, c'mon

[Jadakiss]
Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
If you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
And I'm known for gettin money, not known for wildin
But I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
This is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
Everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
Cuz the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirtin
When they start hurtin, that means they workin
Only way we comin is hard
Industry is like jail nigga, double R's runnin the yard, uh[Hook: Stephen Marley]
And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than di knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of di flesh is not di ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go ah Zion and ah wear jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
The body's just a vehicle
Transporting the soul
Its whats inside the people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer

[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got
Lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins

[Verse 4: Capleton]
The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of di beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer
Live much longer
Careful how you entertain stranger
Selassie never born inna nuh manger
I'll never crucify as me savior
Elect off himself inna the ruler
Babylon ah nah malfunction well dem a failure
So be careful of dem cellular and pager
Cause I sign see dem I see danger
So dem great but Selaisse I greater

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Drag-on]
He did mi wanna lick upon shots
Upon a bloodclad
And fill the block with bum rush cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across mi yards And
Before another brother's in chalk And
I 'magine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott free
So police mi gonna pop you b'fore you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars
Storm upon mi prada
Watch a bomb holla
Watch 'im run, hit the floor
Told 'im come, come no
Throw ya ganja pon de air
'plah!'

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Damian Marley]
Watch for sticks and stones
Stumbling blocks in piles
Life is one big road
Miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul
That always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic
Blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic
And always be aware
The truth is crying out
And it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion
Can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

[Hook][Tikki Diamond]
Restless, haha
The East Coast (y'all know where I'm comin from)
I want it all, Warren G man
(T) Tikki Diamond, (Nigga D), don't forget, haaa
Check it out y'all

Call me Tikki Diamond 2000, I'm the future
I'm the voice that'cha need to get used ta
I want it all, y'all probably know by now
I want the world, y'all probably know by now
Here's my life, look at the three in front it
Bentley, me and Warren G in front it
Bougy nigga, I call lunch "brunch"
Old school, I call punks "chumps"
What's life without the best of it?
What's a half a ki if you ain't got the rest of it? Feel me
It's just the ways of the pros, the nay's and the no's
If y'all wanna see me, wear shades at my shows
You get G's like a fool, Killa Bees like the Wu
I ain't satisfied til I squeeze somethin new
I want it with no miles, brand new smell
Put my life on wax, you'll be like "Damn it do sell"

[Warren G]
Well aah, I want it all, I'm destined to ball (ball)
With plaques on the wall (wall), got somethin for all y'all
From ounces to quarters, and quarters to ki's
So when you come to the town you're watched over by Gz
The head honcho, buckin fools like a bronco
C-E-O, shootin cilo, ten be-low
A true vet on the worldwide set
Y'all don't know about them M-16's with bayonettes

Chorus: Warren G
I want it all, money, fast cars, diamond rings
Gold chains and champagne, shot every damn thing
I want it all, houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple of Benz's
I want it all, brand new socks and drawers
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

[Memphis Bleek]
Yeah
Yo, niggas eyeball my ho cos I'm sunk in the seat
Gettin bent, but shit I deserve to eat
I hit the blunt for my bad broads
Hit a shot from the 4's for my dead dogs, pull off
Like, fuck the world, I don't owe y'all nuttin
If I do, take it in blood, the Memph don't front
I pump, for the goods, nice house in the woods
But I'm from the projects, it don't look that good
I gotta pissy elevator (and) a dog staircase (and)
Tre-8 and crack, wan' fuck with that?
I got beef with the D's for the way I rock my jeans
Stand on the corner with blunts and Coronas
Couple of birds, and I'm tryin to hustle for birds
Throwin dice on the curb, twistin up this herb
I want money the fast way, the crack stash way
Gat blast way, the last laugh way motherfucker

Chorus

[Drag-On]
Aiyo, listen up faggots, my bullets gon' do more than nip you
It's gon' place you in sometin black where they gotta zip you
Rain wash away the chalk, and according to who you are
While you're snorin in the morgue, you'll get a drawing on the wall
You can't see me so don't look, I pop off cops like moon shook
Shells will fill you up like home cook
Forget about the book, ain't no recipe when y'all step to me
It's only one way up and that's if y'all don't pay up
Y'all pays forth, them days is up
You're lucky if you'll be able to
Walk straight enough cos I'm done with beefin
Like a bad stomach but I puts the runs in these niggas
Cos I was raised, if a nigga ass cheeks make him an athlete
Some niggas say I'm spoiled, nigga how's that?
I ain't got no mom and no dad, I ain't know where the fuck my house is at
All I knew is where them ounces at and what I'm countin back
Or if a knot come up short, who I got a pow for

Chorus (x2)[Eve] (Drag-on)
Ugh (Come on, uh)
Uh-huh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh)
Uh-uh-uh-uh (Flame on, uh, come on, uh)
Yo, yo (uh, uh)

[Eve]
Let's talk about who I am
Blond bee, find me in the hood with my peoples
Love y'all, hate the rest of y'all that I can see through
Above that, I can't feel nothin' unless it's lethal
Testin' your moves, never that, make your position fetal, uh

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about Dog nigga, L-O-X, Eve, and me
Now that's the hottest thing in the streets
Our beats is Swizz
Cheesed up with holes in the shit
Double R roll thick
And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks
Honey Roasted
Burn it 'til its been around now how the fuck that sound

[Eve]
Yo let's talk about
Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall
See me decorated, she's the one
Heard 'em say it, see me celebrate it
I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin'
I use clips for them big beefs
See me bustin', plow!

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about bitches I fucked
I'm a dog so I can't stand no bitch that hounds
I far from a clown
If I'm not knocking them down, Drag's probably not around
So I'm not one to claim by either one of you dames
If y'all catch Drag with a mane, trust me
She got my last name
Here's the hook, uh

[Drag-on]
Now Drag-on will show ya niggas how we lock this shit

[Eve]
Let's talk about little dick niggas
Always talkin' bout what you got
Rather be finger-popped
Dick probably the size of a bough stuffed with rocks
Fuck the cop nigga, go shoot pool, pussy plot
You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about guns niggas don't bust
Y'all need to see me if y'all wanna see shells pop out
I make niggas say watch out, when I got my Glock out
Niggas clock out, cause I run up in your watch house
Snatch up all your rocks out
Then throw your box out
Ya motherfuckers better watch out

[Eve]
Yo, let's talk about fake ass bitches
Lying on yourself, you ain't ready for the world mama
Beggin' every second money hungry, life drama
Get your own stacks
Why you think these niggas pussy hungry
Cause you actin' triflin'
Layin' up, takin' his money, uh

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about live or die
Fucking with I
Niggas will fry like stripped bacon
I leave them shakin'
Keep 'em sizzlin'
Fuckin' with them you might win
But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin
And us our clip is spinning
And hittin' all their men

[Eve]
I wanna talk about ryde or die
My dogs control confrontation
In any situation
Five niggas on your team
Five niggas you replacing
Five niggas used to gleam
Five niggas left with nathan
But their game that we took
And now they back to chase it

[Drag-on]
I wanna talk about biting ass niggas
Let me see y'all niggas catch the flow
Go red-vest with the four-four blow
Ya niggas gonna hit the ground for sure
Nigga let me know if you want more
If he catch you with a pound to choke, you know
Nigga never die slow, till his eyes close
Then jump on the highway, I go
Man fuck the po-po, them niggas is moving slow mo, come on

Drag (E) dash (V) on (E)Drag-On: (Speaking) Life is crazy man, it's fucked up
(You a half a nigga)
You was never there for me, you know. You know, take care of yours
When I get mine, I'mma take care of mine
You can believe that, for real

Chorus: You know what you did was wrong
But still, life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

(Add after first verse)
You never taught me the streets
And didn't know what you mean to me
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

Verse 1:
Let me ask you a question
Even though I was your reflection
You showed this nigga no love, me and you was no connection
You flipped on my moms and she had your ass arrested
But still, when you was there, my eyes was lit up like flourescents
So I read up on my lessons
Now, I'm fed up with your prescense
You yellin', B's is screamin', "Man shut up and get the message"
Things I used to do
Which reminded me of you
But I'm gone, and I'm doin' it and I'm doin fine dude
Look at what you did by and started
You had a mind but you was heartless
You shouldn't have spit me out dog, now I'm going to shine regardless
Supposed to leave me high, but I was already above it yo
You hated me to the point I was the way you loved it yo
But fuck it though
I wouldn't care if you kicked the bucket yo
My dick you can suck it yo
But it wasn't for nothin yo
You was here to leave a new chapter, Drag-On baby
Thoughts from now will live on, til I'm dead and gone baby
You was wrong
But now I'm older spittin' the bomb
Gettin' lit on
Just livin off this written from the arm
I was given from the mind since you wasn't there nigga
Can't believe you had me cryin', you wasn't worth a tear nigga
I used to be in the crib, no money, no food, hopin' for you
Now you and yours peepin' at my bocu's
My lyrics, going to haunt you
You feel this one don't you
Why don't you kill me with precaution
You should have just had an abortion, for real

Repeat Chorus 1x

Verse 2:
I guess there's ways of life I have yet to learn
Like Drag-On, and how many niggas I have yet to burn
With no rice on the shelf
That's when I learned life itself
Only Chow, that's why I hit the mic for delf
Fear no one
I was taught to care for no one
Hard-hitter
Little nigga, cause I ain't hittin' no one
All I heard was me tellin' bitches to get in that bed
Gettin' that head
Me and my niggas gettin' that bread
Shit wasn't right because during that I didn't know you
I guess it's true
Things you don't know, you're gonna go through
On the phone, tellin' my man, "I'm about to blow dude"
Moms on the other line, saying, "You about to blow who?"
"Oh, ain't nothin' ma. Yo, I'll call you later"
My moms, was zoned out
The days to the froze was blown out
Cut the stove on the days I was alone in the house
There was alot of shit missin', talkin' about she loaned it out
It was thug livin', and there was nothing I could do stop it
Shit was hard like a kindergarten kid in college
Started makin' profit, that's how I built my wealth
And what I did, shit ony the fools will quit up on hisself
I didn't know how I did it by myself
Sometimes it drove me to drinkin' so I spit up on myself
And you know what, out of all that, I'm about to blow up
Til I'm six feet, I'mma tear it up from the floor up
Nigga what

Repeat Chorus 1x

Life still goes on
But you was wrong
You wasn't my daddy, daddy

You still was wrong
But life still goes on
You wasn't my daddy, daddy1. Kiedyś słyszałam historię o życiu, Ci ludzie chcieli przez nie razem iść
Walczyli o to i to ich zgubiło, i każdy z nich samotny jest dziś
Mówili na to „miłość i szczęście”, dziś mówią tylko „ból i łzy”
I nikt nie wierzy im w tę przepowiednię i sen się skończył... pstryk
Wstajesz nad ranem, znów inny wymiar, wczorajsza wódka przypomina ten syf
Dziś już ich nie ma, są poza zasięgiem, jak spotkasz ich to pozdrów ich
Jay-Z nauczył mnie jak żyć, co robić by nie wpaść po uczy w dopeshit
To jak Mac Miller nawijam o niczym i lecę dalej... ŻYJ!
Nie zawsze jest tak jak ma być, walcz jak Bruce Lee
Dobrze wiesz że najlepszą obroną jest atak
Czasem jest z górki, czasem pod górkę i znowu z górki i krąg się zatacza
Tak leci czas czas, tak lecą marzenia, masz jedną szansę, życie nie zawraca
Biegnę po wszystko i tam gdzie Luter padł, w XXI się odradzam

Ref: Drogi zawsze są dwie, nie zawsze takie jak chcesz
Nie wszystko wyjdzie, lecz to ma czegoś nauczyć Cię
Zakręty na drodze są, nie po to by myśleć, że
Życie to zło. nie zawsze tak jak chcesz

2. Pokochałem Cię bardziej niż rap, to już osiągnięcie
Miałem swoją chwilę w Twoim sercu i nic więcej
Teraz nie ma nic, nie ma nas, nie ma zalet, nie ma wad
Nie ma nas, więc po chuj czas, połączył nas, świat był nasz
Romantyk ze mnie żaden, ale w sumie po co mi to
Nie latałem za cipką, szukałem co to miłość
I patrzyłem na przyszłość, ale mi nie wyszło
Trudno - kochałaś. Ale uczucie prysło
I to niby moja wina, sory zajebałem sprawę
Straciłem co miałem, teraz tracę własny talent
Teraz tracę całą wiarę, brakuje mi weny
Bo w życiu wychodzi nie zawsze tak jak chcemy
Jesteś przyszłą niedoszłą żoną, przyszłaś - odeszłaś znowu
Witam i żegnam zrozum, życie proste na pozór
Pozór ? Pozwól po prostu, dotknąć mi znów twych włosów
Widzę łzy, cieknące z oczu i mam tego dość już
I obiecaj mi, że gdy patrzysz w chmury widzisz mnie tam
A nie gwiazdy, bo tych kurew nie pamiętam
Nie pamiętam, żeby były z nami, kiedy zawiść grała z nami
I sercami połączeni niczym zakochani
Teraz, klaszcz w swoje dłonie, myśl - tylko w swojej głowie
Idź i za myślą "idź", możesz skakać w ogień
To jest wszystko chore, ale jedno wiem, to
Nie zawsze tak jak chcemy, próbujemy tego sięgnąć[Swizz Beatz]
Keep yo' hands in the air, cause we gon' take you there
And I know it ain't fair, but we just don't care..
Uh-huh, uh, what

Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug for me

[DMX]
Uhh, uhh
If I'm gonna rob, I'mma rob all night
If I'm lookin for somethin it's probably a fight
If I'm goin fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play I'mma play til I win
Since I gots to be here can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty can't stand shorty friend
Cause honey friend fuck many many men
Stay wit the rats cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework - I lay it down for the hoes
Hit em off with that dark brown, you know?

Chorus

[Drag-On]
Y'know fuckin wit me, ain't keepin your health right
Cause me and my Rolls, we keep it jail tight
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shell is light
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin anything that I'm puttin my name on
You might take a 'Drag', but you can't flame 'On'
I know y'all niggas to homey, wit a chain on
When it come to the fire I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars then y'all know who we are
Niggas spittin mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that but for now dog give me that
Cause dog you don't wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin niggas you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (C'MON!)

Chorus

[DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you, what to hope and to fear

Uhh, uhh
What you niggas want? Cause I got it right here
Y'all niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit - will ride in the fog
Same thing but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On, cause he spits the flame
Drag-On motherfucker don't forget the name
And we all takin over ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob nigga quit the game
And ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no other cats gon' shed blood wit me
But my dogs, is gon' be a thug wit me, c'mon!

Chorus

Do you hear what I tell you? Understand what you hear

Yo, yo I could keep my eyes closed, still reading the signs
Young niggas think they hungry then you feed em a nine
Might kidnap they ass start feedin em swine
So I don't feel bad when I gut em like a pig
Beat him down, stomp him out, cut him like he big
You hear the attitude I say fuck being humble
You act like a animal you stuck in the jungle
Niggas don't care if I'm poor or rich
So I don't care about these niggas and the law and shit
And I'll probably get shot for being a wild nigga
You'll probably get shot for being a foul nigga
Let's talk about slugs and the drugs we deal
Boys fight, men kill, get they money and chill
Real recognize real I ain't sayin a word
Doin 80 in the M that means I'm stayin in third
With a bitch playin shottie AK in the third

[Sheek Louch]
Don't worry bout what I make worry 'bout can you escape
Cuz when I bust my guns bring more action than roll take
Nickel your hallway, I got aim from far
Y'all can't see me like the tints on the president's car
I know niggas don't like me and my friends wanna flip
That's why I'm on some extra all about Sheek shit
Your money, Sheek shit, your bitch, Sheek shit
Only thing I'm gonna share is these bullets here
Bitch ass that's for frontin now don't say I never gave you nothin
I'm greedy, go head, don't say I never saved you somethin
Pack gun nigga but don't want no stack
I drink straight liquor til I forget where I'm at
I don't play no games nigga, drugs my 'cupation
In a building hustlin that's Sheek's play station
Motherfuckers wanna ride by and ice grill
Change that to ice dick, show me motherfucker that you can kill

HOOK: Styles Paniro
17 shots in a clip, 28 grams in an ounce
Everybody bounce, 26 inch hues on a truck
36 O's in a key, everybody ree
Murder One felons with the Glocks, 24 hours on the block
Bodies gettin dropped, 5000 niggas actin live
5000 niggas gotta die, everybody better ride

[Jadakiss]
Y'all niggas better find out who's your man
It don't work in the hood you could fool your fans
Few bullets in your jeans soon to ruin your plans
Then I show up at the wake and boo-hoo at your fam
If you like me you never'll fail
Live by the three rules you make it, or be dead or in jail
And I ain't really got much but I'm up on cats
And Kiss don't just spit I throw up on tracks
Double R now bitch you see the princess cut
I'm in a 2000 big boy the tense is up
Y'all niggas is soft, catch me with the semi
Underneath the Fendi, sweater, skully, and scarf
Make sure you don't say nothing to Jay
And keep your dirt, I don't smoke nothin but hays
I'mma do this the old way get it while I can get it
As much as I can get then I'mma go my own way

[Drag-On]
Ayo I keep my guns like laundry
I dump a load, make niggas fold, watch em die, and let em drip dry
Gon spill pints from niggas, my rapid fire put niggas in black attire
Stuffed in the hearse, then dumped in the dirt
I live eternal, cuz if Drag pass away
I'mma come back with wraps on my face, blastin an eighth
February 8th, that's the day
You better cop like it's crack, or get masking taped til you suffocate
Bitches, y'all gettin your feelings hurt
2000 I ain't fuckin no more, I'm makin bitches jerk til I squirt
All my bitches work, like upside down from the poles
Lift that skirt, give this dick what it's worth
Double R, see the icicles on the chest
Hungry niggas come snatchin, I throw bullets run catch em
Ruff Ryder scene Drag the fire
But we could take it swingin them irons til the bangs is flyin

HOOK 2X[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
This thing right here
Is for my peoples in the streets
And this thing right here
Will get your ass off your feet

[Verse 1: Drag-On]
They call me Drag-On, when it's time to bomb
I burn em all, til they all say turn em off
Cause these chips, I'mma run em all
Chickenheads, know I, be the Colonel
Cause I burn eternal, mixed wit the inferno
So be careful, 'fore I burn you
You better learn dude, yeah I heard you
But I'mma hurt you, but you don't know?
My versatile, is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which means
A lot cream, lot of schemes
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough
Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust? Cause we do
You need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently
Is you buying this?
Cause niggas that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag-On; I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkers
But this Bronx bombers spittin' flame
So you better wear your armor
Flame on!

[Hook x2: DMX]
My dogs gon' stop , your dogs gon' drop
And then we gon' shut 'em down, open up shop
First we had em like "ohhh"
Now they like "nooo!"
What baby?!! That's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my Glock up
You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
If you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
And then give it to a modelin bitch
And you like your watch plain, I'mma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time

[Verse 3: Styles]
Y'all niggas ain't hearin me out, til I pop up
Appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin the clip
And the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man?
When I cock back and hop out the van
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, and snatch your R
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge

[Verse 4: Eve]
Guess you figured that my niggas, flippers, pullin triggers
News team crowd around, tryin to flick a picture
Get witcha, this bitch from Illadelph marches quicker
Nigga not makin sense better stay up off the liquor
Blonde bombshell, car-a-mel, heavy spender
Groups be sayin I'm they sister, hush ya mouth 'fore I hit ya
Stickin in wiseguys, fake thugs, and bullshitters
Take you for a ride, cover up your eye, then I get ya
Used to be shy-er, now I'mma Ruff Ryder
Big niggas play me close, when they used to ride by her
Snatchin up your figures, frontin, know you dig us
Haters, screamin, "who that bitch?"
Mind your business nigga

[Hook]

[Interlude: DJ Clue]
Mad shout out, Donnie Brascoe
Big Skate, Duro

[Verse 5: DMX]
The X is gonna hit y'all niggas hard, leave y'all niggas scarred
Fuckin' with the Dog when you fuckin' with the God
Rip y'all niggas off, faggot niggas soft
Remember me from up North, I had you scared to cough
My name is ringin' bells in penitentiary cells
I'm making thugs rebel, ain't hard to tell
You never really wanted it, so the mic you jumped in front of it
Outta sixteen shots I'mma hit, which one of you niggas am I gonna get
Thought you knew what I was gonna spit, this time with this rhyme
But by the end of it, y'all niggas is gon' be like, "Yo X ripped it!"
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop
Them cats can't be for real, I got this shit locked!
Is that a game or a joke? Say the name or get smoked
Simple as that, simple as black, to the throat
Hit em all up to the coat, now you losin your life
A dog is a dog for life!Mmmmm... Mmmm...
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff ryderz is a family
Ruff ryderz....ruff ryderz...ruff ryderz
Lets go...Swizz!!

Uh
This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit
Hittin wit the hardest shit, cuz before we started shit (uh!)
Wit kidz I knew my fuckin friendz all turned against me (what?)
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this
He got my back I got his, schemin on mad niggas (what?)
Dats how we do bidz (uh!)
It's about time to start another, robbin spree
Cuz yo, my way is highway, robbery
When I was up north since 16 I was sendin niggas home in a coffin (what?)
Livin like a orphan, you bad nigga? (what?)
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here
You know my style will put yo fuckin man, in a wheelchair (c'mon!)
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
Dats how I left him g, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, (woooh!) hit wit da hot one
From the shotgun, catz was close wondered how we got done...

Yo yo, e-v-e
My dogz believe in me
Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit these
Makin moves, second to none, I locked it, huh
Made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double r, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
Cuz I don't wear sunblock
Ask drag if the fire is hot (flame on baby)
Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we comin, then we total the block
We scorn niggas like they mothers, then we wet up they socks
Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out
And buy out bars till we see far
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money?
Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin to hide, then tear out fire
Beat y'alls

Uh, nah, yo, uh, uh, yo, yo
And you can come see me if you tryin to get some
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of em givin me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me
And still end up bein mad cuz I charge 50
And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz
And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget
Like if you spent three you garanteed to make back six
Drove the benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governer off
Even the catz that be hatin still be lovin the dogz
Cuz they know that the double r's comin for war
Wha

Uh-huh
You ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
Cuz when I start bustin the gunz you hidin the kids
And the pieer's still ridin wit clips, survivin wit bricks
We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life
Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face
Gimmie a shank it's holiday(uh)
The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tommorow when they'll probabaly die today
Cuz da pio'll hollow the gunz
Then holla at son (I feel you nigga)
And when he go to holla back, niggas swallowin one

Uh
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot thru the heart like cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's 99, I'm killin you, woman and kid
Fuck scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see
Than the muthafuckaz that y'all see on t.v
And fuck what you heard, check how sheek get down
Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now
You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio
Talkin shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow
I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach
Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match
And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I'll turn niggas more holy man, than eddie murphy
And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in jersey
I got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
Wit some of 6-drop niggas
Revolver pop niggas, easy ox niggas, get knocked
Say I smoked detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin wit the fam and dats word

Hey yo boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
Keep shellz in the envelopes cuz I'll mail out bullets
More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips
Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick
So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top
And double r spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin up, lest they in the wheelchair
Sittin up or spittin up, either way I don't give a fuck[Swizz Beatz]
(mmm, mmmm)
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryders is a family

Red dye, escaping on the red eye, to sea shore
Then hide out and buy out bars till we see fall
In this game, we beat y'all

For eyes be tearin' tryin to i-
Dentify the features!

[JadaKiss]
And you can come see me if you tryin to get some grams tonight
Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin a flight

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
Cuz when I start bustin the guns , you hidin the kids
