[Intro: Billy Blue]
And now Ladies & Gentlemen, Lupe Fiasco
Know you gotta sit there and remember this one, Lupe
Had to get Blue on this track, you feel me?
HOLLA AT 'EM, WHOA
That's all I appreciate right there man
I live for this shit, nigga, you know what I mean
TALK TO 'EM

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Background check for a chopper
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper

[Verse 1: Billy Blue]
I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three muscles recertified
I’m riddin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a Seven Tray in my mama yard, sittin' on D's
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out
Cut the check anyway it come nigga, section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

[Verse 2: Buk of Psychodrama]
(Yeah bitch) Filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it wouldn't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out of sawbuck of loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend up in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper, the barrel
Breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen, you could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching be the person
To be some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them it's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is best for everyone involved
All in all, the Lord my witness

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracka never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yea, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town more often than these bitches emotions
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets (Yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though.. (You gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focussin’ on other environments
Cause the country is taking notice
More fiends are risin', Molly the new dope and I
Apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go ‘blaka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t want a single chain I can’t rocka
Heard em' tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell ‘em I wouldn’t knock her
Til I get that section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yea I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet Mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga health care insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ overseas with they yacht
Shit I probably be the same I find drama
Law’s out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, yo honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '97
And I'm well acquainted with Hell but I’m tryna make it to Heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin’ me
If I don’t get the chopper I’mma probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thinkin’ I was playin’ I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

[Hook]

[Verse 5:  Fam-Lay]
Storm is gone now it’s all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, holies
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Nigas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y’all
You need to think tactical dog
We laughin’ at y’all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
Seein’ this shit that keep goin’ on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin’ that shit we keep blowin’ on

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
I’m bout that, I’m bout that
That Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back
But in luxury I arrive (TURN UP)
IPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex
My Harley got low milage
This white carpet in my project
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant
But I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama
So he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride
Mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit
My weed man on my speed dial

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lupe Fiasco]
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ay, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicare can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up sayin’ "free da guys" like I’m Durk
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop

[Outro][Produced by Sega]

[Intro: 2Pac]
The only way I've been practicing my whole life is to be responsible for what I do. I don't know how to be responsible for what every black male did. I don't know. Yes I am gonna say that I'm a thug, that's because I came from the gutter and I'm still here

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug, I hate payin' taxes
Just hate it, I'm tryna fuck a couple actresses
If I don't got it I'ma make it
Still don't got it, I'ma take it
Run that shit, take your shit, that's what I won't do
Out here doin' what I want to
Nigga you do what you can
That's the difference, I'm a mothafuckin' man
I'm a man, nigga, and as a man I don't take that
I don't do Versace, that's that gay shit
Yeah I said it, I'm a thug
I'm a thug, nigga, guess I need a mothafuckin' hug
Well dig my mama up and tell her give me one
Lotta niggas say they're real, I'm the realest one
I'm the realest, this exactly how I'm feelin', bruh
Ain't no chillin', bruh

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm a mothafuckin' thug (x5)

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone]
It's all about the Benjamins
Nigga, fuck George Zimmerman
How it's pistol versus hand?
Take your whoopin' like a mothafuckin' man
Pussy, damn, how hard can a kid hit?
And why them local rappers ain't did shit?
Lil Wayne said, "Fuck the Heat"
Same local rapper niggas wanted beef
Fun, brother versus brother
No hesitation when you face the same color
None, I'm sayin' what the fuck you niggas stand for?
Guess it's lost in the South, Jim Crow
Still I'm shootin' in the gym
Thinkin' back, shit I couldn't hit the rim
Nigga you should see my game now
If it's a fully, nigga aim down
Let the gun work
Super clean but I've done dirt
Talked the shit until my tongue hurt
And I don't run from skirmishes, nigga

[Hook: Glasses Malone]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself what I'm scared of
How dare the media portray me this way, I can hear the
Crowd screaming, the weirdest of chants, they all in my ear-a
Artist of era, role model I can't
It's like I'm a parrot, apparently I'm marking the dance
I seen done with the devil, such a ghetto romance
How many niggas fall victim, looking at you trapped in the system
Mentally they kept you in prison, and you won't get out, no one visit
Open up your mouth no one listen, you in denial, nigga
I'm in denial with you, I dial dead homies numbers off this liquor
Time and time again I find myself inside the cerebellum
Of several felons, Orion's belt couldn't live in my world
I seen tigers, lions let loose and spooked, I'm next door to Earl
I guess I rely on Jesus to save us before I refer
The madness, my neighbors witness ski masks
The masses don't know
I'm packing this four and harassing your ho
Antagonizing the business you love the most
See the difference to my approach is a 40 ounce at the store
If a forty bounce, to get low
I never learn, I'm hard-headed
The corporate world don't like it, but I said it

[Hook: Glasses Malone]

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] x2
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
God Orion lives in me

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around, all I ever done
Thug, thug, all I ever was
Look around[Verse 1: Ty$]
I got that good dick girl

And if I fuck with you then you shit too
Girl stop playing, what that shit do

That whole team big, getting paper baby
Presidential Rollies and them red bottoms
Anything cheesy but you know I got it, you know I got it
Where the ladies at?
If you got some good pussy baby say yeah yeah, say yeah yeah
If you taste like water let me hear you holla
In the club with the homies popping all the bottles
Dollar sign!

[Bridge: C Ballin]
Now we ain’t going to the bar
Girl you fuckin with a star
I like the way you wearing that skirt
Go on let a nigga go to work
Go to work, go to work

[Hook x2: C Ballin]
Girl I give you that good dick
Girl I give you that good dick
Fuck with me and get some good dick
Girl I give you that good dick
Fuck around, fuck around

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone]
And I, and I put that on the hood
I’ma give it to you good
I’ma do it like you should
Say that pussy death row, call me Suge
Ha! Run it then beat it up
Once you feel it in your stomach then eat it up
And it ain’t no keeping up
She ain’t hitting high notes I ain't deep enough
I go deeper
Million dollar man, this the sleeper
Million dollar dream, you near my Mercedes girl
So when I scoop you baby girl

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
Aye, we can get it in the booth right here
Or we can take it to the coupe
We can do it on the five by the deuce
It’s when I’m in it had lil Mama screaming now woo
Woa, we can get it in the booth
Or we can take you to the coupe
We can do it on the five by the deuce
Go to war on the pussy, better call the troops
That’s the truth, truthfully you never had been
There’s the X’s, why the Z’s like the last letter?
Then I mash like potatoes, I’m a cash getter
Baby blast, never let me down

[Bridge]

[Hook][Intro: Problem]
It's hard for a nigga to say what’s up
Straight up

[Verse 1: Problem]

Yea, it’s my shit my nigga

On the set

[Hook][Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

[Hook][Intro: Glasses Malone & (Lil Wayne)]
Yeah yeah (yessir)
Bad ass blue division, baby (su-woo)
So crazy around here right now nigga (Eastside)
It's like Kobe and Shaq (ya dig?) G and Weezy bitch
Who banging the squad Cash Money the team
Young Money All-Stars muthafuckas
(Young Mula baby!) Pay attention nigga, yeah

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm in the club going dumb something clean out front like uhhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Looking so damn fly sending corks through the sky like ahhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Spend a hundred on my timepiece so if you ain't a dimepiece
Whoa, you know them haterz gon like that
Shit but that just how it goes when a nigga getting dough like ohhh
You know them haterz gon like that

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
Man I let them keep talking as long as muthafucka walking

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I'm a grown ass man, you wanna to see I.D
Filthy rich on the floor fuck V.I.P
Got my hand on my drink other hand on my waist
Two-stepping to the beat I chuck my set in niggas face like ohh
This beat got me bouncing like a check
In my Crown Holder jeans cost a stack on my specs
I'm looking like money if I see it than I'm stacking it
Your wife in my scope and my shot is so accurate
You niggas like activists appealing to the psyche
Man Malone will get it jerkin I 'Just Do It' like Nike
Seein really with the fighting and I'm really with the business
I'm married to the game man God as my Witness

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Weezy F naturally born baby
Prp's, SB's, matching shirt, maybe
White-T, neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the Mob but I'm a bachelor baby
Love is in the air I put on a gas mask
I rather be head first than an ass last
I'm a gorilla call me Sasquatch
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch I'm so hot I'll give your ass a heat rash
Young Money boy I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO like my homie D-Dash
Yeah... we mash like Pac and the Outlaws
And we stand-up and try not to down-fall
I'm trying to reach my goal like a round-ball
Freddy Adu anything for the crown ya'll
Or David Beckham only pay'em or respect'em
Pop one, pop two, bitch I'm on a triple decker
Icicle on my necklace on my cashmere sweater
Keep a shotgun I'm a Hunter like Heather
Yessir shut up and listen to the professor
Or it could get ugly like Esther
Whether in the South or that West Coast weather
I'm popping, Malone and Stockton

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Glasses Malone]
If you got a fly ride put your keys in the sky scream ahhh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If you feeling like a star spend a thousand at the bar scream oooh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If it's hundreds in your pursue ass hiking up your shirt scream ahhh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If your girl is a duck and your hair is whipped up
Scream oooh, you know them haterz gonna like that

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Dropped a hundred on the watch couple hundred on the chain
Whip our front cost half of whole thang
Drop head rows with the automatic doors
Fifty on my pinky twenty five on my hoes
Stunner man been balling since the 80's
Bought fifty whips bought one for my lady
Bet your bottom dollar jewels ain't flaws
Cash Money ball to you fall

[Hook]

[Outro: Birdman]
CMB nigga[Hook: Tyga]
She ain't playing, not a bit

She bounce that ass, till' a nigga get dizzy
My, my, my bitch get busy, busy, busy
My, my, my bitch get busy, busy, busy
(Look at her go)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
All eyes on her
In that ? skirt
Matchin with the ? purse
Gotta coordinate, dropped a quarter on her hair
Drop it in my lap, let a nigga know it's real
See all stacked up, lil' momma know the deal
Baby beat it up, ivander holyfield
Get hoes in these churches just for actin' like a ho
Only rap nigga out in traffic in the fo' like it's 1994
When i parolled outta ?

'fuck you mean?
And ever since I got the gs, that bitch like fuck recess

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Drop, drop it on the floo'
You know I'm high as fuck bitch, keep it on the low
She give me good head, call that shit sloppy joe
I'm the shit, smell chanel cologne send it all to go
Westside, fat ass I get behind her
I'm in the pussy all night like a fucking dina
Nosey ass pinocchio, rappers be quiet
Say you getting more money than me, you a liar
Killing shit, gangster attire, bitches admire
You sweet as papaya, bandana and the ties
Life in the game don't jeopardize it
I'm the truth, put that on Zion
T-Rah, shit!

[Hook: Tyga][Intro: Huey]
(Gun shots) Let's go!
The fuck it is, nigga
H.I.T.Z. Committee, ya dig?
This what the fuck we do, man
From Que Records, to C.B.E.N.T
To the 9-Factor, to mother fucking Trillion Billion Dollar Beats
This is what we do!

[Hook]
24/7-365 on my grind, cause I, I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine [x2]
How you gon' do it, nigga?
(One) Hustle hard nigga, (Two) Stack paper, (Three) Cut the line nigga, (Four) Watch haters
(One) Hustle hard nigga, (Two) Stack paper, 24/7-365 on my grind

[Verse 1: Huey]
Since I grind, these niggas have lost they mind
Hating because I shine from family to all-kind
That's 24/7, everyday of the year
Everyday I am here, I gon' make shit clear
Fuck you, fuck whoever got something to say
'Bout how I handle my business, I'm a do it my way
I am young, I am smart, never small with some heart
I can just taste my money when I hit the airport
You next to overseas, I can smell the palm trees
Guess I'm just a grasshopper, attracted to all green
Now listen to Al Green to bring out the old days
Wishing O.G.'s was still stuck into they old ways
No snitches, no bitching, getting digits by the hour
Ignore the phrase, "More money more power"
As a Mama's boy I hate to see Mama cry
So 24/7 - 365 on my grind, know why?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maino]
(Listen) Now I'm a get it, I get it until my numbers call
So I'm just a name and a memory on my homie's wall
I be movin' O's, I'm tryna just build my dough up
So I'm just a slab in a Corrimal with my toes up
Niggas deal with jealousy, baby how can they hate on me
I'm a keep it thorough I'm not, not a celebrity
I'm real like a Phoenix Sun, feel like my day is coming
If I can just kill competition, then all the fees will come
You can't stunt on I, the whole Summer's mine
(Hi Hater) Got the country waving hi and bye
Brooklyn to Saint Lou, Brooklyn we can't lose
It's hustle hard, I'm a get it til' I can't move

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
It's the waterboy, we keep them bottles Jack
I tell them haters bye, twist it hard and throttle back
What they talking, dollas? We got a lot of that
Cash Money Million, now go and swallow that
Tricks make it rain, we don't carry ones
I'm from 7th Street, now nigga where you from?
It's a gang thang, can't it money counters
All we do is slang, and pray on out-of-towners
Ask around, homie, we some chain-checkers
And we are not the same, so lame run yo' necklace
It's a new West, the whole game respect us
And fuck these old rappers, since they won't accept us
Ask around, G., A clown we spit them breezy raps
And I would trade you nigga's life to bring Eazy back
Man, you niggas wack, you got to coach a dime
I'm 'bout to bring us back, look like the coast is mine

[Hook][Intro: Will.I.Am]
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh, haha, oh!
Oh, haha, oh!

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
Kill a California nigga, palm trees and poverty
East side, wild city; got my block with me
Bags of that kush, big bottles, sip a lot of Henny
In the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
Nothing but a B thang, show you where we bang (Nickerson!)
Hurry on the grind, getting Benjamins
Yeah, we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
Keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
Death around the corner, you don't want to meet the reaper
All we know is Blood money, we ain't never had a visa
Trying to wade in that reefer, only thing that could feed us
Had the ghetto with my Bloods since the days of a fetus
Raised by the streets, so it's nothing you can teach us
Bring the word like a preacher
Jay Rock a.k.a bring the real to the people

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto, g-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I'm on top, ain't no one stop me yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot and get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
They say the boy beast on the mic, like whoa
When the homies show him love? Like, everywhere he go
Black rag up the back pocket, different than the 'fo
West coast till I'm gone, I'm here to let you niggas know
Eastwood in this motherfucker, swanging like a [warner?]
Even if I have to push a couple rocks on the corner
I posted on the corner, blowing that marijuana
With a loaded .45, for haters that really want it

[Verse 3: Omar Cruz]
Not  just because you [?] guns
Living that thug life, cause only homies show me love
What you expect from us? All we know is the hood and drugs
It was the debt on us, that's why they keep us in the slums
But I was built in [?], in the ghetto (stop)
Why go to war, when they shoot me here like Papa Rock
I gotta make it out cause nobody else will
And momma love to see me up in XXL (Oh cool!)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
You niggas know who it is, and it's easy to see (yeah)
Number-one emcee, it ain't easy to be (nah)
Twin Glock ain't show when I'm speaking the flows
Get snobbish on a bitch, I ain't speaking to hoes (bitch!)
Still grinding every day, stay puffing a blunt
Cops are robbing, (hell no!) we play Crips and Bloods
Make it rain on the streets, still make it flood
(ScHoolboy Q!) Yeah, roll out the rug

[Verse 5: Ab-Soul]
Ab-Soul, what you gonna tell me
I ain't trying to see the grave, I'm just want to get paid
In full, like ace till momma's straight
And if I go to jail, tell mom I'm straight
Cause I, chose this life, and now I lead it
Got too rich - got two cents? Keep it
Cause you might need it, more than I
All My Life Remix, brought to you by:

[Hook]

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
This what you doing for town, huh Rock
Watts that's what it do, Watts stand up
All My Life, yeah I've been waiting for this

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
No Rocka-fella had me pissed off
[?], make the pain get lost
Now I'm popping on the charge, like a tube of lip gloss
Breaking old niggas off, like I'm hella Rick Ross
Scream "New West" had everybody pounding
Like I give a fuck, tell them do something about it
Waited my turn, yeah feel my buzz
Now it's me and Jay Rock, and all eyes on us, uh

[Verse 7: Crooked I]
I, I, I know you coppers expect me to fail
Oh well, I'm living life on the executive scale
You want to do me like Sean Bell, never spend a second in jail
Go to hell, i got records to sell
Me and Jay Rock, getting this cheese
You can ask my homie Adolf, he wrecked them niggas in [?]
I'm in Long Beach, feeling the breeze
Nobody graduated on my block, it's still is a million degrees

[Verse 8: Nipsey Hussle]
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on a block, blue collar wasn't me
My momma put me out, and I would step up in the streets
But I ain't mad at her, cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the "Fuck The Police!"
We [?] pick you up and drop you off down the street
And say I'm too street and pay bitches on these beats
But they all ever seem to hear is all red [?]

[Verse 9: Sinful]
Vamos, todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
Long Beach California vecinos de Watts
Mira como abrazo el [?]
Y ahora mira lo que toque, yo
No más pistolas y rosas, no
No más [?] con fácil copas, no
Aprendí si no hay [?] nadie avanza
El barrio nos [?] [chansas] y [los] [planchas]
Amor a las calles, que me criaron a mi
A ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
Fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
Mucha sangre, mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
El esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
El mejor secreto guardado por cierto
Descanso con un ojo despierto
Silencio soy el águila del [?]

[Verse 10: Ya Boy]
I used to Christmas shop in the dollar store
And let a boy spend guap at the Prada store
I gotta, thank God for my rhyming though
Beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
And I ain't trying to say I got it honest though, cause
I was right there at that corner store
I had it all - from the pills to the pot to blow
I even had cream, like Rocky Road
I thought getting out the hood was impossible
That's all I know, I ain't that responsible
So I'ma stay right here, where it's logical
And I can buy this twenty-fives in popsicles
All of a sudden, this rap got popping though
Heard he rap, but he look so rock-n-roll
Call me Ya Boy, who better? Cause I got the note
If you ain't talking money, then I got to go. Bye!

[Verse 11: Roccett]
Pass to the streets, I done mastered rap
Got the black bandana with the strap to match
Got the blue bandana with the Chucks to go
As I rock throwback like the huxtables
Man, Carson too rich, you can head to the pack
We made a name down there, and they'll vouch for that
You can go ask Jeezy, or go and ask Puff
Go and ask Kan, I grind for mine

[Verse 12: T.K.]
I got a sick swagger, short as a dagger knife
I'ma send us to the beach, just for bragging rights
My whip lean, my shoes clean
Diamond watch, low-key
All sip, mint green
Doing my thing, in the fast lane man
I'm Terry Wayne Kennedy, you niggas [?] don't fronting me
I've been trying to be telling you niggas that be killing me? You need to stop it

[Verse 13: Problem]
(You got it back, huh?) Guess who's mad in the game?
I got a new deal, so I bought me a chain
I know it weren't smart but fuck it it's gone
Marshmallow-sized rocks, got the luckiest charm
Pitching for the top, like I've stuck it all
Look like new waves but I' stuck them home
Niggas want to creep when they think you on
So the heat stay around me like I'm stuck in a stove, my lord!

[Hook]

[Verse 14: Young Keno]
(I feel you Jay)
I came from a single-parent home, mom did all the dirty work
Only good day is when we could hear the birdies chirp
And even though I moved a little  work
I still suited up for a Sunday at Church
Then back to the block, to diss a few [packs?]
Damn, it felt good to count a few stacks
This day and night though, I know it ain't right
But down in the hood, man, this is our life

[Verse 15: Spider Loc]
I won't lie on y'all, my only concern, is y'all don't lie on me
My speech slurred, cause I'm buzzin'
Jay Rock, they hatin' cause I'm buzzin', cousin
And the blue rag kicking it harder, but the red shit sticking in water
Both feet [?] hard on the angle
Hood on the back [?], stars on the ankle

[Hook]

[Verse 16: 211]
Product of the block, young rider from the block
Used to run on 'em niggas, [?] rob them with the Glock
In the hood we the mind workers, hood like a job
Got my enemies hot, cause I made a [?]
We from ashy to classy, no jewels to flashing
Hundred thousand dollars but still wearing khakis
I'm a, i'm a hustler, I get it from my daddy
I heard the [?] want me, they gon' have to come and catch it

[Verse 17: Bangloose]
Yeah, yeah I'm at the top now, haters hate to see me popping
What's now? From the Fronts to the George Downs?
I'm on fire, that means that I'm high man
I'm so cocky, you wish you could be [Bane?]
You can't stop me, I live like the gutter lane
Banging you so tight, like a [bike chain?]
You done fucked up, yelling by the poolside
Yeah, [?] socks, [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 18: Mistah F.A.B.]
Listen to the pain of a real crack baby
My daddy died, now he ain't coming back baby
Momma be stressing, I told her I was blessed
So worried for Christmas, she bought me a present
My brother smoke coke, my sister on dope
My little nigga's driving, they tired of being broke
In and out of jail, I'm living in hell!
Little girl got raped, and she ain't even yell!

[Verse 19: Roscoe Umali]
Came from nothing, rose from slums
Now your boy Roscoe doing shows out in London
Ain't that something? Your boy been hustling
End of the day, can't say nothing from 'em
God damn, I'm a good ass rapper
Half these wack rappers is some good actors
Seen them on TV, and be lie that's gangsta
But in real life, they ain't shit - they can't spit

Yeah, you heard of pride up before destruction
That's cause we done cut more hide up than alien abduction

More suction on my gun than a vacuum
Obstruction
Of justice on the run
In the back room
Ever since the crack boom, prostitutes callin'
Gangstas do they thang from Watts and we be ballin'

Repeat Chorus[Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Intro: Billy Blue]
And now Ladies & Gentlemen, Lupe Fiasco
Know you gotta sit there and remember this one, Lupe
Had to get Blue on this track, you feel me?
HOLLA AT 'EM, WHOA
That's all I appreciate right there man
I live for this shit, nigga, you know what I mean
TALK TO 'EM

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Car cosigned by my mama
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Filet mignon with my food stamps
Background check for a chopper
Medical card from Obama
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper
Background check for a chopper

[Verse 1: Billy Blue]
I got my chopper full and my black tee, slide
My baby mama done fucked up on her food stamps
That’s three muscles recertified
I’m riddin', niggas be watching, they don’t want these problems
When them bills due, niggas get ready cause no bullshit I’m plottin'
I’m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese
Got a Seven Tray in my mama yard, sittin' on D's
I’m bout this fee, I’m bout this fee, just know what’s free
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth so don’t critique
Look at me nigga, just a young hood nigga tryna get this cake
I don’t need to be givin’ out how school gon’ educate
Filet mignon for my food stamps I know mama credit quite good
So I’m out here with this dope money got a big body in my hood
Nigga you see it, better believe it, this what I’m bout
Got a trap house I be boomin’ in, fiends in and out
Cut the check anyway it come nigga, section 8
See we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha

[Verse 2: Buk of Psychodrama]
(Yeah bitch) Filet mignon with my food stamps
Would tell you I don’t but it wouldn't be the truth
Let me hit you back on my government phone
Still a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?
We get a blunt and a joint out of sawbuck of loud
Where I’m from we be actually hoopin’ in Jordans
Five dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes
Ain’t nobody finna do shit important
People really don’t give no fuck about nothing
Although they may smile and be cordial
Dealin’ around with the wrong damn crowd
Then bring a frown to my friend up in an alley, we warned you
Background check for the chopper, the barrel
Breathin' back down the neck of imposters
The murder rate ain’t back down yet
Cause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say somethin’
Some people, listen, you could be predisposed or be preconditioned
Or speak with the preacher, been preaching be the person
To be some process in your progress or be the prevention
I just live my life and I don’t stop grindin’ until God tell me to
I get money, I ain’t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?
They say my kind ain’t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that
But those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them it's still a fact
So mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine
You’ll solve you'll find that this is best for everyone involved
All in all, the Lord my witness

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trouble]
Permit, don’t need permission from a doctor
I been smokin’ since a pre-teen toddler
I been servin’ since a jit tryna dodge all the obstacles
My teachers all told me that were probable
Probable cause, no cracka never really had it
I was just a nigga in a high price whip
Yea, I’m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto
Well you better have extension on the clip
Well beef comes around in the town more often than these bitches emotions
I got a yapper, five dollars, off the streets (Yeah I'm totin')
For protection more than anything though.. (You gon' test my devotion)
My first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken
Chicago violence boostin’ up but we just focussin’ on other environments
Cause the country is taking notice
More fiends are risin', Molly the new dope and I
Apologize cause it was something I was promotin’
Chopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up
You just tell them it was stolen
Rich gunplay, shit that’s all they see that’s all they know
Without it kinda hopeless
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background
Said this is in ’09 and still no medicare for grandma
I done said out their names and niggas still ain't want no anna
Lu probably tell me Trouble you gotta put the mack down
Felonies all in your background

[Verse 4: Trae tha Truth]
I used to run up in your crib with shit that go ‘blaka
Nigga tryna brick my squad like I’m Waka
I don’t want a single chain I can’t rocka
Heard em' tell me life is a bitch, can’t stop her
Even if I could, I tell ‘em I wouldn’t knock her
Til I get that section 8 and then swap her
Baby mama tax return, new dropper
I might wanna go silk that bitch like I’m Shocker
All of my whips wetter than a water house
Food stamps getting flipped, what that water cost?
Yea I’m actin like a nigga that ain’t never had shit
Filet Mignon, porterhouse
My little brother on his medical shit from that block street
Nigga health care insured by that guap
Doorways ain't hiding me, no stop
Jackers playin’ overseas with they yacht
Shit I probably be the same I find drama
Law’s out lookin’ for me like Osama
I don’t wanna do no bid, yo honor
Still waitin’ on my one phone call from Obama
Tell ‘em I need the chopper, they tellin’ me I'm a felon
I'm tellin' 'em they got it wrong, I beat the case in '97
And I'm well acquainted with Hell but I’m tryna make it to Heaven
But they don’t want me to make it, that’s why the niggas be tellin’ me
If I don’t get the chopper I’mma probably run up inside them
They better gimme a answer, I’m tryna be cool
If I don’t get it then everybody gon’ fear it
Every week I’m finna make ‘em repeat it like they in school
Bed blues, everybody open up somethin’
You can move all you want just not sudden
It ain’t no thinkin’ I was playin’ I am not frontin'
The mentality of a goon, I am not stuntin'

[Hook]

[Verse 5:  Fam-Lay]
Storm is gone now it’s all clear
The road was long but we all here
Now go and tell, I don’t care
2014 is our year
Big shout out to the whole streets
This goes out to all that knows me
All y’all pussy niggas, holies
Y’all play tough guys but call the police
Look I don’t care, I don’t share
I keep me a bad bitch with long hair
I send them choppers around there
When I’m somewhere sittin’ in a lounge chair
Overseas, blowin’ tree, blowin’ green, throwin’ B's
Livin’ like life is supposed to be
And if you wanna see it all, nigga roll with me
To the top, couldn’t stop, had a major deal but it wouldn’t pop
Nigas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop
And now life sweeter than a puddin’ pop
Think so slick, come and get me dog
None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog
Some of y’all niggas comin’ with me dog
None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog
You think an echo was y’all
You need to think tactical dog
We laughin’ at y’all
While you thinking me and Lu radical, naw
Seein’ this shit that keep goin’ on
Then pick a different zone for your mobile homes
Store fingerprints on your mobile phone
When you sippin’ that shit we keep blowin’ on

[Verse 6: Glasses Malone]
I’m bout that, I’m bout that
That Bentley out in that driveway
Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m gettin’ back
But in luxury I arrive (TURN UP)
IPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus on that bullshit
But a real nigga can’t judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex
My Harley got low milage
This white carpet in my project
30 guns in my section, none of the homies got aim
My side bitch said she pregnant
But I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
I ain’t claimin’ shit but the game
And this one is mine, I don’t trust his mama
So he don’t got my name
Cheap rims on  my ride
Mirrors loose as my beat pound
I ain’t addicted to shit
My weed man on my speed dial

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lupe Fiasco]
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ay, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the muthafucka from a cop
Ay, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Excuse me, as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicare can’t heal us
And the mamas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up sayin’ "free da guys" like I’m Durk
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop

[Outro][Produced by: The Antidote & King Dave]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Twisted off the herb
Kush got me lifted like some hands up in church
26 inches, sittin' off the curb
Big money make a killin' when I kill 'em with my verbs
But haters wanna talk, tryin' to work my nerves
Pay 'em no mind I just hit 'em where it hurts
The gutter's in my blood, know i came from the dirt
Step up in the place, not a stain on his shirt
Don't try to jack, or things'll get worse
You don't really wanna see this mac 10 emerge
Might be at a bar, drinkin' like a fish
Baby wanna swallow so I might grant her wish
Down, spent a lot of dollars on this fit
Struttin' like a pimp, see the guccis on his kicks
I know the niggas jealous of a kid
That's why I keep them uzis in the whip don't trip

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Don't make a mothafucker pull the tool out
Or everybody's laid out like a luau
Don't make a nigga make the news now
You fly lookin' for somethin' to shoot down
You niggas think I'm insane (insane)
You think I lost my brain (my brain)
[Glasses Malone]
And I could give a fuck about your whits
Imma tell you like this
Only dollars make sense

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
You niggas better recognize
I can hop out and spray like a sector side
A hundred rounds'll have your whole hood petrified
Pull up, push on niggas for the exercise
It's a chain, why you worried 'bout your necklace size?
Niggas 'round the corner waitin' just to snatch it
Hit you with the ratchets, they do it for the practice
Know a ten year old that'll come and bring you the casket
It's live or die, drinkin' liquor 'till my liver fries
Imma G, you can see through any given eye
On any given Sunday, a nigga sinnin' heavy
In the city with the water, never broke a levy
You mothafuckers ain't ready
I'm hot like the Serengeti, so deadly
Still jealous of a kid
That's why I keep them uzis in the whip don't trip

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
I'm 'bout fed up with this rap shit
And Rock the only dude I wanna rap with
Rest of y'all, shit, a nigga wanna scrap with
You bitches lights, camera, action like an actress
Fact is, I'm just tired of directing
Now, when I yell shoot, there's bullets flyin' your direction
Ground covered in blood stains and mac shells
Then I ride off in the cut ti bumpin' mac swells
It's Watts where prop. look is rat tail
Shit, the only thing up is the crack sales
So I invest, stocks in the streets
Let the fans worry 'bout 'em, beach cruisin' get release
You see this water, and this white is my relief
Imma pump, pump, pump 'till my heart cease to beat
I know y'all jealous of a crip
That's why I keep them uzis in the six, don't trip bitch

[Hook][Hook: Tyga]
She ain't playing, not a bit
She don't fuck around, she with the shit
She bounce that ass, till' a nigga get dizzy
My, my, my bitch get busy, busy, busy
My, my, my bitch get busy, busy, busy
(Look at her go)

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
All eyes on her
In that ? skirt
Matchin with the ? purse
Gotta coordinate, dropped a quarter on her hair
Drop it in my lap, let a nigga know it's real
See all stacked up, lil' momma know the deal
Baby beat it up, ivander holyfield
Get hoes in these churches just for actin' like a ho
Only rap nigga out in traffic in the fo' like it's 1994
When i parolled outta ?
? young glasses don't ?
'fuck you mean?
And ever since I got the gs, that bitch like fuck recess

[Hook: Tyga]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Drop, drop it on the floo'
You know I'm high as fuck bitch, keep it on the low
She give me good head, call that shit sloppy joe
I'm the shit, smell chanel cologne send it all to go
Westside, fat ass I get behind her
I'm in the pussy all night like a fucking dina
Nosey ass pinocchio, rappers be quiet
Say you getting more money than me, you a liar
Killing shit, gangster attire, bitches admire
You sweet as papaya, bandana and the ties
Life in the game don't jeopardize it
I'm the truth, put that on Zion
T-Rah, shit!

[Hook: Tyga][Intro]

[Verse 1: Ricky Rude]
I'm on my way, yeah, to getting my dough up now
I got this chick from Uptown doing the up-down
And when I touch down, you better duck down
Cause when I clap clap, there's no clap back
And fuck Jordan's man, and fuck snapbacks
I wear boots man, and drive classics
I'mma class act, bitch pass that
I'mma do my numbers: NASDAQ
I attack tracks, smoke outta gas masks
And if I crash that, I'll just laugh black
Where the cash at? You better tap Mac
Or get opened up like a fucking hatchback
And that's an exact fact

[Verse 2: Ricky Rude]
I'm too high for fuck-tion so I'm getting suction
At a public function I'll be smashing like Pumpkins
So for now, just keep sucking it, just don't bite down
I'm fucking the bitch - ass up, face down
I'm juggling six girlfriends right now
I'm smuggling six piff pounds right now
Going to the top, they're like "quick, Rick, get down"
I'm like kill yourself, here's a shovel, dig down
Cause motherfucker I stay around people with good news
And motherfucker I stay in places with good views
I'm just a good dude, you caught me in a good mood
I am so Jersey, I am so rude
Now that might be an oxy-fucking-moron
But we grew up selling the Oxys to morons
So of course things are good and all appreciated
Bitch we made it
Only way to fight fear is to face it
No guts, no glory, that's just my story
I would say hi hater, But I'm too high hater
I'll be in Dubai later, with all my paper
With no fucking neighbors
I'll see you fuckers later[Intro: Glasses Malone & (Lil Wayne)]
Yeah yeah (yessir)
Bad ass blue division, baby (su-woo)
So crazy around here right now nigga (Eastside)
It's like Kobe and Shaq (ya dig?) G and Weezy bitch
Who banging the squad Cash Money the team
Young Money All-Stars muthafuckas
(Young Mula baby!) Pay attention nigga, yeah

[Hook: Glasses Malone]
I'm in the club going dumb something clean out front like uhhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Looking so damn fly sending corks through the sky like ahhh
You know them haterz gon like that
Spend a hundred on my timepiece so if you ain't a dimepiece
Whoa, you know them haterz gon like that
Shit but that just how it goes when a nigga getting dough like ohhh
You know them haterz gon like that

[Bridge: Glasses Malone]
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
I hear you talking hater but you ain't saying nothing
Man I let them keep talking as long as muthafucka walking

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
I'm a grown ass man, you wanna to see I.D
Filthy rich on the floor fuck V.I.P
Got my hand on my drink other hand on my waist
Two-stepping to the beat I chuck my set in niggas face like ohh
This beat got me bouncing like a check
In my Crown Holder jeans cost a stack on my specs
I'm looking like money if I see it than I'm stacking it
Your wife in my scope and my shot is so accurate
You niggas like activists appealing to the psyche
Man Malone will get it jerkin I 'Just Do It' like Nike
Seein really with the fighting and I'm really with the business
I'm married to the game man God as my Witness

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Weezy F naturally born baby
Prp's, SB's, matching shirt, maybe
White-T, neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the Mob but I'm a bachelor baby
Love is in the air I put on a gas mask
I rather be head first than an ass last
I'm a gorilla call me Sasquatch
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch I'm so hot I'll give your ass a heat rash
Young Money boy I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO like my homie D-Dash
Yeah... we mash like Pac and the Outlaws
And we stand-up and try not to down-fall
I'm trying to reach my goal like a round-ball
Freddy Adu anything for the crown ya'll
Or David Beckham only pay'em or respect'em
Pop one, pop two, bitch I'm on a triple decker
Icicle on my necklace on my cashmere sweater
Keep a shotgun I'm a Hunter like Heather
Yessir shut up and listen to the professor
Or it could get ugly like Esther
Whether in the South or that West Coast weather
I'm popping, Malone and Stockton

[Hook]

[Bridge 2: Glasses Malone]
If you got a fly ride put your keys in the sky scream ahhh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If you feeling like a star spend a thousand at the bar scream oooh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If it's hundreds in your pursue ass hiking up your shirt scream ahhh
You know them haterz gonna like that
If your girl is a duck and your hair is whipped up
Scream oooh, you know them haterz gonna like that

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Dropped a hundred on the watch couple hundred on the chain
Whip our front cost half of whole thang
Drop head rows with the automatic doors
Fifty on my pinky twenty five on my hoes
Stunner man been balling since the 80's
Bought fifty whips bought one for my lady
Bet your bottom dollar jewels ain't flaws
Cash Money ball to you fall

[Hook]

[Outro: Birdman]
CMB nigga[Intro: Glasses Malone]
Yeah
It's only right that you hear from the hometown hero
Capital!
G-mothafuckin' Malone
Badass blue vision

[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Check, I do it for the Eastside
Mad ass Eastside
Only drag and saggin', breathe in and leave the beach fried
That's from Watts, I could never let you geeks slide
Cobbler to this fat boy, y'all see this peach pride
And that's the difference, ain't nothin' soft about me
Not only Watts but Compton, shit, they all be lost without me
So how can niggas doubt me?
Came at ya [?]
Gone it, we was dumpin' water like the fountains
Couple men accountin', when 100 dollars off of council
Who could cancel any nigga with diarrhea of the tonsils
Your family mourning like Alonsle when we shoot
That's how Watts raised us; like pigeons in the coop
Some of us fly away, others land on the roof
Or get locked in the cave, when the eagles come to swoop
So this for every crip, or every nigga that sawoop
And I feel like a soldier, so when you see me just salute

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
It's Jay Rock
Watts finest
Top Dawg Entertainment! Yeah!
When I say shit I just want the people to feel me, you feel me?

From my hometown to yours
Lead brings showers, when it rains, it pours
I'm really from the bricks, projects to be Pacific
In the spot with the pots and pans, whippin' like a chemist
I remember the day, when my momma started trippin'
Told her a hustle is all I know, I gotta make me a livin'
Pitchin' nickle and dime rocks
Bitch niggas was dissin'
Tell I got me a 9-shot, catchin' niggas slippin', flip 'em
Them was them good ol' gutter days
Sittin' im my Regal rolling big ol' blunts to blaze
Then gettin' high 'till I'm touching them clouds
A lot of shit up on my mind, is what prevent me to smile
These wicked streets, the reason my heart cold
I guess I'm just another lost soul
Which means I'm gonna search for the crossroads
Stay with my cross homes
You cross me, you're crossin' the grounds I walk on, Watts! Nigga

[Verse 3: X.O.]
You mothafuckers know what it is man
Black Wall-street up in this bitch
Yeah, X.O

I'm so inspired
Growin' through the mileage
Move through the solar system with no co-pilot
Born a mark man, God was so bias
And I swore to him I was born to be Galilee
Came from the gutter, a wild little nigga
Missin' piece to a puzzle, still trying to see the picture
2 parent home, but the hood made me smarter
Cali's full of nothin' but [?]
Maurter, may say I'm the last of the greats
Old heads seem bulimic, they need to pass the plate
I'm hip hop's bastard, I need to pass the mase
Or reverend Al just Jesse Jackson castrates
Pass the hate, plus the bullets do me
Shoot me, before you hit another young, black teen
Seems, nothin' in life is certain but death
That, and Imma always be a killer for the west
For my hometown[Verse 1: Glasses Malone]
Started A, skipped to see who wanna be you
It's a V-12, roof is see through
You know how G do, slow my swagger down
Then screw my swagger up, then load the mac with rounds
Then I hit your block, you better hit the house
I'll change that magazine, soon as this clip is out
You niggas talkin' bad, don't get to trippin' out
Cause yo daddy catch the blues, you know the crips is out
And we get nasty homie, just like a stripper's mouth
Wash them oil stains, cause once you slip it's pow
Noodles in your lap, sauce is on your seat
G is on the mic, Rotem on the beat
What it do, this how it's gotta be
Make 'em wash they mouth, ?
Now tell 'em squash the beef, they know my squad is deep
Or watch 'em play the pussy, I'll make 'em squat to pee

[Hook: Young Lace]
No, no, I do not see you
Started A and skipped the C cause I don't wanna be you
No, no, I do not see you
I started A and skipped the C cause I don't wanna be you
No, no, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Started A and skipped the C cause I don't wanna be you

[Verse 2: Young Lace]
Big money speakin', I leave a nigga leakin'
Call me Nyquil cause I'll be leavin' niggas sleepin'
What is you thinkin'? Rappin' is my comfort
I'm gettin' that green, you can call it cucumbers
Crazy lifestyle, Evel Kinevel
My gun goes pop, there goes the weasle
I'm leavin' haters on the cement
Any given Sunday, now call me Willie Beamen
I stay schemin' and plottin'
On my next buck, I don't really give a fuck like I'm Rodman
I got wordplay, keep yah head bobbin'
And fuck a price tag, if I want it then I'm coppin'
Yeah, a nigga got a lot of leverage
I'm gettin' money, gettin' money is my heritage
I don't give a shit and I don't give a fuck either
I'm kinda like Nas, I be spittin' that ether

[Hook: Young Lace]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
They've done cleared the planes for takeoff
So y'all gon' need to go hard or keep your day job
I'm on the same shit them rich niggas on
Backseat, playin' Xbox, Jordan slippers on
Sippin rose, smell the kush cologne
Tell 'em I need ESPN and ?
I get money, I'm grown
So I walk inside the bank like, "Honey I'm home"
And I'm the pilot so they call me cocky
Pocket full of presidents, the ones you see without the body
I'm gettin' face, I'm switchin' states
Sayin' prayers for my dog, I hope he whips his case
I set the pace, you follow suit
From the streets but I party where all the models do
If your friend's sexy, call her too
And skip past A and B, just let a nigga see all of you

[Hook: Young Lace]

[Verse 4: Guyana]
Two car garage, two cars inside
Two more in my driveway that I don't ever drive
Ten flatscreens in my crib, I'm in the backseat of my whip
I got a chauffeur in my Maybach that I pay stacks cause I'm rich
Got more glasses than Malone, gotta walk around with two phones
Cause them hoes won't leave me alone, got more cars than you've got clothes
Wiz wanna be my roommate, Louie V on my suitcase
You get the picture, Blu-Ray, I'm the one, you're too late
Doin' shit that's illegal, my connect is a chico
Take your money, repo, you rappers suck, deep throat
I'm not the same as you cheap hoes, those people that need dough
You walk around doin' free shows, I'm ballin', Tim Tebow

[Hook: Young Lace][Intro: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, got my nigga G Malone here, see he a g too
He understand what it be like
See I just wanna throw my swag on really
But Top and Punch, they just wanna see a nigga laid back
You know what I mean? Laid back

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
You imaginary niggas perplex me
You should see the corny shit they do to impress me
Actin' like bitches backstage who wanna sex me
Or baseball gloves all day tryin' to catch me
I run it like a track meet, but you never met me
Attract heat like black clothes or crack co-caine
My brain on the grain like a veggie (I'm uncomfortable dog)
You irritatin' like a wedgie
In particular I'm a don, mega like the maker of Friday
With nothin' to do and no job
This chrome that I hold will leave you holy like you know God
Sin City, murder in abundance
Where mothers look like they always smell onions
Ride by the elementary and kids cussin'
And it's nothin' new to us you could do to us
So get your weapon or player just get to steppin' up the stairway to heaven

[Hook]
I'm a g from the floor
All the way up to the LA fitted up on my dome
They won't leave me alone (And I know)
You can't resist (And you don't)
Even exist
I see right through you niggas just like a ghost
Cause I'm a g for sure

[Verse 2: Glasses Malone]
They say I talk big shit
I can't help it, I'm on my sixth whip
[?] gotta say some slick shit
I'm so screwed up just like a [?]
Bobby B, I used to pitch sticks
Every pour I was forced just to take a few whiffs
That's why I'm part eclectic
High all the time and my art reflects it
[?] while we spark detectives
And money can't even get you marks accepted
You need to chill with the g talk
Cause half you rap bloods used to sea walk
Now all the fuckin' sudden you's a b dog
I been bangin' since hangin' by the seesaw
Niggas think bloodin' is a fad, on crip
Got my real blood homies lookin' bad

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Naw, I ain't into the tough talk
From the 1950's where we'd rather let our guns spark
Chill with your colored scarf, shots take your caps off
Close range with the burner, nigga, 'til your skull [?]
Get with shit, Top Dawg's one and only blue pit
All black four fifth dumpin' at your loose lips
Yeah I'm trippin', best believe a nigga crippin'
I'd even rob Obama if I catch the nigga slippin'
Catch a nigga dippin' nigga
Ridin' through the fifties on chucks lookin' crispy
Man I wish a nigga tempt me nigga
Bustin' 'til it's empty, done with the plan
Need to take a trip to hell and have the devil start prayin'
Hammer start sprayin', lead into my rifle
Make a nigga bleed just for fuckin' with my cycle
Bigger than the Eiffel
Tower, havin' power niggas softer than a flower
Time to make these cats devour

[Hook]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
Yeah homie, you already know how it's goin' homie
It's west coast homie, best coast homie, better smoke
Know what I'm sayin', left side of the map, know what I'm sayin'
Straight up, come to the hood, fuck with us
Know what I'm sayin', straight up
I be at the Del Amo Swap Meet right now
With the corduroy house slippers on with the back folded down under the
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, hey pass me a bigger rip[Verse 1: Trizz]
California nigga this is what I represent
Hailing from the southern side
But i'm heaven sent
Red rags
Blue flags
We affiliated
Gang bang where i'm from
This is where it originated
They call me Young Trizz
Newest artist from the west
I'm so sure about my rep
Tat it on my flesh
If you don't know about me yet
You technically in debt
So pay the price and buy my album
To produce my check
The youngest on my coast
Same chronic different smoke
Seventeen with a style
Unpredictable
I'm invincible to those with no principles
To serve a purpose in this game
Serve you critical
Compton's in my veins
That's how I got the heart in me
The elements to
I feel it in my arteries
Touch down in my state past the line of scrimmage
You won't make it out alive without a death sentence

[Chorus]
Propose a toast where I represent
And do the most
The far left
Better known as the west coast
This is life
Not a fad, fashion, or a trend
We ain't kidding
New west let the games begin
(x2)

[Glasses Malone]
We re-up
So go on
Let the fiends in
The only star
From the California king pin
Watts California king fam
I was ran by Watts California king Cam
My motherfucking kingdom is the East
Niggas gotta play every time he try and eat
It's not a threat
More like protection
Wolf gets buried without the pack leaders blessing
So real shit
Take heed to the message
Because if they start attacking
Ain't no coming to the rescue
They going to rip you up something special
And if that don't do it
Heart will cardiac arrest you
West coast better known as the jungle
Service I provide
On the side
Gonna run you
Or you can take a gamble like some do
And end up the main story on the channel 1 news

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Trizz]
I was born in this west life
Consider it the best life
Money taking over
I'm a victim to the stressed life
Still hold my own
Keep it G like Malone
Getting gangster on these song lyrics
Killing off the dome
Raised to carry a chrome
If you violate my zone
Shoot first
Ask last
California is my home
Cold on the track
But i'm hot as Arizona
The west ain't dead
It's just in a slight coma
Got a word for the East
The Midwest, and the South
With all do respect
Keep the west out your mouth
I'm here to kill this gang
With this mic that I chose
Signed Young Trizz
On a homicide note

[Chorus]You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging

Rich and bitch, LV’s on my kicks
And you know I switch whips like my draws and my fits
Cleaner than a pimp with a purple kush stitch, right?
You know I’m trying to ball like I’m fresh off the bench
Bentley on my wrist, phantom on my neck
See I’m fresh about the bricks but still got them on deck
Life is a movie and you acting on my set
When I yell cut you’ll never work in this town again
I’ll be moving so mean hood nigger with a dream
Gotta stay strapped so I don’t get Martin Luther King
Product of the crime rate, broke niggers why I hate
Take me out the hood but can’t change a nigger mind of state

You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging

… to boutiques I can’t pronounce
Talking not real amounts the cash is … to count
Now that’s cash, fuck bank accounts
The shoe box old just in case I gotta bounce
On the law, cause we ball, night in and night out
The shooters all around, they pull up is like…
Rounds pierce, and I ain’t talking about …
These shots will leave a … nigger … than …
Now back to the Kobe on the rumble bee
Catching rolling through the street is like a tumble …
So my advice to you haters is to come and squeeze
Cause death the only thing that’s gonna humble me

You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
Yeah, yeah
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging

You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
But I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thugging
You could take me out the hood and put money in my pocket
I'mma keep it hood, I ain’t got no other option
Baby I’m rich, and I’m thugging
I’m rich, and I’m thuggingRihanna, Rihanna, Rihanna...

[Verse 1]
91 east to Cerrito
When I got text, detour!
Damn, what baby hittin' me for?
Blowin up my phone make it C4

What's crackin', what's the word, what's the word baby?
Said she kicked that nigga to the curb
And she love the way that I rap
She want that pussy recorded on the set

G, R, and J, nigga wears rough like
So she want a gangsta, well hash-tag thuglife
Get into that pussy, do it like it's dissin'
Got a couple extra hints and I can get you what you missin'

Say you want a slap, leave a couple handprints
Knocked out unconscious on the canvass, first seen her
Yea I'm talkin' Ri-Rihanna, tellin' me to beat it up

I'mma treat it like Rihanna!

[Hook]
Treat it like Rihanna!
Beat it up, beat it up
Cause playin' with the pussy ain't enough
I'mma treat it like Rihanna!
Bitch, call me Chris Brown
She love how a nigga put it down
When I treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna

[Verse 2]
I love a freaky island bitch, now I beat
I beat til she out of it (Hey!)
I love a freaky island bitch, now I beat
I beat til she out of it (Hey!)
I love a freaky island bitch, now I beat
Beat beat til she out of it (Hey!)

I love a freaky island bitch, real nigga
You fuck boys counterfeit
And I count count money like a bank
??? 760 gettin' head from a skank
I can tell you what it is and I can tell you what it ain't
Catch you to that telly, girl it's on til you faint
Put you on a frame, have you open like a Walmart
Kno-knock it out the ballpark
Let me start, got you wetted in the sauna
Beggin' me to beat it up

I'mma treat it like Rihanna!

[Hook]
Treat it like Rihanna!
Beat it up, beat it up
Cuz playin' with the pussy ain't enough

Bitch, call me Chris Brown
She love how a nigga put it down

When I treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna
Treat it like Rihanna[Intro - Crooked I]
Yeah, Million Dollar
I was told only do what you afraid to
Ya scared niggas?
Its power in numbers
From Long Beach to South Central
From Watts to the bank
My nigga Jay Rock

[Jay Rock]
I'm sargent slaughter when I hop up on this track dawg
You know its armada, paint your whole muhfuckin’ town red when my lead hit the tablet
And for the jealous (?) workin’ my (?) like (?)
I’m totally fitted, you collateral damage
Anybody who challenge when I’m on can blow up a planet
Nuclear warfare when I’m on this beat bitch
I’m so hot, eight thousand degree shit
Murk yo ass with my trademark
Step in yo central turn your studio to a grave yard
I go hard you go soft you Barbie, see the pink in your eyes
Nothing but a bitch in disguise
These dick riders, steady tryna hitch ’em a ride
(?) is over, go gitchu a (?)
When this beef cocked back might hit you wit five
Leave yo brains on display for the news at nine
That’s how these Cali boys ride!

[Coniyac]
I does it from (?) new whips
Im on money in a new sense, Im a nuisance
Ain't no barricade I kinda left it, where that new set(?)
I drift my own (?) and bitch I don’t recruit raps
Chase money to catch it we Franklin with (?)
Practice on targets at random and ransom receivers
Word binding is biblical, and (?)
Landmine flow, the Johnny Depp blow as a poet(?)
Im goin town on these niggas that been (?) Adam
Impossible to touchdown on our when we sac em
We sniper decipher (?) summer ignited, we fire
Black dots winter mitten(?) now your times up
Im west now rancid with extravagant transit
Watching (?) get blue bruises to amuse news
Channelling wolverine (?) x-men im damaging
Playin pathologist to bodies just for the sampling
Nigga!

[Glasses Malone]
I ain't no gangbang rookie
School of Hard Knocks, I ain't ever play hookie
Took (?)
Trap hall of fame’ers where the game need to put me
So pushy bully bullies in the streets
(?) quick to bring a fully to the beat
Call that bitch a spoon, they’ll be scoopin yall up
If I ever get to empty all this (?)
Look yung im a different breed of nigga
Hungry, like Birdman don’t feed a nigga
I got work so I don’t need the nigga
Plus I got arms long as Trevor Ariza's nigga
Act silly, test my Kevin hart
We’ll see who get the last laugh you motherfucking Mark
Curry, they screamin hurry up and buy
They see the old dawg in my motherfuckin eyes
Wassup 3x

[Mistah FAB]
I got a gift with this lyrical style
And when I spit you might’ve thought I was a miracle child
Murderous verbous(?) spits deliver passes
Just like irvin did swervin in a suburban in dat car
Full of urban kids
Namin dat title alone terrify my rivals
I never change like islam entertain the bible
The spiritual mythical typical rippin flow
That paralyze mcs im leavin em crippled tho
Con artist I talk a koofi off of muslim domes
Sylvester stallone tell rocky that the king is home
When white bitches bad as sharon stone
Carryin zones bay area's own carry the throne
Love my block so much man I married my zone
I got jazz like jerry and sloan gravedigga
Get out my way fore I bury you homes
Im so unique theres no comparin the clones
I'm gone

[Crooked I]
(?)[VERSE 1: [Kali]]
Im movin' down the freeway
Steppin on the gas
Switchin' my gears
Try not to crash
The bright city lights got me movin' so fast
One twenty on the dash
Chasin' that cash

You can say I'm speedin'
Tearing up the season
Flied by the cops
Like I ain't even see them
Driving through LA
Right through downtown
Flying through traffic
I gotta slow down

I gotta take it easy
But I don't know how
22 inch rims
Sittin low to the ground
When I trip they scrapin'
Check my location
I'm getting road rage
I ain't got no patience

Im runnin' red lights
Talking on the phone
Ridin' shotgun
With Glasses Malone
With west coast song
Plus statik on the beat
Midnight club
Im a savage on the streets

[Chorus: Termanology]
Im movin' down the freeway
In the fast lane
Anybody see me
Getting cash man
Drinkin' my cup
Well in my hair
Movin my (ssshhh)
Doin my thang

Rollin down the freeway
Catch me if you can
Rollin down the freeway
Well in my hand
Rollin' down the freeway
About a hundred grand
Wrapped in rubber bands
Ma man

[VERSE 2: Glasses Malone]
If you talk bout whips
Talk bout G
Your call hop around
Always talkin bout me
Objects the convo
They're so gonzo
Street Race king
Young head honcho

Left dudes warning
Heat like alonzo
Lost a big bet
The price of a condo
Im so sick

Nike on the cad
Cars too quick
My wife even fast
Thats life in the L
Life on the coast
We live in the car
Head wrapped around turn

Haters get bold
They try anything
Heats get exposed
If you let the semi-flame
Go back to the wheel
Then I flip like gymnastics

Had anything
From Benz to a classic
Hold me on the game
Name it then I add it
Then passed to my team
Feelin' like magic

Dodge on deck
Courtesy of Birdman
Phantom up next
Courtesy of Mac-10
West coast baller
Call us the pac ten
Try that bull
We shoot like paxi

Then at the wink of a eye
Man im gone
Too much motive
You can't catch Malone
I mean like come on man
You think I rap cool behind
The wheel dog I'm ill
Just the god damn fool

[Chorus x2][Intro: Problem]
It's hard for a nigga to say what’s up
Straight up

[Verse 1: Problem]
What? I am CA
Diego, LA, to the Bay
Yea, it’s my shit my nigga
L Gang got this my nigga
On lock, on wrap, whatever
I’m rich, come to smell my leather
Rich now but I’m wearing whatever
Cheese burger, no beef come with cheddar
But I ain’t trippin, take it all in
Lick ya girl clit then she take it all in
Best kush fillin my joints
Say I sound too LA, that’s the point
Nigga, what?

[Hook: Problem]
Nigga you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
Nigga you know where I’m from
You know what I represent
-
Got a problem? Say that then
Say that then, Say that then (huh?)
Want a problem? Say that then
Say that then, Say say that then (what?)

[Verse 2: Problem]
Aye, where the bitches at?
Please keep me away from where the snitches at
Cuz I ain’t tryna hear what you gon tell me
At least stay with one ho like I barely
Cash on the celly cuz a nigga getting it
Rhyme and I’m pitchin' it
Ain't shit different
Nigga you sweet, you gon need some insulin
Get him coz I throw my rod deep like a fisherman
Lick her in the kitchen then
Fuck her on the floor tho
Pop the nigga molly, rollin like a 4 door
I ain’t goin down, yea like yo ho go
Getting this money nigga, ball like a cholo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Glasses Malone]
I am CA
Sac town, Sea side, LA
And nigga this my shit
Bad ass DM clique
Crew, gang, mobbing
Say the wrong thing I'm poppin
Ain’t noboby lining nothing up
Interference, we all fuck em up
Drink east side, no cuts, fuck a bandaid
Eating on some crumbs with the mayonnaise
I’m the man and all the hoes see that
Tell me pull up if a bitch nigga need that
On the set

[Hook][Produced by Dnyc3 and Trend]

[Hook: Skeme]
Baby I be out'chea thuggin'

Bitch show a nigga somethin', huh
Bitch show a nigga somethin', uhh
Baby I be out'chea thuggin'
Man fuck all the talkin', bitch show a nigga somethin', huh

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Fucked up, towed back
Only thing on my mind, where the hoes at
Hater mad, and he say "He want his ho back
He tryna' keep this shit, I gave that nigga a ho jack
Shut up bitch, go ahead and poke it
You ain't had dick, so the wood nigga stroke it
That ass shake like it's in and out of focus
Turn that dime bitch to a fiend off of dope dock

[Verse 2: Problem]
Comptown CA, running like a relay
Money make yo' bitch bring it back, like a replay
Hit yo' ho raw, yeah I be like that
I'm about to make yo' ho cum, yeah she be right back, in a minute
Give her a Molly, if she timid
Play one of my songs, watch the bitch get it
Popping that thing like a pill
He won't lick your ass, I will
(Haha, look at they face when I say man, ah fuck it! what!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Towed back, fucked up
Smoking green, codeine in a double cup
Throw them moles on the stove, let 'em bubble up
Pull a fo, drink 'em both like nigga what
I seen a bitch, so thick, oh shit
Drugged up, so I hit 'er with the dope dick
Super blunted, stay one hunnid, like 4 bricks
Ridin' on them handle bars, when I wrote this, what

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
(I'm just a eastside nigga!!) And she know I'm with the shit
Project baby, yeah, she know I got stick
Woah, meet her every time with the stroke
Got 36 ounces, baby know I got blow, yeah

Have her homegirls doin' search party for the swipe
Yeah, girl I got it like that
Got a boomerang thing, so I know she coming right back
Rock!

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Glasses Malone]
I'm all, the way, wit it
Dinner full of digits, talk it how I live it
Nigga gotta' get it, free my nigga 50
New snapback, got it so low, the fitted
I done stole all the whores, yeah nigga, even yours
Had to eat the pussy, since you wouldn't eat it for 'er
Tell 'er, run it, run it, run it, yeah nigga call me Forbes
Get you smacked for that fresh pair of jordans

[Verse 6: Bad Lucc]
Ay, I tell 'er paint my face
She said "The homies tellin'", bitch that ain't my case
She heard I never eat it, bitch I ain't that fake
She took a look at the snake, bitch I ain't that jake
Cuz I'mma, sick nigga, swig hitter
Honey flipper, I'm Bad Lucc, the bitch kisser

She seen her nigga do his thing, but I want this nigga, yeah

[Rick Ross:]
Life in the fast lane, been scared of airplanes
Comfortable on jets, hoes better learn my last name
Yey in the carry-on, that I'm 'bout to carry on
After all the deals, I still deal and carry on

Versus the past, we all shed tears
That's why I pop pills, the end so near
The crackas don't work, niggas just snitch
Lose trial, that's a bitch, nigga go sit

Three hots in the car, where the surf 'n' turf
Three blocks in the car, I'm gettin' what it's worth
From the boss to the bottom, top off the Phantom
Buyin' up the bar so the ladies gettin' at him

You see my eyelids fallin', but sleep prolong
Daddy can't sleep 'til this work all gone
Drub broke down, 10028 zone
I'm seeing new trucks over 28's chrome

Brand new Benz is 600 ponies
Candy on the bitch, candy on the coat
Dreams so sweet now, it's my reality
Nigga don't bite cause you might get a cavity

Now hold me down, clown, call that gravity
Stash so dumb, mine's ridin' shot gun
Doin' 90 down Crenshaw, gotta be careful
Or end up murdered like Cain causin' hell

Rockin' that jewels cause we paid homie
Laid on it, played on it
