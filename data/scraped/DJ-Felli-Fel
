[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
I dont know about you I'm doin what I do
And the way I'm livin' is great
Only thing that I can do, every day continue
Give them haters reason to hate

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
So I'mma live it up (give them haters a reason)
I'mma turn it up (give them haters a reason)
I'mma spend it all (give them haters a reason)
Cause you know I love (give them haters a reason)
Give them a reason to hate

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raw straight from a dice game
Came up roll a Rolls Royce seats light tan
Now we pop champagne for all the suffering and pain
Used to stay in when it rain now I go out and make it rain
No shame, I can pay a years rent with one chain
Still with the same niggas courtside Lakers game
I just took advantage, you just took for granted
Mansion by Nicki crib errthang rented
Damn new case stand in the last king livin'
Bread over bed Stunna said We the business
No reala for , show me love when you see a nigga
Sippin' slow mo in the motion picture, get a ..

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
God damn, I'm the man
And I ain't tryna piss nobody off but I'm just sayin'
My new car, custom painted
In the club everybody show me love like I'm Raymond
Paparazzi taking pictures cause we famous
Money long what I'm smokin' on is dangerous
Ooh, you can use some new arrangements
In the back Im tryna move you up to A-list
And they know Im reppin' Taylor to the grave
Catch me working on some slave shit
For the chains whips
Your favorite rapper on your playlist
Got rich when they were drunk then they find we ain't gon' smoke

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Give em a reason to hate

Dont stop, we going to the top
Always keep them haters fed up
(Give em a reason to hate)

Uh, Felli Fel, Ne-Yo, Yeezy, Calm Down, Easy, Easy

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Keep tellin' me you got a man
But he can't do what I can
Let me, show You what you been missin'
Keep showin' you the minor thing
Let me, show you the finer thing
Let me, show you what you been missin'

[Kanye West]
Right about this time raise your glasses
What's my motivation, that ass is
Start a conversation, like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz
So I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin' again that's music to my ears
What's you think my fuel was for all Of these years?
I'm inspired when people don't like me
It keep me writing so exciting
Man, the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash, that's cake and icing
I asked her 'you buying?'
She said 'no just sight seeing''
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? yeah!

[Hook]

[JD]
Let me show you what is like to be the wife
Of a nigga with a life
That make your head spin around
See it's funny coz I know what you like
But I be see'in you with niggas that ain't right, round hard top
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down
Know'in really that it's time to stop a run around
We don't live twice, only life once
And I know you like nice
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, I'm the boss JD
With him its a limit
With me its a spree
He buy cars
I write you poetry
He send flowers
I send Mercedez
Like ye, say, heaven is everything that heaven it is
And yes, I guess, I'm into trickin' of bizz
But shit, If you had it like I got it
Then you got it as a kid
You say the same thing to a girl
That I just said

[Hook]

[Ne-Yo]
The life I live, fit for a King
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine
We sit back, watch the haters go by

[Fabolous]
I'm not tryna' keep it lost too a minimum
If you associating been in em' or winnin' em'
Then I say I was nine out of ten of them
Frankly I no been and them I like spendin' them
You like the smooth I can white lend'in them
You wan't a thug, hey I look good in a timb
You might win some, but everybody lost one
I put a check on that like Airforce One's
It's easier to lose her than to find her
So wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer
Things, lines, from the top designers
Bling, shine, like you tryin'a blind her
These are just reminders
Just too sign 'Her'
Show her you find 'Her'
Eight, one of a kind 'Her'
Seen a lot of ass, but that one behind her
Let's just say that I'm diggin' that like a miner, ya digg?

Lick shots in the air, bustin that random

My livelihood is not Hollywood

A circus, +Big Top+ like Ringling Brothers
If you wanna learn somethin, (what?) bring your mother! (hey!)
Sit back and observe, invite your friends

Felli on the celly with a couple of twins
Cause tonight, damn RIGHT! We gon' do it again

We goin' party till the early morn
When the Lakers bring the trophy home
We got that California purple gold
And F them Laker Haters cuz we down with the greatest

ICE CUBE:
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep 'em chuckin' and coughin'
Off that California purple, that Laker Purple in the air
C’mon everybody, Paul Pierce need his wheelchair
3rd year, still there, this will be my third
My style's like Magic Johnson, yours is like, Larry Bird
Overrated nerd, but this ain’t the 80′s man
We got Ron Artest, don’t you know, he’s a crazy man
Defense all crazy man! This ain’t no lazy man!
All up in your jersey like the ghost of James Worthy
You ain’t worthy to hold up that championship trophy
Rollin' down Figueroa on the bus with Kobe
Don’t ask my ring size, you already know it
I got a drawer full I might as well throw it
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin' be sweet to watch the Lakers repeat
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat

Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep em' chunkin' and coughin'
Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Chino XL and Roscoe Umali]
Chino XL:
The Lakers are magnificent
Critics better admit it
We winning, shoot it, pivot
With less than a second left and it swishes
Don’t test us, you know how vicious
Artest is, leavin' the Celtics cryin'
Like Lebron when the Magic gave em that ass whippin'
Lake Show you know we down for the kill
Score numbers greater than gallons lost in that BP oil spill
Paul’s pie gets pierced by the king of the kings
Rondo’s obsessed like Schmegal with the Lord of the Rings
His name was Kobe

Roscoe Umali:
Roscoe Umali, I reppin' for the Lakers
The all time greatest, can't nobody fade us
I do it for the jersey that be hangin' from the Staples
Jabbar, West, Magic, Worthy, Chamberlain and Baylor
Fisher, Pau and Bynum got championship rings with diamonds
While the homies Ron Artest to run the defensive assignments
Bench mobbin' Odom, the Black Mamba Kobe
We parade on Figueroa with the championship trophy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 New Boyz and Ray J]
New Boyz:
We the best it's so. How you ain’t a fan by now bro?
Laker’s over there head like it Shannon Brown dunk
Anybody stepping up, we getting rid of them lanes
Say LeBron needs Verizon, he ain’t getting a ring
Play LA and it’s over for sure
Tell them Boston leprechauns that them clovers don’t work
The Lakers win another championship
That’s why we got D Fisher to keep on reelin' 'em in

Ray J
It’s gonna be down Lakers in the motherf---in house right now
Ya’ll need to stop, stop runnin' your mouth
We gone celebrate and pop bottles right now

New Boyz:
Ok I’m ballin, yeah I’m ballin
Them fouls you can’t be callin’
Watch you in it girl
League my n---- we be on that Spartan

Buzzer shot game winnin'

We call that dude the man
Catch us up in LA reppin with my Laker fans
Purple and gold, yeah we smashed 'em up and they gone
Lakers took the whole series and the rest went home

ICE CUBE:

It’s goin be sweet to watch the Lakers
Repeat I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat
Cleveland or Boston

Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin

Come to the plate, get the city what it need
Tryin’ to make a scene and chop for vein
One big swing to bring LA to ring
Bleed Dodger Blue, Tommy Lasorda
I think I saw an old man walking on water
Hey y’all I’m on ? with Clayton Kershaw
He got the Cy Young, who wanna playball
And God tragic, I caught up Magic
And everybody know that Magic flip the cabbage
Pop Bubbly with Vin Scully so lovely, to when in 2013

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]
Let me tell y'all, the definition of shady
It's a nigga like you that think it's all gravy
Do some dumb shit, dumber than join the Navy
What yo' broke ass doin' with a hundred babies?
Strap it on please, you're spreadin' STD's
Throughout the hood, you's a walkin' disease
You took the bad ones, and you turned 'em into sad ones
Bitch you dumb too, fuckin' with the last ones
You's a crazy nigga goin' in and out of there
Like you love it, but nigga I'm outta here
When they crack the door, boy I ain't comin' back
I'm tryin' to figure out, why you keep runnin' back?

[Ice Cube]
Sick with it, bipolar, crazy as the Ayatollah
Went in to buy a soda, now we shootin' at the rollers
He looked at me like "Cube, I thought you was a soldier"
I am nigga, but not for a Coca-Cola
Jumped out my car when his head hit the tar
It bust like a jar but he still wanted to spar
They jumped out, and hit his ass with the taser
Fifty thousand volts turned him into Joe Frazier
Beat they ass, took they badge, took they guns and they cash
Came by the bar, nigga rollin' in they squad car
Blue and red lights flashin' like a superstar
I just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are

[Hook]
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?

[Ice Cube]
You've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up
Sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a donut
My daddy told me that the early bird get the worm
He told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm
Three AM, see you ridin' on that bicycle
Old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?
You's a cold motherfucker like a icicle
With your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel
I should kick ya ass just because she can't do it
Cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid
You say "Yeah man, you better get used to it"
They say God is perfect, and I say he blew it

Y'all know what time it is! But you better stack that money!
(Awww shit! Ha ha ha ha...)
For baaaiiilll....

[Chorus 2X: T-Pain]
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggas sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggas have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, "NOT GUILTY!!!"

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
They used to have me on that paperwork
Cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber Glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggas is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggas down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast

[Chorus - 2X]

Go on and bring it, bring it back like you never did it before
Keep your hands in the air while you drop it down low
Let me see you work it out like a stripper on a pole

[Intro: DJ Felli Fel]
Okay..
If you came to party tonight I need y'all to get y'all drinks in the air
Get your Cîroc bottles in the air
And if you see a sexy lady right now;
Put your-put your hands up!

[Hook 2: Akon]
Your body lookin' amazing when you're dancing like that
Girl, get up on the stage and go ahead and do your thang
Sexy beautiful lady, won't you bring it right back?
Go head and pull a 180, you're my boomerang

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Mommy got a boom bang, bing bang, ding dang
No digga dee, no doubt, I’mma hit that
That thing so fat, looks like she got a
Oompa loompa in her pants, now give me that
I don’t beat around the bush like King K
But I discipline ya, call me sensei
I don’t care what them say
Cause that little chick on Mr. Worldwide – Pen pay
From M.I.A. to L.A. to P.A., leavin' bread like CJ
CJ meeting Pam in the scene on Baywatch
I stay high, what she talk about?
I don't pimp in the parking lot
I got your girl in the bathroom acking a monkey
While I play with her bam boom
Then I throw her back like a boomerang, you buffoon

Felli! I see ya
You know I had to get on this!
Let's go!

That uh-, Rose I pour it, shawty

It's a sight to see her shake her ass (Drop it low)
Fresh to death, I'm polo and we are
In the middle of the floor


Don't dance no more

In ATL
AGM, you know it-know it


And all these shawties

I'm like, "Nigga, you trippin'"
You better act like you know
You better grab you somethin', take your ass to the floor

A-HA!!(Intro)
Hey What up Felli. Knock out. Yo Like I say, Ray J, L.A stand up. Yeah west coast

RAY J -Chorus:
We goin' party till the early morn
When the Lakers bring the trophy home
We got that California purple gold
And F them Laker Haters cuz we down with the greatest

ICE CUBE:
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep 'em chuckin' and coughin'
Off that California purple, that Laker Purple in the air
C’mon everybody, Paul Pierce need his wheelchair
3rd year, still there, this will be my third
My style's like Magic Johnson, yours is like, Larry Bird
Overrated nerd, but this ain’t the 80′s man
We got Ron Artest, don’t you know, he’s a crazy man
Defense all crazy man! This ain’t no lazy man!
All up in your jersey like the ghost of James Worthy
You ain’t worthy to hold up that championship trophy
Rollin' down Figueroa on the bus with Kobe
Don’t ask my ring size, you already know it
I got a drawer full I might as well throw it
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin' be sweet to watch the Lakers repeat
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat

Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off em in the finals so often
Always on fire, keep em' chunkin' and coughin'
Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple

[Hook]

[Verse 2 Chino XL and Roscoe Umali]
Chino XL:
The Lakers are magnificent
Critics better admit it
We winning, shoot it, pivot
With less than a second left and it swishes
Don’t test us, you know how vicious
Artest is, leavin' the Celtics cryin'
Like Lebron when the Magic gave em that ass whippin'
Lake Show you know we down for the kill
Score numbers greater than gallons lost in that BP oil spill
Paul’s pie gets pierced by the king of the kings
Rondo’s obsessed like Schmegal with the Lord of the Rings
His name was Kobe

Roscoe Umali:
Roscoe Umali, I reppin' for the Lakers
The all time greatest, can't nobody fade us
I do it for the jersey that be hangin' from the Staples
Jabbar, West, Magic, Worthy, Chamberlain and Baylor
Fisher, Pau and Bynum got championship rings with diamonds
While the homies Ron Artest to run the defensive assignments
Bench mobbin' Odom, the Black Mamba Kobe
We parade on Figueroa with the championship trophy

[Hook]

[Verse 3 New Boyz and Ray J]
New Boyz:
We the best it's so. How you ain’t a fan by now bro?
Laker’s over there head like it Shannon Brown dunk
Anybody stepping up, we getting rid of them lanes
Say LeBron needs Verizon, he ain’t getting a ring
Play LA and it’s over for sure
Tell them Boston leprechauns that them clovers don’t work
The Lakers win another championship
That’s why we got D Fisher to keep on reelin' 'em in

Ray J
It’s gonna be down Lakers in the motherf---in house right now
Ya’ll need to stop, stop runnin' your mouth
We gone celebrate and pop bottles right now
You ain't gon' top us down

New Boyz:
Ok I’m ballin, yeah I’m ballin
Them fouls you can’t be callin’
Watch you in it girl
League my n---- we be on that Spartan
Number one and you can call in
We put that ass to bed
Buzzer shot game winnin'
Derek Fisher, Ron Artest, Kobe Bryant on they head
We call that dude the man
Catch us up in LA reppin with my Laker fans
Purple and gold, yeah we smashed 'em up and they gone
Lakers took the whole series and the rest went home

ICE CUBE:
I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
It’s goin be sweet to watch the Lakers
Repeat I’m down on the floor, I’m in my suite
Yell "beat LA!" and get Boston beat
Cleveland or Boston
Cleveland or Boston
Glad we playin' Boston, put they ass in a coffin
Watch Kobe Bryant off 'em in the finals so often
Always on fire. Keep 'em chunkin' and coughin'

Off that California purple
(Off that, off that, off that, off that) California purple X4

[Lil Rob]
Check check it
Lil' Rob from San Diego but I’m down for Los Angeles
I'm down with Los Angeles, L.A. K-E-R-S
The best from the west side (Left side)
We at the Pacific to be specific
All I need the purple and gold holmes
If you don’t know, now you know holmes
Don’t act stupid, stupid
You know how we do it, when we hoop it

[Hook/Outro]Okay. This joint is knockin' right here
I don't even need to write to this joint this easy
I'mma just talk to 'em off the top, listen

My interpretation of what the game facin'
I'm basin' my facts on ancient civilization
And my proclamation plus the world and its foundation
My education is statin' black unification
Debatin' whether Satin is situatin'
And placin' me in a state of mind that can't be shaken
It's like a leech slurrin' my specch, energy taken
It's brakin' my fiberglass thoughts that pass through my mental
Lettin' off frustration through meditation in conventional
Dimension in teleportation
And like the length between words in the first grade my mind is spacin'
Out on route like telephone communications through nations
Give me 360 degree rotations my occupation
Spittin' flows and creatin' a creation through experimental situations
They drug me 'cuz my thoughts bloody like menstruations
Makin' my temperature heat up like incubation
They tracin' and chasin' from location to location
I'm stationed at a hotel accomidation
Waitin' to start me and my squad organization
But I'm hesitatin', too many outside irritations
Makin' me pause and might cause altercations
But I'm penetratin', surpassin' so-called limitations
Dedication, motivation and concentration
Manifestation is the key to escalation
And fluctuation of cheese might cause MC's suffocation
Or tax on cats 'cuz no jacks is bein' fakin'
They typically pissin' me off like urination
Deflation and toleration is in consideration
But me in my rankin' is like Bob Marley to Jamaicans
I might be...slightly exaggeratin' but eliminatin'
These snakes wit affiliation got the system scared
Like mice durin' extermination
Erasin' the rhymes rapper's lines wit time and patience
Takin' no shorts, thoughts like woo blunts I'm lacin'
Comin' down like condensation givin' proper information
My interpretation of the rap business
Since my christenin' I wanted to be a rap technician
Splittin' mics in half for my fans when I'm spittin'
Never forgettin' how rap started from the beginnin'
But most of these ignorant rappers talkin' 'bout money they gettin'
Bars they spittin', cars they whippin', nice clothes they dipped in
Hoes they hittin', 9's they grippin'
But they gotta expand they mind and rhyme somethin' different
For instance, that's what I be kickin' in my writtens
But if you listen pay attention positivity's mentioned
My composition has a 50 slash 50 division
I can please both crowds no vocals is my intentions
When I do that wit rap I expand my comprehension
Extendin' my knowledge like goin' to college at Princeton
The industry's missin' and interpretation that's sickenin'
They was wishin' I presented so now I'm forever in it
The business...[Daz Dillinger + (T-Pain)]
Yeah, help for the helpless!
Big money, big cars.. big weed! [T-Pain adlibs]
Y'all know what time it is! But you better stack that money!
(Awww shit! Ha ha ha ha...)
For baaaiiilll....

[Chorus 2X: T-Pain]
I'm on bail, got that weight for sale
Strawberries and blueberries all on a nigga's tail
I'm on bail, bet not 'nare nigga tell... bet not 'nare nigga tell
Yeah!

[Daz Dillinger]
I'm on a two million dollar bail
Caught with the product that them young niggas sell
I'm fresh outta cells, twelve hours later.. my clientele hit my pager
The situation gettin thick, Dat Nigga Daz is major!
I live the life of a gangster, I rob gangsters
Ten years up on the table, I deny that flavor
She a fighter to the fullest, if I lose I catch a bullet (bullet)
Can't tell a nigga nuttin when he starvin and losin
Now I'm back up on the street, completely correctly
You disrespect me, it's the same that's it's gon' be
Automatics get tragic when you let niggas have it
Then I'm caught back up like before, I gotta stack my cabbage
Monday morning, 8:30 right back in court
Couple of homeboys, my momma give me full support
Raised up filthy but the Lord be with me
Like an addict, it's the verdict and the jury, "NOT GUILTY!!!"

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
They used to have me on that paperwork
Cause I used make my paper.. work, lifestyle covered with dirt
See I was first on my block with .40 caliber Glocks
Similarities to my uncut, they ready to rock (ready to rock)
Cause everybody wanna ball, nobody wanna get caught
Only the pros and the cons get to stack these knots
Motherfuckers want that Benz with the millions by the karats
When they fencing all day, they start talkin like a parrot
Information they sharing so be cautious where ya walk
Never pillow talk behind closed doors in the dark
It might creep back and bite you, indict you, convict you
To a five by nine for a very long time
Fuck droppin dimes, niggas is droppin whole hundreds
So the hood's gettin skinny and the one-times love it
If I don't go get it, then the next nigga will
So I kill at will with my gauge in them killin fields
Yeah!

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Yo X, tell my momma to put the house up, wait, the house cost too much
Tell her to get a hundred grand out the Porsche truck
It's just like a house cause I take a bath in it
Get ass in it and I gotta stash in it
Smoke hash in it, blueberry chocolate tah
Smokin chronic make me see shit, like 2Pac alive
Bandana knotted in the front like 2Pac alive
Walkin out the courthouse spittin on the camera guy
I bang (Thug Life), but this ain't Death Row
This some gangster shit for my niggas down on death row
Exhibit A - watch how I let the tec go
And Exhibit B - burn the rubber on the West coast

[Chorus - 2X]

[Xzibit (laughing)] Y'all know y'all miss that shit[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
I dont know about you I'm doin what I do
And the way I'm livin' is great
Only thing that I can do, every day continue
Give them haters reason to hate

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
So I'mma live it up (give them haters a reason)
I'mma turn it up (give them haters a reason)
I'mma spend it all (give them haters a reason)
Cause you know I love (give them haters a reason)
Give them a reason to hate

[Verse 1: Tyga]
T-Raw straight from a dice game
Came up roll a Rolls Royce seats light tan
Now we pop champagne for all the suffering and pain
Used to stay in when it rain now I go out and make it rain
No shame, I can pay a years rent with one chain
Still with the same niggas courtside Lakers game
I just took advantage, you just took for granted
Mansion by Nicki crib errthang rented
Damn new case stand in the last king livin'
Bread over bed Stunna said We the business
No reala for , show me love when you see a nigga
Sippin' slow mo in the motion picture, get a ..

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
God damn, I'm the man
And I ain't tryna piss nobody off but I'm just sayin'
My new car, custom painted
In the club everybody show me love like I'm Raymond
Paparazzi taking pictures cause we famous
Money long what I'm smokin' on is dangerous
Ooh, you can use some new arrangements
In the back Im tryna move you up to A-list
And they know Im reppin' Taylor to the grave
Catch me working on some slave shit
For the chains whips
Your favorite rapper on your playlist
Got rich when they were drunk then they find we ain't gon' smoke

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
Give em a reason to hate
Da da da, da da da
Dont stop, we going to the top
Always keep them haters fed up
(Give em a reason to hate)
Dont stop, dont never let up
Take that paper get your bread up
(Give em a reason)
Dont stop, we going to the top
Always keep them haters fed up
(Give em a reason to hate)
Dont stop, dont never let up
Take that paper get your bread up
(Give em a reason)

[Bridge]

[Hook x2][Kanye West]
Uh, Felli Fel, Ne-Yo, Yeezy, Calm Down, Easy, Easy

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Keep tellin' me you got a man
But he can't do what I can
Let me, show You what you been missin'
Keep showin' you the minor thing
Let me, show you the finer thing
Let me, show you what you been missin'

[Kanye West]
Right about this time raise your glasses
What's my motivation, that ass is
Start a conversation, like as if
You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz
So I ain't gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin' again that's music to my ears
What's you think my fuel was for all Of these years?
I'm inspired when people don't like me
It keep me writing so exciting
Man, the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash, that's cake and icing
I asked her 'you buying?'
She said 'no just sight seeing''
Maybe that's just because you ain't found the right thing? yeah!

[Hook]

[JD]
Let me show you what is like to be the wife
Of a nigga with a life
That make your head spin around
See it's funny coz I know what you like
But I be see'in you with niggas that ain't right, round hard top
Know'in that you really, really want's your top down
Know'in really that it's time to stop a run around
We don't live twice, only life once
And I know you like nice
So how you gone front on me?
Baby, I'm the boss JD
With him its a limit
With me its a spree
He buy cars
I write you poetry
He send flowers
I send Mercedez
Like ye, say, heaven is everything that heaven it is
And yes, I guess, I'm into trickin' of bizz
But shit, If you had it like I got it
Then you got it as a kid
You say the same thing to a girl
That I just said

[Hook]

[Ne-Yo]
The life I live, fit for a King
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine
We sit back, watch the haters go by

[Fabolous]
I'm not tryna' keep it lost too a minimum
If you associating been in em' or winnin' em'
Then I say I was nine out of ten of them
Frankly I no been and them I like spendin' them
You like the smooth I can white lend'in them
You wan't a thug, hey I look good in a timb
You might win some, but everybody lost one
I put a check on that like Airforce One's
It's easier to lose her than to find her
So wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer
Things, lines, from the top designers
Bling, shine, like you tryin'a blind her
These are just reminders
Just too sign 'Her'
Show her you find 'Her'
Eight, one of a kind 'Her'
Seen a lot of ass, but that one behind her
Let's just say that I'm diggin' that like a miner, ya digg?

Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]
Let me tell y'all, the definition of shady
It's a nigga like you that think it's all gravy
Do some dumb shit, dumber than join the Navy
What yo' broke ass doin' with a hundred babies?
Strap it on please, you're spreadin' STD's
Throughout the hood, you's a walkin' disease
You took the bad ones, and you turned 'em into sad ones
Bitch you dumb too, fuckin' with the last ones
You's a crazy nigga goin' in and out of there
Like you love it, but nigga I'm outta here
When they crack the door, boy I ain't comin' back
I'm tryin' to figure out, why you keep runnin' back?

[Hook]
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]
Sick with it, bipolar, crazy as the Ayatollah
Went in to buy a soda, now we shootin' at the rollers
He looked at me like "Cube, I thought you was a soldier"
I am nigga, but not for a Coca-Cola
Jumped out my car when his head hit the tar
It bust like a jar but he still wanted to spar
They jumped out, and hit his ass with the taser
Fifty thousand volts turned him into Joe Frazier
Beat they ass, took they badge, took they guns and they cash
Came by the bar, nigga rollin' in they squad car
Blue and red lights flashin' like a superstar
I just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are

[Hook]
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you a grown crack baby born in the '80s?
Are you the motherfucker that broke in my Mercedes?

[Ice Cube]
You've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up
Sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a donut
My daddy told me that the early bird get the worm
He told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm
Three AM, see you ridin' on that bicycle
Old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?
You's a cold motherfucker like a icicle
With your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel
I should kick ya ass just because she can't do it
Cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid
You say "Yeah man, you better get used to it"
They say God is perfect, and I say he blew it

[Hook]

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
I wanna have some fun
And I know I’m not the only one
I wanna party till the morning sun
And I know I’m not the only one (DJ Felli Fel)
You couldn’t be more sexy
Than you are already
Oh, baby give me some
If you wanna be forever young
Let me know I’m not the only one (Go wild)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Citrics used to write that I wouldn’t make it
Now they write about what I make
Actin’ like the game I couldn’t take it
Now the whole world's for the tape
Eyy, everyday is my Birthday
Everyday I get cake
Now mommy let me see you in your birthday suit
And let's-let's-let’s play
This chico here he got it (Yea)
This chico here he bout it (Yea)
No question dog, don’t doubt it
Now, now get loose, get rowdy
Fuck boys we don’t see ‘em
Y’all players meet, I’mma GM
While I’m taking over these companies
Y’all still playin with per diems
Y’all must of forgot
Chico played on the block
Chico played on the court
Chico handled the rock
Chico played with the pot
Chico handled the rock
Bag ‘em up, then hand ‘em out
Off sore I’m drillin’ it
Over seas I’m killing it
I just came to have some fun
So Cee Lo keep singing it

[Hook]
(Uh Huh)

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Let’s get trippy at my private party
White girl twerk like Miley Cyrus
Let’s see how many model chicks
Can fit inside of my Ferrari
You a bad girl
Show me how you naughty
Your looks could kill don’t hurt nobody
I’m rollin’ up that loud pack
My blunt fatter than a hot tamale
We sippin lean, poppin bottles
I take more shots than the paparazzi
These haters don’t want no problems
I got more goons than John Gotti
Made nigga, paid nigga
It’s going down like a grave digga
Take your girl to my hotel
And beat it up like Mayweather
In VIP a couple hundred deep
That’s Juicy J and his partners (Chilli)
They might have to call the fire department
We ordered all these sparklers
Like a scarecrow I want more brain
Get more neck than a gold chain
These college girls got no shame
We party hard Kurt Cobain

[Hook]
(Eeeeeeeewhoo…)

[Bridge: DJ Felli Fel & Pitbull & Cee Lo Green]
Everybody clap your hands, hands hands
Everybody clap your hands, hands hands
(I just came to have some fun)
Everybody clap your hands, hands hands
(I just came to have some fun)
(So Cee Lo keep singing it)
