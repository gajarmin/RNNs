(Intro) Yo, what's up? This Andre. If you get this message, uh, give me a call back. [I'm] tryna catch up with Messy; have Messy call me as soon as possible. That's cool. [I'm] tryna catch up with Messy. If you could give me a call back that'd be dope

Man, I'mma run my mouth and get your corporate account
Bring my benz out in the middle of a drought
I blow lye like it's "God Bless Buddha"
It's sort of like the feelin' runnin' with a known shooter
Baby I'mma spit it to the limit, run into the abyss
You know it's god number 7 on your top ten list
It's kamikaze, look into the eyes of a pisces
And Las Vegas talkin' shit is where you might find me
Fillmo' down from the nose to the toes
Get your cell phone you can picture every pose
Picture all the clothes, picture all the hoes
Picture the perfection when your money pile grows
You gotta crocodile style, I sport gators
They still might bite, so fresh with the flavor
Got Khan? Fillmore's number one sign
Steak, potatoes, garlic bread and some prime!

[Hook: Messy Marv (Andre Nickatina)]
(YEEEAAH) San Francisco baby
Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, YEEEAAH
(Yeah money is the motto
And run around town like its Grand Theft Auto, Chicka-kahnn)
Wally on my hip, good weed in my mouth
Gangsta niggas in the whip, YEEEAAH
(Your not dealin with clowns
When you try to kick hop, watch your body shut down)

[Messy Marv]
Yeah, nigga I'mma mothafuckin' fool
Trees for breakfast, eat brunch by noon
24 Davins, only showin the lip
The rest of the women, same color as the whip
Jump out and crack a nigga shit wide open
Jump back in the nickle with the barrel still smokin
Fillmore nigga, yeah bitch break bread
I don't want no pussy, I don't want no head
But you can get a sack of that purple stuff
Some gin and a bag of that Hillary Duff
I'mma pimp, trapped in a gangsta's body
I'm on dope and gonna fuck around and hurt somebody
On tuesday and thursday the ghost pull up
Then everybody runs, they'll fuck you up
I'mma shady ass nigga, man I ain't gon' lie
I just wanna sell dope, smoke weed and get high, you BITCH

[Hook: Messy Marv (Andre Nickatina)]
(YEEEAAH) San Francisco baby
Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, YEEEAAH

[Andre Nickatina]
You might mistake me for Doug E. Fresh, the way I sport ballies
With my Slick Rick talk and my Slick Rick walk
I wear rings like the planet called Saturn
The money's movin' baby then your body is the pattern
You know I hide out like it's witness protection
Some people start to stare like a model car collection
You know it's like: twenty G's in a Jordan briefcase
My hood came up off the word "freebase"
Man the soul of a grammy runs through my body structure
My bottom ho cries, cause I never say I love her
It's a cold word, thats why I p-p-p-party
My lawyer is a sneaky motherfucker, very naughty
With hot lies, I hit Popeye's for hot fries
A real rap cat, talkin' 'til the sun rise
What's your astrology, and your biography
I talk a little bit to get you to follow me
I'm like the quality, you like the quanity
Fillmore born and ain't no apology

[Messy Marv]
San Francisco baby
Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, YEEEAAH

You fags bitter mad wanna be fakin' class with us
How they thinkin' they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hatin' on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder stuck
Not a nare not a breath a stutter that conjure a
Nothin', nathin', the ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head it was soundin' like it's bassin'
Boom bing bang on you haters in the game
Strange lane takin' aim ain't a damn thang sane
I get it in, want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction, from beneath you we just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringin' the bucks in

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
They wanna leave me with nothin' (Uh-uh)

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
On the block it was hot to not to run from the cops
I used to cop and used to chop and dump my rocks at Ms. Scott's
And on the late night at Ms. White's I'm fuckin with Will
We used to play fight then one night we came up with Vill
Young thugs dump drugs nigga hungry for meals
Young thugs jumped blood nigga itchin' for kills
Shit was real in the field man this shit was too real
Lost my homies to this shit man this shit is for real
But nigga nowdays the streets they go hard on the hustla
All these pussy niggas rattin' so us real niggas suffer
Not plentiful for me no more it's hoes in the game
Since I smell when paper foldin' man I'm rollin' with Strange
Pour some whiskey party with me tell the Feds if they miss me

So all you muthafuckin sucka niggas wishin' me gone

[Repeat Hook:] (2x)(* cover of Slick Rick's "Children's Story")

Yeah
OG Joe Blow in the house, understand me
Layin it down with my boy Messy Marv
Yeah, for ah - Slick Rick
Yeah, this ain't no children's story, though
This somethin for the hood, mang
So ah - all the OG's grab your ripple
And players grab you twomp sacks

Here we go...

Once upon a time not long ago
When niggas made money slingin dank or dope
When chronic was burnin and everything was all good
And people were behavin hella bad in the hood
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy, and this is what he said:
"Me and you tonight, we're gonna make some cash
Pullin 211's and makin the dash"
They did the job, scrilla came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another
(Stick em up, stick em up!)
And a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man, a SFPD undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started actin erratic
He said, "Keep still, boy, no need for static"
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little nigga was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said "Why'd ya hit me?"
Tec-9 aimed for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid starts to figure
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radioes in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw the sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked around good and from expectations
He decided he'd head for the BART station
But (what?) she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin top speed till he was out of breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him (Sorry!)
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?
(Who?) Coon, the dopefiend smokin hella dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"
The dopefiend pulled out a sawed-off shotgun
He broke outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a hyped up Nova
Sideways up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near the KOP
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head, he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, "Back up or the bitch here's dead"
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped the Tec, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a poor man's dream
Big Mike shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so bitch, don't you laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
So learn a little lesson cause the game don't last

Good night

Leave a mess Marv ( *repeated* )

Yeah
That's right
Messy Mizznarv
And it goes down
For my boy Slick Rick the Ruler
And it don't stop
And it don't quit
And it don't stop
I'm on a whole nother level
I'm on a whole nother level
Trigga Lock RecordsChorus 2x *(Messy Marv)*

All my niggas in the ghet-ta
Acceptin no losses, no cheats an no let downs
Foul cats mess around get the wet down
In yo city
Leave yo whole turf shut down
(Sucka What Now?)

Verse 1 *(San Quinn)*

It's lethal
The streets'll take ya where ya don't need to go
Ammunition
Bullet proof
Ghetto blastas slammin roofs
Straight loot an pursuit
To survive be bout politics
We not ruthless for suckas it's bound to make me contradict
Conflict of intrest
Because my Mobb is relentless
Suckas don't wanna see us in this or win this
Splended
Less suckas to worry bout
Broke niggas make the best crooks
Crossas an killas
More scrilla I accumulate
Enough to feed my reals
Not concerned about the murder rate so when I'm a get drilled
I be prayed up
Over raw
Wakin up's enough for me
But when I rhyme my minds on the grind
Strictly hustlin
I'm back to bust
It should be lavishly surroundin
Naturally reboundin from the loss cuz you thought I was grounded
This how we do it
The truth gets screwed gets ???
Me retire, the file wit ridas that remain at

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 2 *(Messy Marv)*

Bow down to the west world
In the bucket flossin wit yo best girl
Wanna turn up in the pearl
Now you muggin when you rollin by
Wanna get wet by the Tech cuz you lookin dry
Seen the hate up in yo eye
Be on the flight the next mornin
Suckas flex in Kanas, Seattle an Oregon
I got game
Doin thangs in 25 states
No condition we straight
Ammunition we hate
Kept it up in the case
Gangsta
In body armor
We rappers say "This is fake" when people's quick to bomb on ya
An bet a dime on ya
Befo' ya make a false move
Then get lost in yo crew
Now they all boo-hoo
Ya stay in doo-doo
Fucked around an got flushed
Out of line
Out of time
Thinkin you can't be touched
We quick to rush
Cuz suckas sit in concrete and calmly
Blow bomb-diggy on my way back to the big city

*(Chorus)* 2x

Verse 3 *(San Quinn)*

Respect
We check the neck
You next
Seff an Mess
Elliot finess
At yo front steps, God bless
Lyrics you fearin no non-sense we far fetched
Leave you outlined stretched
Wit yo mind wrecked
I Rolex, you Timex
Watchin time tick
If it rhyme hit yo target sucka
Accurate
My limits
Have no maximum
Mashin 'em
Runnin down the platinum
Half of 'em rappin
I be surpassin 'em
My squad do the job
Let them do rappin
They rob
We gon' survive
While you dispise
Frisco playas live
Eyes wide scopin
Hopin we ain't touchin
Then we high rollin
High side wit our mouths open
Gold showin
I'm representin the playas an pimps
Playin simps
Pursuin mill tickets, bangin my hits
Still we kill 'em this is like 11-Feev (11/5)
Keep it real like the 6-9 Vill you suckas best believe

*(Chorus)* 4x[Hook]
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (everybody know me)
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (everybody know me)
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (everybody know me)
I make big money, buy big cars, everybody know me (like I'm a movie star)

[Verse 1 - Killer Mike]
Talking money, getting Mike in new pair of Nikes
They said life was a bitch so I made her my wife
I'm talking holy matrimony 'til some other fucking money
Them other boys is talking but I swear to God they phony
Fuckboys crazy, nothing but [???]
That's why my motto to this day is still 'Fuck you, pay me'
Any rap nigga acting like he want it with me
I swear to God I'll put his rapping-ass next to Biggie
I swear to God I'll put his rapping-ass next to Pac
Martin Luther King, nigga, certified by the block
Gold 54 riding all chrome, big block
And the paint so wet I'm in need of a mop
Black and yellow Chevy and it's looking like a bumblebee
My partner came through in his Gellardo trying to humble me
I left, came back, Murciélago straight stunting G
When he seen me bending left, nigga must have shit hisself

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Messy Marv]
Gucci shirt, Gucci jeans, Gucci this, Gucci that
Before I walk out the house, everything gotta match
I ride through this bitch with a pocket full of money
I bet no nigga won't say nothing in front me
I went and bought a Benz and went and got a bike
Went and stopped by the paint shop then sprayed 'em cold white
Them 24-inches man, you know what it is
A nigga put 'em on so my shit'll look big
I'm a certified goon, I be putting in work
I ride with the cannon cause I be doing hella dirt
I'm the all black fitted with them all-black swatches
Pushing through the ghetto running from the paparazzi
All the hood niggas love me
The price on the coke, nigga, it look so lovely
I'm a thug 'til I die
The club ain't poppin' if these bitches ain't high
You know me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
Trina, Lil Kim, Mariah
Rihanna even Mýa
Got reps like singing cheques
A whip for each desire
They told me never to burn a bridge but I still keep a lighter
Ain't met a former friend that proved he can compete with fire
And the paint so wet I gotta park my cars inside a dam
So fly my clothing line should be called the 'Mileage Plan'
Metal inside my hand promise it ain't no trying fam
That Marvel comic baby
(What you mean?)
That Iron Man
That Maserati body parked right there outside the lobby
P-O-P to your body if you ever trying to try me
And the paint soaked c-c-candy ladies wanna lick my like a lolli-
P-O-P so my hobby is to sit behind a Jolly-
Rancher, look at my swagger, my name is more than known
My garage the square footage of the Georgia Dome
Got imported stones, always order chrome
Every other week my ride is gonna be exactly what I want it on

Inside of ya head it was soundin' like it's bassin'
Boom bing bang on you haters in the game
Strange lane takin' aim ain't a damn thang sane

Suction, from beneath you we just a little dust'n
All because I'm bringin' the bucks in

You see them cherry red chucks? Yeah I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out man I hit 'em up

Baby I'mma spit it to the limit, run into the abyss
You know it's god number 7 on your top ten list
It's kamikaze, look into the eyes of a pisces
And Las Vegas talkin' shit is where you might find me
Fillmo' down from the nose to the toes
Get your cell phone you can picture every pose
Picture all the clothes, picture all the hoes
Picture the perfection when your money pile grows
You gotta crocodile style, I sport gators
They still might bite, so fresh with the flavor
Got Khan? Fillmore's number one sign
Steak, potatoes, garlic bread and some prime!

Jump out and crack a nigga shit wide open
Jump back in the nickle with the barrel still smokin
Fillmore nigga, yeah bitch break bread
I don't want no pussy, I don't want no head
But you can get a sack of that purple stuff
Some gin and a bag of that Hillary Duff

On tuesday and thursday the ghost pull up
Then everybody runs, they'll fuck you up
I'mma shady ass nigga, man I ain't gon' lie
I just wanna sell dope, smoke weed and get high, you BITCH

[Hook: Messy Marv (Andre Nickatina)]
(YEEEAAH) San Francisco baby
Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, YEEEAAH
(Yeah money is the motto
And run around town like its Grand Theft Auto, Chicka-kahnn)
Wally on my hip, good weed in my mouth
Gangsta niggas in the whip, YEEEAAH
(Your not dealin with clowns
When you try to kick hop, watch your body shut down)

[Andre Nickatina]
You might mistake me for Doug E. Fresh, the way I sport ballies
With my Slick Rick talk and my Slick Rick walk
I wear rings like the planet called Saturn
The money's movin' baby then your body is the pattern
You know I hide out like it's witness protection
Some people start to stare like a model car collection
You know it's like: twenty G's in a Jordan briefcase
My hood came up off the word "freebase"
Man the soul of a grammy runs through my body structure
My bottom ho cries, cause I never say I love her
It's a cold word, thats why I p-p-p-party
My lawyer is a sneaky motherfucker, very naughty
With hot lies, I hit Popeye's for hot fries
A real rap cat, talkin' 'til the sun rise
What's your astrology, and your biography
I talk a little bit to get you to follow me
I'm like the quality, you like the quanity
Fillmore born and ain't no apology

[Messy Marv]
San Francisco baby
Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, YEEEAAH
Wally on my hip, good weed in my mouth
Gangsta niggas in the whip, YEEEAAH[Intro:]
He's a he's a he he's a gangsta (8x)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Funkmaster like Flex heavy metal remedy (BLAHOO)
Knock ya out'cha socks put'chu out your misery (OWH)
Homicide try'na holla they wanna question me {"we need to talk to you"}
Cause I'm always into beef and smoke broccoli [coughs]
I do my dirt by my lonely I ain't tellin' on me
I keep my mouth shut like James Beasley and Lil D, solid
Find me guilty I do my time even if I'm sixty
Long as I get out with my pride and my fuckin' dignity
Real, born in it surrounded killers, dealers and robbers
Mommas identifying bodies in they pajamas (that's my baby)
Teenagers packing and riding 'round with them llamas (rah rah)
Squeezing on niggas like anacondas (bah)
I'll put tips on a nigga we can fade and we can locked up like this
Or we can get off into some of that old shoot-em-up bang-bang gangsta shit (Blaoo)
Most of the time it's over a bitch when the funk spark
This dog gotta bite that'll back up his bark
BITCH!

[Hook: Kaveo/E-40]
Yeah, broad daylight or midnight he'll air this muthafucka out
(He's a gangsta)
We don't buddy up we dummy up
One squeeze'll bring a nigga to his knees
(He's a gangsta)
You didn't know, we got fireworks we'll come through and grand finale yo block
(He's a gangsta)
If we cross paths or bump heads, it ain't on on sight it's on demand
(He's a gangsta)

[Verse 2: Messy Marv]
Black mobs, beaver minks and black Glocks
Kim Cole hard bottoms nigga with no socks
This gangsta in it dawg nah ain't got candy paint
I beat it my cases with cash my nigga no running
My heart pump no fear to a nobody
You drive by material black Maserati
One nigga, one black mack, four black bodies
Giving niggas scared play homie like Greg Woolley
And I ain't into playing no checkers with'chu lil niggas
Homie I knock down pines and fuck over rooks
I got gangstas from that lil D ear shook
I catch ya digging in ya nose and life can get tooks
Niggas never seen a Canali suit
Show I showed em one and double so let'cha know I'm coppin' mo than one
When I'm yanking on sumthin' I'm poppin' mo than one
If I see ya ass and give ya a pass then ya owe me one

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: The Jacka]
Err place I show up I got the pistol trippin'
All my niggas feel safe when I'm in the building
Make a nigga feel raped when I slap his melon
With the ass of the cannon spot get ready
By a hyenas
Harder than life a level for we dine divas
Tech cool with ya sickness of swine netter
Never heard a tech cause these fakers a prime-retta
Fresh up outta Tina's back in the crime bidness
Keep my lawyer paid cause she is a damn genius
Keep my niggas paid to murder the star witness
Never saw a reign when niggas is start snitching
But part of the game is death so now it's just more killing
Selling up a pack to send in him to a fella
Who slit his fuckin neck fore he think about telling
Eight a thousand years like a Gladys Knight breakfast and I'm in the lobby fear cause

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
He's a he's a he he's a gangsta (8x)-=- Messy Marv -=-

Thug livin' and drug dealin'

]From bein' a broke ho

Me and my niggas mash on those
Ricky ass no class punk ass hoes
You know my stee low
Bitch kicks, shops
Bricks all broke down into twomp chops
And on my block

And believe me, when I see you, Im a call you a bitch
BITCH!

-=- Chorus -=-
(2x)

-=- Messy Marv -=- (Verse 2)
See Im used to this

Still choppin' at the gap and boots at Nine West
You see nappy head niggas, like myself
Get a punk bitch, shake their hand and the scrill
Bitch you under-still
I keep it thugged out like yup boy
Whatcha wanna see me in the Lexus of the trunk boy

Coward ass fashionable, low class bitches
When it gets specific

Lookin' all fucked off bitch and lil as fuck

Ho it ain't no love
BITCH!

-=- Chorus -=-
(4x)[Messy Marv]
I'm ten hundreds on these niggas, little iron fangers
In the back of the club with the gangbangers
Canaries in my watch with them Bathing Apes
Doin my body like this, workin my thizz face
I'm ballin, why would I fuck with a ripper
Tryin to hit Magic City, I'm in love with a stripper
Drinkin that silver, up all night
On them green mack, dressed in them yellow and blue Nikes
Uh-huh, once again it's on
She tryin to take a few flicks for her camera phone
Yeah, pretty lips, cute face

[Messy Marv]
I'm fifty 20's on these niggas, little ICI

Look you don't know what the fuck a nigga been through out here

[Verse 1: Messy Marv]
Look Donnie I'm from a place we will fuck you up
In chase you down, the silva Roam nigga the lone town
Late night around this mutha fucka I ain't blew
No big backyards, no swimming pools
Just coke white t's man and dope money
We introduce the system trying take my life from me
I left my baby mama for another bitch
Young nigga trying creep on a another lick
Them white boys jump out on a nigga quick
Had to throw away a gun in another clip
They want me to go to church, but I'm not a saint
Ya homey a hypocryte, this what a nigga ain't
I squeeze triggers man them bullets fly
Right After that muther fuckers call homocide
If you don't put in work your stomach growl
Then they take you to trial, nigga you don't know what I been through

[Verse 2: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know somebody gunna have to come get me
And if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you
Thugging for plenny days, thugging for plenny nights
With this shit in my trunk, dodgeing them colored lights
They say my life is dark, my future was never bright
Some people say I'm wrong, I tell'em ain't nothing right
I barely sleep when I do it's somewhere locked away
It ain't for long, I'm trafficing these blocks about a block away
Haters trying block this chopper, cocked they ain't gunna block today
Many blocks I got come up short they gunna get rocked away
My brother doing life, I told him I'd be coming for him
If my ass don't make it through this trip tell em it wasent for him
If I end up back on my ass everybody is dinner
You let me eat you get to live everybodys a winner
I'm in the bottom where devil even scared to come
And little homies keep artillery equipped with drums
Chea, all I know is I'm a make it bitch
They say this shit is for the taking, I'm take it bitch

[Bridge/Hook: Trae]
I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know someone gunna have to come get me
And know if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you

(And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you) [x2]

I tell em times hard, the pain is even harder
I used to pray for help but now I don't even bother
They tell me life a bitch.and I ain't got a chance
Now I'm in all black pistol in back my pants
Before it's over, know someone gunna have to come get me
And know if I go some one gunna have to come with me
I struggled all my life this here ain't nothing new
And fuck switching it up nigga who the fuck is you[Bailey]
I'm sky ballin', a young California pimp
Loungin' in a stretch Bently sittin low on the tents
Iced down, draped an dipped hittin bomb weed (bomb weed)
Servin' on stega shrimp, sippin' Dom P (Dom P)
Lavishly cordinated
Savagely corporated
On casino, Mr. Gambino's Mobb affiliated
The world is mine, that's what I read on a blimp
Playin cops I'm a robber with blue prints to the mint
Didn't leave no evidence, went back to, my residence
Snatch the Benjamin's, an all the other dead presidents
My hoochies like to toss me the coochie
Floss me in Gucci
But groupies would never cost me no Loochie
What I look like?
Givin' a ho all my doe, like she wrote all my flows
Bitch I'm all-pro
You be the same ho, on the stroll makin' me mo dinero
So tip-toe through the rain, sleet an snow

[Hook]
I gotta get my Money Over Bitches
They want the money, I want my riches
[x2]

[San Quinn]
Quinnton mania, hoes I'm tamin' ya
Never praisin ya, never payin ya
Nothin' mo than attention
Havin' paper is an addiction
Your not bringin additions
Then subtract yo self from my jurisdictions
This is how I see it
My crew we be the cleanest
Pushin' Benzes and Beamers
These hoes ain't pleased to meet us
Pass us Master Cards an Visas
Illegal searches
We smokin' roaches with no crutches
Bitches we cope, from bein' broke and do it like a hustla a
Ain't no friends we all cousins
Baby networkin'
Money ain't nothin'
You got it all? You need to quit perpin'
A quarter million wouldn't satisfy me
I be a Master like P
And I act like Luni
Only God can do me
Burn a crutch with doobie, approach smoothly
Only ladies with paper amuse me, an broke hoes choose me
But lose bein' in a pursuit of tryin to talk
For the conversation of fuck you and shit bitch it's goin to cost

[Hook] x2

[Messy Marv]
I got 2 for 1, from Ya-yo to in-do
Paper now, hoes later, the tradition in Fil-mo
Dime-els, bricks of Ya-yo, coke dealers, crack sales
Niggas that tell on Big Willies
Young killas, bitches that jock, look at 'em stare
Got 'em choosin, got hoes droolin' on a playa
My gold teeth glare, shinnin' like cheese goin "Bling"
Knock Out Playa, K-O-P in the street
I fuck with big timers, ridin' sideways with young thugs
Don't manipulise, of Fil-mo hood nudge
Shake hood slugs, make hood drugs
Never could, never would a nigga ho trust
Money Over Bitches
Trust a bitch I never would
Ho I'm too major
Havin' paper like Tiger Woods
Famous in the Mo
Rob from the rich and slang Ya-yo to the poor
Flippin', manipulate a dumb ho
For way mo'
I tell 'em BIA-TCH!!
I love ballin', how could I be tired of bein' rich?
Been off the hook so long, got disconnected unexpected
And you niggas is wrong for payin' hoes an ho protectin'

[Hook till end]
