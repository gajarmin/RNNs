[Hook]
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' on four fours wrapped in four vogues
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours

[Slim Thug]
Now look who creeping, look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pullin tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Barre sipping, car dipping, Grant wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four vogues
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on the endo GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me cuz I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent SwishaHouse (Ha!)

[Hook - 2x]

[Mike Jones]
Four fours I'm tippin'
Wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck and your dame missing
Me and Slim we ain't trippin' I'm finger flippin' and syrup sippin'
Like do or die I'm po' pimping car stop rims keep spinning
I'm flipping drop with indvisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens'
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got do-do to burn with a pint of lean
It takes grinding to be a king
It takes grinding to be a king
First Round Draft Picks coming
Who is Mike Jones coming
Slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones (who?) Mike Jones the one and only you can't clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me (I said!)
Back then hoes didn't want me, now I'm hot hoes all on me

[Hook - 2x]

[Paul Wall]
What it do it's Paul Wall I'm the People's Champ
My chain light up like a lamp cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to an ant, cause I'm low to the Earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same SwishaHouse or SwishaBlast
Mike Jones, he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet going nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holding my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby what you know bout me
I'm on that five nine Southlea baby holla at me

[Hook - 2x]

And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside

Chopping holes in all the walls that's all they saw

[The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead it just took a couple shots

She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week

[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
Till them niggas lying still up in stiff cases

[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier

That is where I sleep now give me my key

[N.O.R.E.]
New York get the blood money, dirty cash still sweet

And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick

[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling

I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga

One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood

[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up

[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two
Let's go you're eyeing us in the iron bus, boom

Your life's sweet, MTV's Laguna Beach
Mama told me not to play with fire but
She never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs but I'm in the thangs
Save the colors for the cars see we kill for the fame
The boss made it yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas

Letting off a hundred rounds let the barrel pick
And we gon sit here and wait for the derelicts

[Twista]
Bitch Chi got Lords and Gangsters show me where them niggas at

West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz

[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride

[WC]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood

[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies

[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood

[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green

All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not

[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???

[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus

[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up
I'd advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Got plenty cheese plenty carats, man we looking like some caterers
And its looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that trunk be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Getting money's what I'm bout
I'ma get it while these haters just talk
(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Gotta do it for the north
Gotta do it for my hustlers in the south
(Still breaking boys off, boys off, still breaking boys off)
And when I do it I'ma do it like a boss (still breaking boys off)

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
I still represent H-Town, the city of that candy
They see me with a lotta cars but they don't understand it
They say the never seen ya boy out here gettin his grind on
Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Yeh this the city thats slow, the city thats thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
And sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)
6-10, I-10, 59, 45, and da belt
This Clutch City but we play what we delt
Reppin the H-Town

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Paul Wall]
Hustle town's my home, it's where I do my dirt
Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north
I'm talking Tidwell and Carverdale and Greenspoint too
From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall wat it do baby

[Verse 6: Yung Redd]
(Heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)
Purple so muddy I can barely even drive
Stay blowin down trees like a Category 5
Southside of H-Town the heart of Sunny Side
I could walk these streets if I was blind, nahmtawkinbout?
Yung Reedd, take ya out the future
Stars imitate swear to God I was a jewler
Robert Davis, Fat Pat, this for you
To my homie Big Hawk, I salute
MAYNE!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Lil Keke]
H-O to the U-S, T-O to the N
God blessed me with the million dollar pen
See them quiet money gangstas with they hand in the air
That Sunny Side and South Park, I was raised out there
This is H-Town (H-Town), screwed up and slowed down
It's all love homie, keep rolling up the whole pound
Pull up in the monster just look at him hiding
Don Ke' heart of the south, slab riding

[Verse 8: Z-Ro]
H-O-U-S-T-O-N, T-E-X-A-S
We go get it and come back with it until we take our last breath
From the city where our stadiums drop the top
Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto pass is good in any hood, any block they got
The white cup is for the codeine and the cigarillo is for the kush
If you want it we got it cause there's not a product we dont push
We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we filthy
So homie you must be touching it wrong if you don't feel me (you don't feel me)

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Welcome to H-Town, this 3rd Ward talking

Boys better chill 'fore this throw-away leave they curtains closed (lights out)
I'm in the slab but I'm tippin it like a platinum Rolls
Suicide make the door presidential when they decide to close (real talk)
They want the throne but tell the haters that I got it locked (got it locked)

To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind

It's Slim Thuga and DC outta H-Town

[Video Version--Bun B]
Well it's the King of the Underground, and the King of the Trill

You're tuned into a winner that's never takin' a loss
Reppin' Houston with Beyoncé and Slim Thug The Boss
Diamonds on the wood peel, I'm a Dirty South Soldier
Draped up and dripped out homie, I thought I told ya...

Pullin tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grant wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on that indo GameCube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand me cuz I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big Glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big Boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm ridin' Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the nawf
Ain't shit changed I still represent (Still..), Hanh!

[Slim Thug - Hook - 4x]
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Tippin' four hoes, and I'm packin' four fours (Here Lizard, Lizard, Lizard)

[Chamillionaire]
Ay Bigg Tyme
I'm tryna see the president dead (presidents dead?), that's what I said
But not the one in the white house man, the one with the green presidents head
Blue or red I'm still ridin', ladies be tellin' me that I'm sexist
And I guess it's, cuz I always love the money over dresses
Always been about them horizontal lines through them S's
That's a dollar sign, Impala flyin' watch how she undresses
Don't matter, if she black or white, dark or bright, she ain't actin' right
I'mma take that pretty braud out to eat, and then leave her there with a
Appetite
Niggas tell me they look up to me, and I know what y'all mean
Cuz I'm balling with tall green stacks taller then Yao Ming
All King, Koopa the Don, cruise with a gun
If being rich was a contest, Chamillion you would've won
I know, but watch the jealousy cuz ya still a get trampled
If you got whipped in the past then ya still a example
Treatin' niggas like Swishahouse flows, nigga what?
Soon as he start talkin' slow we gon' chop that boy up

[Slim Thug - Hook - 4x] {Chopped & Screwed}
Still Tippin' on four fours, wrapped in four vogues
Pimpin' four hoes, and I'm packin' four fours[Hook: RiFF RaFF x2]
Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss
How to come through with seven coats of the gloss
Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man
Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss
How to buy the car, how to buy the house
Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
I could show you how to be the boss
I could show them boys how we ride on that North
So clean top off, looking good
Still comin' down tippin' fours through the hood
Whipping on the wood in that cocaine Mulsanne
Could buy another Mulsanne if I sold my chain
Old school Y-frame seven coats of the gloss
Thugga been the boss since I left Swisha House
Break 'em off, Top Texas, drive slabs reckless
Wake up every day to bad bitches and breakfast
Boss Life, better get your money right
Me and RiFF RaFF pouring fours in the Sprite
With your bitch, burning bowls after light
Paul Wall called to say it's going down tonight
H-Town, North Side Thugga
I could show you boys how to hustle

[Hook]

[Verse 2: RiFF RaFF]
Yeah a chain with the charm, Versace car alarm
Roll though your city smelling like a thunderstorm
Teleport to Prom, python on my arm
But don't get me wrong I want the world in my palm
Crawl like ant farm, I'm crawling like a baby
Pop trunk on Antoine, I let it down in Katy
The candy grey Mercedes, I sold it at an auction
Rap Game Sadie Hawkins, got a ticket for jay-walking
If I had a option, I'd pick all of the above
Oriental rugs and I'm flyer than a dove
You could show me love, or you can get lost
Four-story houses, I recline on Prada couch
Shark grill in mouth, better watch your language
Paul Wall and Johnny got me frozen like a penguin
Colder than a polar, Jody Husky sandals
Slide down 45 in the black licorice Lambo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I show you how to get muddy on sunny day
Drop a soma in your soda if you want to play
Pour a four in a twenty like a shot clock
48 for the watch, hundred dollar socks
Getting money is an understatement
I pay the Corvette for the matching bracelet
Half a million worth of jewelry, it's high maintenance
Getting full of more meds than a cancer patient
I could show you how to grind like a brake pad
I got a hundred acre island with a helipad
No key, start the car with an iPad
Drank stains on my shirt is the new fad
Shit don't stink, underwear made of mink
Big Moe, purple soda, ain't never pink
Have you ever mixed a two-liter with the pint?
I could show you how to drank 'till you faint

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Swangin through the south side last night baby
You know that I was coming from my trap
Accompanied by a couple sexy ladies
And a couple paint bottles in my lap
And I have never swung this wild
Like future, I lost my mind and my top at the same time

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Ten, eleven slabs in a single file line (summertime)
Pocket full of money (that's how we do it in the summer time)
All those players got a bad ass woman on their side (summertime)
And the diamonds in the teeth (yeah)

Summertime in my city
Ain't nobody tripping
Summertime in my city
We just smoking and sipping
Summertime in my city
Ain't nothing but love
Summertime in my city
Every hood is like a club

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Thugga
It's summertime in my city man
It's a bunch of fine dames looking pretty man
I'm trying to take a few with me man
Hoping HPD don't come get me man
You know it's poured up
You know it's throwed up
It ain't a summer Slim Thug ain't showed up
Spend a mansion with Johnny May go go up
Everywhere we go everybody know us
Hood superstars
Like candy on our cars
When you see them fours you gonna know it's those Texas boys
It's summertime in the city
Time to show up
We hit the club
Watch how many bottles blow up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Okay everybody know I will kill
But it seems like my haters done took a chill pill
Even the ones that's real fakers that can real real
The way the bass whipping my styrofoam I know it will spill

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
The pool party hopping got them steaks on the grill
Whole hood participating nobody getting killed
Just a bunch of real niggas trying to smoke and chill
Chopping it up trying to plot up another meal

[Verse 5: Z-Ro & Slim Thug]
Shot all your money, homey don't worry about that
What the fuck you think a real nigga for, I got that
Galleria, we shop that, gotta stay fresh for summer
Throw the slab trunk beating like a drummer

[Hook][Lil Jon voice sample throughout]
"Oh!-Oh!-Oh!-Kaaaayyyyyy"

[Slim Thug]
Slim Thugga! Bun B, T.I.P. baby!
Boss Hogg, Dirty South!

[Hook 2X: Slim Thug]
When I hit the club all the girls show me love
Buying out the bar, got drank by the jug
In the V.I.P. with the chicks and the drugs
This is T-I-P, Bun B and Slim Thug

[Slim Thug]
I got drank by the pint, dro by the pound
Headed to the club and Tha Boss top down
Slim Thug bout the grind, represent H-Town
If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown
Cause me and my Boss Hoggs bout to ball till we fall this year
I won't stall, Slim Thugga want it all
Going solo! first CD out that's not slow mo'
Here's another hit thanks to dranking the do-do
Fa sho though, we got the club shut down
Tryna pick which chick I'm a cut now
Got a fetish for thick girls that's caramel brown
On a hunt and up, guess what I just found
Come in VIP with me boo, while we post up
We blowin purple stuff, we pouring purple stuff
We glowing from wrist up, you can tell that we rich
It's Slim Thugga, T-I-P and Bun B bitch!

[Hook]

[T.I.]
22's on a brand new coupe wit no roof
Hundred fifty dollar tennis shoes, no suits
We some ballers pimp, you oughta be followin our suits
No ad-libbing nigga just do like I do
Don't get it confused, cause dude I'm not you
If you ain't heard the news I'm known as the truth
That's why I'm at the bar buying all this Grey Goose
Passing it to them broads, cause mayne is they loose
That's why nigga Slim Thug, they man what they do
Say the black one a slut, but the red would cut too
Give em numbers to the suites and tell em to fall through
And tell that nigga E.S.G. and Paul Wall too (ohh!)
I know Bun B had been fun wit them freaks (yeah!- yeaaaaah!)
Do it like a G for Screw and Pimp c
From the A but I got all of Houston with me
At the superbowl pulling groups of hoes six deep nigga!

[Hook]

[Bun B]
We going hard in the paint like Carmello (Carmello)
This is for the boys who sip purple and sip yellow (yellow)
Shorty shake ya jelly like J.Lo, she curvy like a jello
Damn baby put me up before I even said hello
Is it the car? is it the ice? is it the grill? (is it the grill)
Cause I'm a star that paid the price to keep it trill (keep it trill)
She at the bar, she lookin nice, she on da pill
And she got two more wit her ready, so tell me how you feel (hold up)
See pimpin ain't made, nigga pimpin ain't raised
Nigga pimpin is born, pimpin since its early days
These niggas get to trippin playa pimpin ain't lazy
And if ya miss Pimp C throw up ya dueces and ya tres (mayne)
We thought of many ways and perfected the grind (grind)
Making million dollas moves, six figga checks we can sign (signed)
Slim Thugga you up next to shine, and I can't even lie
Wit me and T-I-P man you done wrecked 'em this time foo! (time foo)

[Hook][Pharrell Williams]
Ha-ha-ha-hah hah hah hah hah

[Intro - Slim Thug]
Yeah! Yeah! Slim Thugga!
I don't think they ready for this beat
We gon take them boys to Texas right quick

[Verse - Slim Thug]
You know Tha Boss talk shit, walk shit, floss shit
Like it don't cost shit, that's why I'm Tha Boss bitch
Got a million worth of cars, bought a million dollar house
From making words rhyme out my million dollar mouth
You can see the watch gloss when you see Tha Boss walk
I keep my lips closed cause it cost when I talk
I'm so flashy, rims so glassy
Pull the dropper out, we gon show them boys nasty
Hood rats harrass me, I don't want the drama
They wanna get put up so they could be me baby mama
But I'm a chill, I'd rather work wood wheel
And throw them vogues and grills on candy automobiles
I'm still tipping on vogues, closing candy blue doors
From the old caddy coupe to the new blue Rolls
I'm from the hood living good, so I'm pimping
I ain't got my plaque in yet, but I'm already platinum

[Hook - Slim Thug] (2x)
Mayne I'm already platinum
Mayne I'm already platinum
You know I'm already platinum
Mayne I'm already platinum

[Verse - Pharrell Williams]
Skating ass mister, money making ass mister
That Star Trak sign getting way damn bigger
Put Snoop in a coupe, I put Slim in a slab
I put them motherfuckers out wit that one-two jab
Wit the - glamorous jewels, wit the chandelier hues
Everytime I wave my wrist it makes the channel 3 news
In that 100 EX, that two-door shit
Look in my rear view, listen you're too close Thicke
You got it wrong, I don't touch the heaters
Though my Ice Cream sneakers got the drug dealer beepers
Don't let your Ego eat ya, shh! let me teach ya
All that brrrr make ya chest look just like some pizza
Huh!! You see what's happening, we King Kong smashing em
When new bitches is on my arm, the paparazzi is snapping em
The future's ours - and yours is blackening
Me and Tha Boss nigga, we already platinum

[Hook]

[Verse - Pharrell Williams]
You ain't saying shit, you're weak and prom too
I'm making money making beats, and plus I pop too
Playa chill, don't get ya body chopped & screwed
Have ya sucking through a straw just to opt for food
About face and walk our way on too
Let the ladies in here do what they gon do
Seem like my wrist been dipped in diamond fondue
It's not just me, my man got one too

[Verse - Slim Thug]
I got my mind on cash and my grind on smash
Nowadays I gotta count my money by the bags
I done ran through the rags, now I get to see riches
Went from having rats to the superstar bitches
Used to never leave out them Northside blocks
Now I'm going to parties in Miami on yachts
And the grind don't stop, everytime you hear me rapping
Without the plaque in, I'm still already platinum

[Hook]

[Bridge - Pharrell Williams]
It feels so good ma, ma to be platinum
Ha-ha-ha-hah hah hah hah hah
EVS diamonds and Bentley macking
Ha-ha-ha-hah hah hah hah hah
So sick this VSOPN a passion
Ha-ha-ha-hah hah hah hah hah
And after that you and I will be smashing
Ha-ha-ha-hah hah hah hah hahThe Intro

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
All my niggas is gone my damn bitch done cut
I got sum shit on my dome an
Then they love me or what
I'm one deep with my chrome like I ain't giving a fuck
If I got to do this alone fuck it that's wassup
They say it's lonely at the top an you
Gon see who your real friends
No more fo doors I'm riding a coop benz
Keepin it moving ain't focused on shit but not losing
If you don't fuk with me don't fuk with me
It's not confusing
And when you speak on my name watch the words your choosing
You soundin like a hater to me it's so amusing
Instead of moving on trying to do your
Own thang
You recruiting for the we hate Slim Thug gang
But ain't shit change here mayne
I'm still the same
Life good up out the hood shit I can't complain
These niggas say they down but they
Just pretend
I'm ridin solo to the end
Fuk friends

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Sometimes I wonder if god forgot about me
And would my people miss me if they had to do without me
Cause anything ain't no love
A nigga you think is yo homie is runnin up in yo girl everytime you leave her
Lonely
Each and everytime I leave my house all three of my guns is on me
Ain't none of you niggas is goin to
Be kicking or punching on me
And I learned my lesson about callin my homies when I need'em
Out of eleven one and a half
Shows up and the rest I still ain't seen'em
One deep till I'm on my back
Ya'll fellas out might be on my sack
I'll shoot a
Muthafucker if a muthafucker jump out of line then I'm a put'em back in line
2006 forever gloc 40 with hollows in mind
It's amazing how something so small can flip yo bitch ass anytime
I'm an og original gangster mayne organized general
Army ready to drop off chemicals
64 545 criminals
But it's buisness
Whenever I'm seen with a crowd that I'm not feeling
Enter the conversation and paper in my pocket I'm not feeling

[Hook: Z-Ro]

[Verse 3: J-Dawg]
I done seen a whole lot in these 26 years
Never thought I had peers that was undercover queers
Tell these snitches in my
Circle awhile back I wuld've murked yuh
I vouch for me an mine
Till the gavel drop down
An judge gave my time since I hogged up
The ripper
The last time I heard from my niggas
Still in denial in the begginin of my sentence
Two months turned to years and them years
Turned to bitches
Sittin in my cell doin sets of push ups
No money no mail that's okay that's wassup
Momma made a man but these streets raised
A soldier
Where they kill a real nigga make a mo daycloder
I never fold up
I'm a do my time bitch
I'm a make parole ho
Get out and shine trick
You fuck niggas better stay out my way
I awready wanna blow off yo face
For violating the code nigga

[Hook: Z-Ro]Slim Thug flow but you nuggin’ at the best

[Verse 1 : Slim Thug]
Believe me, it’s easy
‘Cause everything I say you see
Down in H Town in 3D
Ain’t nothing fake ‘bout a G
Said all I talk about is cars
My cribs and my ménages with broads
My bad, if all y’all frauds
I was tryna keep it real, man, fuck how you feel
Made a whole lot of money, got a lot more coming
Through messing with them bob swings, got me a
Woman
Old G in the game, still keep it one hundred
If I ain’t the best rapper, I’m the number one stunner
In my city
They try to act like they don’t see me but I be in they
Face like TV
Stay on the radio all day and all night
Man, ho, look, bring that back, be right
Slim Thug, flow tox, slow so you hear me
Underground boss, other rappers ain’t near me
Made it my career, yeah, I still say give me
Did it my way, still ain’t changed clearly
No stress, still blessed
Stepping out the crib, half a mil’ on my chest
You ain’t gotta like me but my momma still
Impressed
That I moves us out the hood and we ain’t moved
Back yet


Slim Thug flow but you nuggin’ at the best
(Till Fade)[Intro: Trae - chopped & screwed]
Chyeah, 'knowmtalmbout?
You ain’t shit if you ain’t screwed up, fo' real

[Z-Ro] + (Trae) + {Both}
Houston, Texas, home of DJ Screw, we say know’m saying and what it do?
(And if a nigga don’t like it, tell them bitches I rep Texas, topless, in the slab I come thru)
Elbow and Vogues and expensive clothes, candy-paint car our cars, big booties on our hoes
(Got diamonds in our mouth, still represent the south, put the truck up bitch, I’m swanging four’s)
I sip codeine out the styrofoam, 27-10 is the kinda grind on
{I ain’t ever love a bitch, so I’m riding alone, prolly when them niggas ain’t on the kind of shine I’m on}
Big dully trucks with the big rims, and the Cadillac with the fifth wheel
(We from the hood and we keep steel, if you try to jack them you’re gonna get killed)
I don’t wear my britches tight, I wear them loose
Active Athlete for all my footwear, homie I got too many shoes
{I’m the man in my city, tell them niggas I won’t lose}
{Cross that path, and my nigga Hawk, we still gon’ chunk the deuce}

[Hook: Trae - chopped & screwed]
You can me in the hood in the city that I claim
Moving slow, like the music that I bang, screwed-screwed up!
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Gla-glass underneath, beatin’-beatin', my block
Pop-pop my trunk, chain-chain fulla rocks
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas
Bitch I’m from Texas, yeah, bitch I’m from Texas

[Paul Wall]
You can find me in h-o-u-s-t-o-n, ridin' in
Candy trim, on pokey rims, wit a ten and her friend
Trae the truth, ridin’ right behind, two cups full and I’m on my grind
Talkin’ dine, respect my mind, I'll show you boys how Texas get dine
Rolex time, top lift back, on my nuts, cuz I got that sack
Papered up to the roof, it stacked, hoes wanna hate but it don’t mean jack
Wheres there’s money that’s where I’m at, that Texas grind, that’s all I know
Bangin’ screw and drankin’ Big Moe, basically get that dough, bro

[Slim Thug]
Northside, where the boss ride, e'ry day I got play outside (huh?)
Leavin’ them haters mouth wide, can't be denied when they see me slide
Through the hood like I live there, shit, I got a few cribs there
All my G’s still chill there, we barbecuin' them ribs there (huh? What?)
Smoke blunts and sip punch like its lunch, every day we do it
Listenin’ to nothin but Texas music, perfect match for that good fluid
Find me in the hood, in the city I claim, everybody dine in H-town know me mayne
It ain't a choice, I can’t change, I'mma rep the north like I gangbang (Thugga)

[Hook]

[Kirko Bangz]
Uhh, I gotta bad ass bitch, parked outside
Yella diamond my wrist, if it’s dark outside
Pull a lil’ bitch then I catch ghost, just a lil’ kid from the ghetto
Never had shit but I got a lil’ bit, when I got a couple hits under this belt
Throw a H up, nigga, I ain’t tryna belch or nothin’, ain't got a whole lotta money but I'm wealthy money
I sip a whole lottta drank but I'm healthy mami, daddy was cool, but he couldn’t really tell me nothin'
Uhh~!... Everybody think a nigga lucked up
Young Kirko, he done blew up, from the H-town, nigga what’s up?

[Bun B]
I’m Port Author, Texas, let’s get that straight off the top
That’s where the hustlin’ and grindin’ and the hatin’ don’t stop
From the westside to east, we out here duckin’ them cops
And coming dine, candy paint, on them motherfuckin’ chops
It’s the land of the trill, that’s where the whole thang came from
And it just a word, or where a rapper get his name from
It’s a way of life, and we live to the fullest
For years, we represent it with blood sweat and bullets
Ho, I’m from Texas!

[Hook][Slim Thug]
Rarely barely, seen in two different places
But I made a mistake, my best friend was fake
I had to separate, the real from the snakes
You broke my heart dog, with all that jealousy
I couldn't believe, the shit that they was telling me
I understand your pain, the whole scene changed
But it wasn't personal, it was a green thang
You was never left behind, nigga get that out your mind
But when you thought it was your time, you left me behind
I held my ground, and when your chance didn't go down
Nigga I got mine, and flipped the shit around
It still ain't no hard feelings, I still want you to get millions
But I just can't never see, me and you chilling
We headed two different ways, I'm still trying to get paid
Why you po'ing up blowing up, wasting your days

[Hook]
We use to get money together, pull honeys together
Pushing chromed out twinkies, in custom coached leather
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever
Cause this is business, it ain't personal
Same dream, same team, same teams
We even told, to the same damn things
Ain't no rules in this war, for this green
This is business, and it ain't personal[Verse 1]
All I do is get money , fuck hoes ride clean
Smoke big weed , keep a pint of that lean
Got bad bitches cashin foreign of that lot
Your bitch love Thug , cause Thug doing what you not
I live a Boss Life five hoes no wife
Keep  em swapping out
Shaking ass like dice
I see you looking baby ain’t these diamonds looking nice
She say how much it cost
I told her mo’ than your life

[Hook]
I live a boss life bitch I live a boss life
I live  a boss life , that's right I live a boss life

[Verse 2]
I’m in the club getting fucked up
Celebratin’ while you hatin’
Your girl in my section while you home masturbatin’
I like strip clubs and strippers that turn up
And like Boston Georgia got a motherfucking plug
Rep H-Town and I do this shit the best
They talking shit but I bag it with them chicks
Clean like a drug dealer I only roll with thug niggas
Been shining so long they wanna  kill us cause bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And everything paid out from the cribs to the cars
And I own my masters y'all slaves spitting bars
Put plenty niggas on took my hood around the world
Still one hunnid them boys been acting like girls
Been grinding nigga
That's how I'm still shining nigga
You boys just rhyming nigga
I see them bullshit diamonds nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I got a yard full of foreign cars, while you boys still leasing
Yeah he rap good, but your money ain't increasing
In my penthouse, letting your bitch see the view
She say I'm getting money, I say that ain't nothing new
I live a boss life, tell your boss come get at me
Cribs coast to coast, good luck trying to catch me
Got a lot of tens, and they job to keep my happy
Treat me like a king, never let a bitch trap me

[Hook][Intro]

[Verse 1]
It's Slim Thugga muthafucka, got a lot to sell
But snitches already got a lot to tell
So far as y'all know all I do is just rap
And give these streets something they can play in they trap (cheyah)
Last year I had to put my city back on the map
This year we goin hit em right back with a slap (that's right)
I had the whole wide world tippin' on 4's (fo's)
Sippin' on drank, using gland slow
Claiming they the boss I guess they like my style
Copyin what I do, mayne they like my child
I'm listening like damn mayne them boys wild
Thinking to myself, mayne them boys foul
Bitin' everything from my slang to my smile (damn)
Thought I was goin let it slide... hell naw!
If the shoe fit wear it, listen to it compare it
You niggas ain't my fam, how my style you inherit

[Hook]
I call all shots, all wins no losses (no losses)
Follow me, I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses [x4]
Ha, fuck what'cha heard, fuck what they talking
They follow me I'm the boss of all bosses
I'm the boss of all bosses [x4]

[Verse 2]
Ha
H-Town, trendsetta I'mma lead the way
The only rapper doing everything I say
Them other boys fiction (ha), grew up bein Christians (ha)
I'm a good dude, I just gotta alot addictions (that's right)
I love getting money you can see it in my face
It's like I'm bout to bust when I stuff my safe (cheyah)
I love getting pussy but I hate these hoes (I hate these hoes)
I'm bout to hit the block and -drop the top on 4's-
I know you probably tired of hearing about my cars (I know)
That's what'cha get for turning hood niggas to stars (that's what'cha get)
What the fuck you would do if you was me?
Never had shit now you rich as you can be (what)
Used to hit lick's selling bricks in the streets (ha)
Now I'm selling hits for ten times the fee (ha ha)
And stayin' free, I ain't seein' no jails
The boss of the south gon stay giving them hell (ha)

[Hook][T.I.]
Hey what it is pimpin
Slim Thug and T.I.P. doing it B.I.G with B.I.G (yea a ye yeaah..)
Ya understand what I'm saying (hey..)
P.S.C. pimpin!
Y'all already know what it is man, its a bad boy thing man
Grand hustle collaboration, Y'all already know man
Boss Hog whats happening (hey..)
A-Town pimpin!

[Slim Thug]
Slim Thugga!
I roll strapped Glock 40 in my lap
I rap but still think like I'm grinding in the trap
Trying to adapt to the change from the streets to the game
Can't be selling CD's and still selling dem thangs
Cause snitches drop names and bring alot of problems
And putting somthing in they head the only way you gonna solve em'
Jackas stay plotting watching your every move
And the minute you snooze will be the minute you lose, dude
Thats the rules so I cruise with the tools
To fix the damn fools that think I'm slipping with my jewels
Breakin old habits so hard to do
Thats why you see me on the same block with the same crew
And everybody sitting fat living good
And I'm the only nigga that be rapping in my hood
I was raised by the hustlas, and ganged by the G's
And taught by the bosses how to stack that cheese

[T.I.] [Hook]
You got rich and G shit is still a part of you
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
You still watch for the haters and the robbing crew
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When on shot that nigga like I started to
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out the dealership crackin open cigars in the coupe
Man cause breakin old habits so hard to do

[Biggie]
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
Than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggas with punany, like Connie
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flying in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rentals

[Hook]

[T.I.]
I used to drive a Chevy Monte Carlo, bricks of blow all in it
I was taught to sell the shit, you put your nose all in it
Let my bitch drive the Benz but the Rolls off limits
How you call yourself pimpin, with hoes all in your buisness
What it is, the music business or the streets make a decision
I do this in my sleep, and you way out your division pimp
This game we play for keeps, and the rules remain hidden
This ain't a place for lames and that snitching shit is forbidden
After sitting in the kitchen and whipping with hopes of getting back
All that off a brick to go blow it, so it even 50 stacks
And now I'm sitting back, thinking about a time
When a nigga get a 100 g's, think he went down
But now look for loyalty in the game, it ain't there
And things ain't the same they changed it ain't fair
Real niggas dead, doing their time and ain't here
You commit the same crime and come home the same year

[Hook][Intro: Slim Thug]
Thugga
Sound like some Snoop shit
We making some Thug shit

[Verse: Slim Thug]
I'm one deep in that 'lac laid back, cruising
Came a long way from that north side of Houston
I'd never know one day I'd make it out of this trap
Or that I'd get rich off of making up a rap
Momma watching TV, brother cooking crack
Sister 14 and pregnant and that's facts
All my life and shoot and said night
But instead of being scared, I'm trying see the fight
We used to it cause everyday they do it
Momma thinking we dead, about to lose it
Always been a boss, never took orders
Good thing, unlike my other partners, I was smarter
When they was getting locked up, I'm grinding more harder
Half on the block, the other half on recorders
And who knew one day folks would use it
To ride and get high to, it's that cadillac music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]
It's the Cadillac music
And I hope that you can use it
If you don't have a Fleetwood
You can jam it in your Hooptie
Put it in and just ride, ride, ride
Put it in and just ride, ride, ride

[Verse: Devin The Dude]
Now this is the type of shit you have a slight lean when you ride to
Especially if you got some tight weed like I do
Cadillac creeping with the fresh brown leather
Old school simply cause the shit sound better
Seventies, just leave them be
You feeling the vibe - Ah Ah Stayin' Alive
Ohio player type shit, sugar pudding
Scooping up fine freaks fuck wuggah woofin
And I'm looking for a spot where I can chill and whatnot
When they ain't tripping on me smoking on the kill that I've got
And that's every club parking lot here that's jumping
I roll up, say hold up, bitch, stop bumping and get in
Take a spin with your boy in the Caddy
Guess I'm just a player, not a pimp, I'm not your daddy
Just a nigga that'll put some dick in ya
And I know that you can use it while you're listening to Cadillac music

[Hook: Devin The Dude]

[Verse: Dre Day]
Uh, uh, cheyeah
Why these laws keep harrassing?
They ain't got nothin better to do than put us blacks and
Ese's

On my way from freeway to the presidential suite
And b you lookin' weak without chrome feet
And if you ain' got candy then yo ride ain' complete

Yep
A lot of people said that I would not last
'Cuz I'ma Dade County off of 15th ave
You remember Mr. Wonderful, that's my dad
Kept my toes on marble flo's, swimmin' in cash
My mama name 'Nessa, taught me the game
16 ladies rollin with a fly ass chain
Use to ride through the city, in hollywood benz
God blees the dead, I'ma see you again
I was the baddest at the west, I'll take yo man
I sneak him into Strawberry's after pack jam
Or Miami Nights, at Miami nights
We was up all night, till they cut the street lights
But now I been crowned as the queen
M-I-YAYO home of the triple beam, ya' mean
DJ Khaled put it on
Diamond Princess, a star is born
I'm on my grown, yes

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Yea, Yea, Yea What up Khaled
Ay, I'm pullin' up in somethin' you should take a picture of
Liftin' up the lambo do's, go and give yo chick a hug
Paint wetter than the suds in ya kitchen cuz
Larger than a dove, and it don't feel like O.J. Simpsons glove
Reincarnate Picaso out of the grave
And still couldn't compete with the way my ride is sprayed
Rims stayin' on the run like a runaway slave
The top is chop-chop, like a summer day fade
Vallet be slippin' slidin' when they standin' by this caddy
My paint wet (yup) watch it do the trick daddy
Me and E got fly rides, if you want it then get at me
If it fit then I don't want em they suppose to fit barely
I made straight As in spanish Khaled they must have forgot though
(Khaled:How many cars Koopa?) Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Add another cuatro, I got another drop so
I'm buildin' a garage on top of the one I got (oh)
Tell the maker of the Chevy that I'm ridin' silly (silly)
Turn it up, heavy bass'll make it pop a wheelie
I know my cheese is at stake but I'm not from Philly
Jackers watchin', plottin', so Chamilly went and cop a milly

Pimp C in my cassette deck
Pimp C in my cassette deck
I'm just wait too trill
I live way too trill
Born to hustle like I'm Chad Butler
And you know I keep a tall cup a'
Time to pop me a pill
I'm just way too trill
I'm ridin dirty in my Benzo
I'm pimpin women, I got ten hoes
Bumpin a "Pocket Full of Stones"
And you know I'm smoking strong
You know my partners put me on
I'm callin' Bun B on the phone
Cause my nigga so dope
And all my nigga sold dope
Huh!

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I ain't..it's something real
Someone feel the..
Pimp C in my cassette deck
I ain't..that's something real
Pimp C in my cassette deck
Someone feel..

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Pimp C in my cassette deck, bangin out of my head set
Talkin about some pussy that he left with it
And killed it like a death threat
This is the life of a jet set
But jazzy yella boppers that you just met
Bust it open and leave your bed wet
This is the life of a king
Money and power and jewelry that bling
Bitches that bathe you and kiss on your rings (they kiss on your rings?)
Amongst other things, we got cars that cost like a house
Houses that cost like a sub-division
Pitchin I see and I love the position
So know when you rep, this thug on a mission
I'm trillin than most, realer than all
Haters watchin but still I'm a ball
Put your name up with RIP on the wall
From gladiators that I kill if I call
We got work in the walls
The money is under the floor
And the guns in every room
And they light yo ass up if you come to the door
Better know PA is the town
Repping for life and I'm holding it down
Give a fuck if you like how it sound
Cause Port Arthur Texas ain't fucking around
So I'm coping my top leading my fifth poppin my trunk
Chucking the deuce while I'm sipping my juice
And I'm turning it up bitch I'm getting the crunk

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Pimp C in my cassette deck, Cad' paint drippin wet
Hundred thou' on my neck, pay cash, no check
Rip microphones like I'm sweet James Jones
See, I can't believe that my nigga Pimp gone
Chrome spokes pokin' out the side of the Caddy
Keep a set of sexy yellas ridin with daddy
But it's for the money, never for the honey
I'm a trill nigga she can't get shit from me
I make them hoes pay me, pimpin bought me this Mercedes
Ever since I was a baby had them ladies going crazy
Ain't got a pimp cup but I got a sip cup
Doubled up muddy, full of that purple stuff
That Big Moe, that Pimp C, that DJ Screw, trill niggas feel me
And I'mma stay trill till a nigga kill me
Even after that I still be forever known trill

[Hook][Verse 1: Scarface]
I'm on the highway, buzzed from the contact
Her body nice, but her face look like a wombat
Guess where her tongue's at? All in my earhole
Breath smelling like warm beer, what a weirdo
Now look at here, ho, that shit is aggravating
I don't kiss 'em on the first date, but her imagination's
Running wild; this must have been her first time ghosting
And now she's got her nipples out, top's down, posting
Blunt still smoking, burning up my white seats
Pulling on my cargo's, trying to get to my Lee
I like the white freaks, they lawless when they go down
Hanging out my sunroof, panting to her toes now
I got to get up on the latest ho-down
Called up the other bitch I'm fucking, let her show out
I rarely go out, but when I do I'm whipping something rimmed-up
Two hundred forty thou, gripping real
Wood grain steering wheels
Y'all niggas tripping, I am FaceMob mobbing
All in the pimping
My nigga listen, I am still bout that dumb shit
South Side of H-Town, fuck where I'm from, bitch
I'll give you one wish, but after that it's lights out
And I am not James Toney, get the ice out
Cause I will dot them eyes like a student do
Style so versatile I'm confusing you
That's what the dude'll do, word to the motherfucker
Started off one way, switch it to the other
Cause a cold nigga do what the others can't do
Monotone-type rappers, what the fuck they gonna do?
Coming through

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
Something new -- white, black, or that blue
Bad bitch sitting in it; she ain't mine, she fuck crew
We do this shit for practice, million in my mattress
Pull up in the projects sounding off with an actress
Believe me, I done it; damn right I stunted
Had her up in Dreams late night, getting blunted
Still keep it one hundred, and not a nickel short
Ask anybody over on that Northfield vault
Used to call me Young Boss, now they call me O.G
And half the niggas call me that older than me
Been getting mine for a long time, hustling since a teen
But now I get to relax, kick back like a king
Still fiend for the paper, so the hustle don't stop
Can't never go broke, I'm too used to rolling drop
Too used to balling knots, spending racks at the mall
You know it costs to shop, fifty six, six tall
Too big to do it small
Sorry for all the capping
But I'm still real surprised on how much I made rapping
Thought I'd be outside trapping like everybody else
Never thought I'd be standing here by myself
My best friend locked, the other got shot
Couldn't even fuck with him, mayne, he robbed the whole block
And I'm the one not, who ain't that hard to spot
Fucking with them, I would've been got popped
Gotta watch out for haters that grow with success
Don't be weak for bitches, they only bring stress
Keep the Lord on my chest, and gold on my chain
I'mma stay real forever, I never ever change, mayne

[Verse 3: M.U.G.]
All I do is chase, all I want is cake
I just want to touch a mil before my death day
So I rarely sleep, but I'm always awake
Because I'm thinking of more ways I can load up the safe
I know I ain't living safe
I gotta keep my heater loaded to the max
So prepare when them jackers try to come attack
Hollow-tip and infrared beam comes attached
Mashing through my neighborhood dressed in all-black
Matter of fact, it's orange and some navy blue
I cannot describe these streets, it's a crazy zoo
Niggas dying; keep your strap cause it may be you
Mama burned a G, June 3rd, '82
I make my moves so police don't got a clue
I needs mine C.O.D. cause my rent due
Hard times ain't shit, we gon get through
Long as them dollar bills we get big to

[Hook: M.U.G.]
All I do is chase
If you ain't talking paper, move around from my space
Cause I'm trying to get my bank like Chase
All I wanna see is Ben Franklins in my face
So all I do is chase
We get money, fuck bitches
All I do is chaseSwizz Beatz DC Destiny Child Slim Thug

[Slim Thug]
You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas
Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

[Hook]
Ohh boy you looking like you like what you see

If you got flaunt it, boy I know you want it
While I turn around you watch me check up on it
Oohhh you watchin me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin, you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it

You think that I'm teasin, but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 2]
I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gone make you chase it
You've got to be patient, I like my men patient
More patience, you take my get you in more places
You can't be abrasive, has to know to pace it
If I let you get up on it, you gotta make a promise
That you gon' put it on me, like no one's put it on me
Don't bore me, just show me, all men talk but don't please
I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you

[Hook] - 2X

[Single Version--Slim Thug]
I'm checking on you boo, do what you do
And while you dance I'mma glance at this beautiful view
To keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
If won't hurt if you gon' try one time
They all hot, but let me see this one's mine
It's Slim Thuga and DC outta H-Town

[Video Version--Bun B]
Well it's the King of the Underground, and the King of the Trill
Standin' on the top of the South like the King of the Hill
You're tuned into a winner that's never takin' a loss
Reppin' Houston with Beyoncé and Slim Thug The Boss
Diamonds on the wood peel, I'm a Dirty South Soldier
Draped up and dripped out homie, I thought I told ya...
I llike your wiggle and the way that you work it
But no touchin', just watchin' you twerk it, I'm checkin' up on you tonight!

[Verse - Pusha T]
Big home, big car, big jewelry
Whispers in the street, all the talk of robbery
Ain't no Quad Studio, 2Pac and P
For every watch there's a Glock, come shop with me
Hood DVDs the closest you get to TV
BE or MT, the whole world done see me
VH1 Behind the Scenes, there's bout to be a three-peat
So keep on rewinding your part and others try and defeat me
Strap like the movie, better yet the sequel
Strap Before Rap, we'll call that the prequel
I told ya wit the pen, there shall be none equal
But since he ain't write it, that makes him more lethal! UUSSSHH!!

[Hook]

[Verse - Slim Thug]
I was taught only reach for the heat if you busting
So when lift this shirt that's the end of discussion
Click clack motherfuckers! - I ain't trying to hear nothing!
If you smart you gon hit the ground running and ducking
A lot of rap niggas be trying to play hard
Knowing damn well that they lying and they fraud
They talk that hard shit when somebody press record
When there's beef in the streets they run to their body guard
I'm still a hood nigga, you can catch me on the block
And when I'm the club you can catch me wit the Glock
I know them jackas plotting trying to catch me wit a knot
But we gon see if them laws can come catch me when he's shot

Niggas say I'm fuckin all these bitches cuz a nigga famous

Women touch me, she fucked she loved me
I fucked her on her honeymoon, once at her wedding
Say it in a church then I got a confession

I hit two times then I learned my lesson
Then she hit me up two times it ain't up for discussion

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
Coming down, extra bucks

P.I.M.P I ain't tryin to date a bitch

[Hook x3][Hook:]
Living life in the hardest city
Understand where I'm coming from
Understand where I'm coming from

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
This where the gangstas survive
And bitch niggas died
Somebody from your block got, got, you gotta ride
Where the bitches suspicious that's why you can't trust em
Pimp, steal, hell you might not wanna fuck em
The block is on fire, them laws want you locked
Even if you pay the hustle they take the little that you got
When niggas get shot, and it ain't no big deal
Cause everybody took what even if they get killed
It's hard to cry for 'em we're so used to it live everyday like it's our last
It's like that nigga knew it
Robbing and stealing, hustling and killin'
Serve that, I just smile, living with no villain
Where they so tired of starvin' they'd rather be in jail
They go home and after tell their kids they failed
I'm from the South side of Houston, where everybodys strapped
But I love my hood so I put it on the map

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:  Big KRIT]
I come from the rock bottom, trains and steel mills
My partner fuck school, he'd rather rock chrome wheels
Babys been having babies like condoms they never made 'em
Give them up to their parents cause surely they couldn't raise 'em
Let the curtain fall fuck the laws and the judge
Sendin' niggas up the creek for selling drugs they gave to us
My grandma always used to say cherish what you love
Cause God is comin' soon for me and you to take us up above
They hollin' change here but I got bills due
So pardon me when Imma eat and I don't feel you
Just let me smoke my weed and drank upon this chill brew
And reminisce on life when it was laid back and chill too
I'm still pourin out for partners that did pass
But never pour too much cause I try to make it last
Make do with what I got I appreciate what I have
If you ain't searchin' for the truth then why you asked
Mississippi where I'm comin' from

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: J-Dawg]
I'm from the home of religion where they searching for a way
Where they sent you far away
And they got less than any but still got the most faith
Home of the G's, land of the slaves
Rest in peace and much respect to all my G's that passed away
And on that note I lost two more the other day
Where the good die young and the kids duck strays
On the way to school jumpin' over blood pools
You can smell it in they clothes, its like the Devil's burnt through
And they immune to it, how is this normal?
Where the babies get burned and preachers call that karma
See where I'm from they will tell us anything
Like fuck it if we crash, they just want us out they lane
Yeah man, that's a motherfucking shame
And every gutter is the same, but different motherfuckin' drain
I'm from the slums, gorilla red off chromes (?)
Where you better not come, rich niggas get done
And the bricks bitch, ugh![Hook x2: Kirko Bangz]
I hold my cup up, I let my top down
And everywhere I look they pourin' up now
Say shout out to them Texas niggas, Texas niggas
I do this shit for Texas, nigga

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Bitch, I hear ya talkin'
You about that shit, then take that off
Fake ass niggas gotta lay down
Reppin' H-Town, now a nigga can't play that off
Niggas came down to the city, stole from the city
Hoes from the city like "play that song"
These rap niggas know I'm the new nigga
But no nigga gotta put Kirko on
Bitches know I'm 'bout it, man
Love the way that I swang that chrome
I be all in her body man
Every bitch that I fuck, I own
Uh, while you be tryna marry the bitch
Ain't tryna burn, but this money I'm tryna bury quick

[Bridge: Kirko Bangz]
Ooh, I'm sippin' on that purple stuff
Ho, I ain't 'bout to pour you up
Ooh, I'm sippin' on that purple stuff
Nigga, I ain't 'bout to pour you up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
When I hold my cup up, it's just like lifting weights
Look like I'm chewin' instead of sippin' because this is an 8
I don't want no soda, homie, I'd rather sip it straight
I'm an OG out that screwed up clique
King of the Ghetto, this is my name
I be rollin' on swangers with candy black paint on 'em
If it rain, still ain't gon' get a stain on 'em
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I talk
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I walk
Six-piece wing dinner from Frenchy's
King of the ghetto, ain't never been friendly
Just put eleven more ounces in me
Whenever you see me, my cup ain't empty
So many fifteens, so many twelves, so many 6-5-9s
I'm bangin' so hard, everybody else bangin'
But I don't give a fuck if they park by mine
I've got a thunder trunk
I keep coughin' cause I smoke thunder skunk
I've got the lightning dick, I need thunder cunt
And I dare any one of y'all niggas to mess with Texas
Texas gon' fuck you up

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
First they steal your lighter, then they steal your style
Fat Pat is my idol, I've got twenty bands on my smile
Forgot to pay they homage, they just reuse and recycle
Man, they lie so much that they don't know the truth
But they'll swear to God on the Bible
I don't know where they do that at
But it damn sure ain't in Texas
Ridin' in the 'Lac down 45, I-10 is my exit
I do this shit for the city, swangin'
I've got wood grain in my Leffries
Pimp C is the greatest
Motherfucker, talkin' down is a death wish
Codeine is my fetish - pourin' up is a way of life
Legend stealer, Jerome Bettis
You punk sipper ain't drakin' it right
8 or all, that's a day in the life
Open trunk, and array of lights
They used to say this was local shit
Now everywhere drinkin' muddy Sprite
Pour up...

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Slim Thug]
I rep for Texas, nigga
You gon' respect us, nigga
We got ya sippin' out them white cups like Texas niggas
Got ya shinin' diamond grills like them Texas niggas
Rappers screwed up and chopped like them Texas niggas
You get the message, nigga? So chop some checks up with us
Them broads be tryna get us, cause they know we them niggas
She love my Texas swag, and how I keep it G
Let her roll in the slab, she wanna be seen with me
I tell her pay that fee, it's pimpin' with me, mane
Ask any bitch in Texas, ain't no sippin' with me, mane
Still drippin' candy stains, got that drink by the pint
Cause I'm a Texas nigga, what we do Kurt Cobain

[Hook][Hook: Slim Thug]
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off
So what you saying ho?
You know I'm the man ho?

[Verse: Slim Thug]
I had to cut that bitch off that's what you get for playin' ho
I'm all about my grams ho, make me more stupid
And if you can't you useless like Chris Brown I'm throwin' deuces
Gotta keep my car coupeish if you wanna be my new bitch
They be like Thugga you rich why we still gotta do this
I don't fuck with no broke bitches only fuck with hustlers
How you fine with no money better go get some customers
I fuck 'em but don't trust 'em
I cut 'em but don't love 'em
Got pimpin' in my blood always put my money abve 'em
I see you lames cuffin' , but you ain't stopping nothing
Got your bitch in my bed givin' head 'til I'm busting
She say she got a rush fucking with a thug nigga
She say she tired of losing fucking with them scrub niggas
She say them tricks only good for buyin' new kicks
So she break 'em for their bread, then hop back on daddy dick
