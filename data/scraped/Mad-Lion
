[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a RastaToo many suckas an not a nuff time

Dats why[Intro]
You know, you don't see with your eyes
You see with your brain
And the more words your brain has
The more things you can see

[Verse 1]
Yes yes y'all, it don't stop, it can't stop, it won't stop
We used to be there rapping on the block
It was like Hip Hop would never stop
But then we all got older, and a little bit bolder
The streets of New York got a little bit colder
I'm a young dude, I gotta learn and get over
1980, Brooklyn is crazy in the dark
But there I am in Wingate Park
Jamming to the DJs creating this art
I'm on E, but I'm free and I wanna be part
So I gotta be smart and then it just sparked
I'mma start with my heart, achieving the mark
Of being the number one MC on the chart
So on your mark get ready go
I Rock Steadied the show with DJ Scott La Rock, you already know
Yo, these were the days when bands were elected
Based on the jams they selected so check it
This man got respected
When fans detected that the South Bronx
Was the new answer record

[Hook]
And just like that, just like that, just like that
I speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
My dreams they did appear so
Just like that, just like that, just like that
You speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
Your dreams they will appear so

[Verse 2]
Just like that I was right on top
Me and Scott La Rock but then Scott La Rock got shot
I can hear him echoing Hip Hop don't stop
But we was getting robbed like a bank with no lock
By a record company that was taking a lot
People blaming us and shaming us, but then it all stopped
When By All Means Necessary dropped
It was like the whole damn Hip Hop culture stopped
But that's when the vultures dropped, from the culture shock
Because we was showing people how they supposed to rock
With their hands in the air and they mouth on scream
But in '81 this was just a dream
But we kept dreaming, kept decreeing, kept seeing
Kept being Hip Hop, breaking, MCing
Graffiti writing, DJing on the weekend
It's the proper use of your mind I'm teaching

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just like that, I began to see
The true force and the power of M-I-N-D
Now I am free and yes I can be
The amazing MC I saw in 81
Back then I was the crazy one
Even the lazy one, the not sure, the maybe one
Now today I'm the sure one, the on tour one
The raw one, the one you want more from
But it was all a dream
Now this brother's on the cover of Word Up magazine
Hanging fliers on my wall
Boogie Down Productions vs MC Shan and Marley Marl
You know my tape rocks, I don't say pop
If I couldn't find OE, then I got the Private Stock
Way back where them Dapper Dan jackets at
With the hat to match, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Just like that, now it's '91
And the West Coast Era now has just begun
And you can't run, crack cocaine affects everyone
Now we know the military, they brought in several tons
Forget them old guns they brought in better ones
The name of this new game is stack your set of ones
For me I remember 1981
When I first wanted to rap it was mainly fun
But Hip Hop was made to run
So them dudes that think it's all about money their day will come
And it comes for many, and it's scary
To learn your whole career was really temporary
But on the contrary we can look at the past
And see the major recording artists that didn't last
But here comes the blast, in order to last
Be the real you, man, take off the mask

[Hook][Hook] x2
So if you think you're too old
Your thinking that you're too cold
You gave up on your true goals
The system gotcha
I'm giving you a new soul
You're never ever too old
To manifest your true goals
Or the system gotcha

[Verse 1]
You're never too old to sell a key
So how could you be too old to emcee?
I'm from where it originated so get me
Why would I stop what I created, even at sixty?
Shout out to Herc and Cindy
Hip hop lifts me and never left me
You know where KRS be
Right there where the best be
When I spit a free I can't help it if that's how God blessed me
So I'm never empty, writer's block never tempts me
With twenty albums I mastered this evidently
So I ask you gently
You don't see how to spot me on the block with my classic medley?
I can't stop, people won't let me
I don't talk sexy, but I do come correctly and you can check me
But just don't compare me to the next G
KRS-ONE: when you get older you'll respect me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I keep it moving all over the country
Doing underground spots with the ceiling above me
I keep it dark and ugly, microphone crusty
We will be here forever; trust me
I rock the spots that be dusty and banged out
I do house parties, raves and gang hangouts
Others took the same route, we didn't take the main route
You know who they are, I ain't gotta call they name out
They superstars, but in 1986 you ain't know who we are
And notice when I said "who we are", as opposed to "who we were"
Cause the past and future already occurred, but it was blurred
Time reversal symmetry just occurred
My being is timeless if the future remembers me
And there's no end to me, word!
Past and future happen at the same time, especially in the memory
We share the same mind. Images of my future telling me the same sign
In 1983 who I'd be in '09, but it's past 2011 and I flow fine
Rapping at 70? Believe that it's no crime
These youngins rent they style, I own mine
As you can see, I don't be relying on my old rhymes
I'm spitting raw rhymes, right here, right now
25 years, I never put the mic down[Intro]
"One two, testing one two
Alright party people in the place to be
The party has already started
An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*"

[Verse 1]
Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
Where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom, chill
As I rock em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, still, number one I hype it
Your album, rewrite it

[Hook]
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC

[Verse 2]
Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
Will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak! My grammar
With stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
And crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
While poetically recriminate you like a child I will
Get ill, and switch to earn
Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
Be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter
Fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
*cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
"Yo Kris you hit too hard" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is "Who let the K out?"
No grey area
Everything is black and white we took the gray out its scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
Is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
Your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me? No no no no no no NO!

[Hook]

[Mad Lion: Outro]
If a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!
BDP crew get up in that ass like a piece of toilet tissue
General Lion I chase them all and I am on fiyah
Represent the hardest crew, you know how we do
Anything tess, dead! Gun shot to dem head
Gwan *echoes*[Mad Lion] *singing to the tune "Walk Like an Egyptian"*
Who wan come try, dis-respect

[KRS-One]
You don't realize the magnitude I laugh at you
Flappin you rat-a-tat, you on your own avenue
While I'm slappin you, askin you, "Why you actin new?"
Crushin a mack and you turnin up the black in you
Skill for skill you the minor we the major
I grade your whole album like a mad term paper...
ZERO, don't be a fan! Like DeNiro
Be a teacher, be a role model, be a hero
Get it clear yo, I be rollin with de po-sse
Now do your plan over or get, ran over

[Mad Lion]
I be crusin down the highway, just sportin in the fly way
Turn it up a notch and de sound hits dem
Creepin through traffic with the sunroof open
To ventilate the scent from the spliff we smokin
Huff with a chop we do not
We make up a mighty powder, said scrap, last week!
We close in the Jeep, no fire for sleep
Dem come rough and make you one of dem weak or
In de dance kill a watch like chicken in my pot
Call dem with de champagne, can't stop that's right!
Man of been to dem place, to champagne away
Sign of money, can virus strike

"I see you move..."
Look now man, look look
"I see you move..."
I think it's time for it

[Shaggy]
Who dat from the chat with the boom shot
Hit you with the lyrical bash, so won't last
Rudebwoy check your stash, caught the cash
And if you don't like dat, somebody gettin bitch-slapped
I'm the raggamuffin with the Dream Team
KRS, Mad Lion guaranteed to make your money scream
(See? All you need) rhythmatical style
(Need) ya done gwan irie, peep
Pump ya best if ya irie, like me
Cause we don't want know si-ren, hey
Nuff a rhyme works, nobody gets hurt
Look up on the dancefloor, herd of nothin but skirts
Fellas in the club, actin like vi-pers
Bitin them girls like your name was Marv Albert
Baby love no fighting, come to back biting
You and your girlfriend should do the right thing
I'mma let this beat swing, while I think I'm the king
And go rap pon a nice sexy young queen

"I see you move..."
"I see you move..."

[Mad Lion] *singing to the tune "Walk Like an Egyptian"*
Who wan come try, dis-respect
De mother yon chop upon dis head (chop man)
Mother knows every style, oh-wayyy-ohh
Like Shaggy, one called KRS

All the crew
KRS-One, Shaggy, Mad Lion run dat[Intro]
Run, run, run, run...
Will you stay or will you run
When you looking at this

[Chorus]
I know you young but are you looking at this
I know you got dumb but are you looking at this
Your day is gonna come when you looking at this
Will you stay or will you run when you looking at this

[Verse 1]
You cannot see we now free, we get cassette back
So everytime I get the microphone I gotta bless that
Everytime I speak the truth they hopin' you forget that
9/11 truth got proof, you know we rep that
The war was started on a lie - did you forget that?
Politics is all about money and we accept that
Voting is like joking with rights we'll never get back
This a different type of rap of what you might've guessed eh?
Fresh rap - put it on your tongue, man, test that
People always askin' and passin' where KRS at
I be teachin', preachin' and speakin' a little less rap
Educators, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2]
Too many rappers talkin' 'bout now they the best at
While KRS-One is at levels they'll never get at
Beat bitin', fakin' the funk - dudes respect that?
All these lies hitting your head, right where you rest at
They take your mind off the truth and put it where the sex at
Now these rappers doing R&B - forget that
In the game I'm bright, I'm skipped twice, they left that
Cash - I don't stress that, the stage is where I'm fresh at
Cats want cars but don't know where East or West at
Steering themselves right into where the stress at
Their own words got 'em sick and right there where the mess at
Talking like demons but wanting God to bless that
Take a minute, step that
Think a minute, digest that
It's not every day a teacher speaks and you get that
Down goes the devil - ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
The American presidency is for sale and you can check that
You think one man, one vote really elects that
News with views? Where's the free press at
Don't let 'em take your mind and put it where the rest at
Edutainers, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus][Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
Pack up a shot just blow dem brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick bare shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in "Who's The Man"
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a Rasta[Intro]
Run, run, run, run...
Will you stay or will you run
When you looking at this

[Chorus]
I know you young but are you looking at this
I know you got dumb but are you looking at this
Your day is gonna come when you looking at this
Will you stay or will you run when you looking at this

[Verse 1]
You cannot see we now free, we get cassette back
So everytime I get the microphone I gotta bless that
Everytime I speak the truth they hopin' you forget that

Talking like demons but wanting God to bless that
Take a minute, step that
Think a minute, digest that
It's not every day a teacher speaks and you get that
Down goes the devil - ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
The American presidency is for sale and you can check that
You think one man, one vote really elects that
News with views? Where's the free press at
Don't let 'em take your mind and put it where the rest at
Edutainers, straight from the pavement, me nah gon' left that

[Chorus][Hook]
Whatever might go down, we gon' survive that
Food, clothes and shelter, we gon' find that
When you hear this sound, you know that I’m back
Hey, it’s where I put your mind at

[Main Verse]
When that disaster hit, don’t you get trapped in it
You must always stay prepared with your disaster kit
In the club you might be drunk and you may laugh a bit
But when you sober up you know it hits what you have to get
Stay prepared, never be fear for no evil scared
These natural disaster, cannot be compared
So rise and realize you will survive
In the mean time prepare yourself with these supplies
Get coils of rope and coils of wire, in a water proof container
Put all your fire, like matches and candles, and don’t wear sandals
Get some hard boots and work gloves to handle
The situation, cause when disaster hits the nation
You and your family gonn need your medication
Antibiotics, aspirins, don chronic
Even health foods like vitamins and garlic
Pain relievers, inhalers and breathes
And make sure you got something that can take down a fever
A spray bottle of water, with 10% bleach
So you can disinfect the objects you reach
And speaking of bleach, here’s what I teach
Don’t think that you can drink the water from the beach
You gonn have to drink that water from your hood
And purify the water to make sure it’s all good
Put things in order
Put 8 drops of pure unscented liquid bleach
Into the water, use only 8 drops for every 1 gallon you working
You’ll need about 5 gallons a person
With no water, things could get lethal
It’s dehydration, not starvation that kills people
So look for the water first, don’t be robbing and looting and stealing and killing
That will only make things worse
Be smart, plan ahead, save some cash, a radio, some gas
And some blow up beds
Keep your disaster kits high on the shelf
With your weapons, you might have to defend yourself
Get a flash light, chemical light sticks and whole that
A compass, some dry food, maybe a road map
Don’t forget things like peroxide, listerine, bandages and antihistamines like Bendadryl
So when things get ill, you will survive
Cause you really got skill
You opened your eyes
After you got through your list of supplies
Check your attitude, know that you gonna survive

[Hook][Intro]
Aquí no hay frontera. Esta tierra lo que nombraron Los Estados Unidos de tienes la sangre de nuestra raza. Somos una gente ancestral, con un futuro feriante. Que viva Mexico!

[Hook]
How then, can they talk of some border
When they are the invaders?
How then, can they reform immigration
When they invaded their neighbor?

[Verse 1]
America existed before Columbus
Thirty thousand years ago we were here in Mexico
Where's all my Motiacans at? Cock your rifle let it blow
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow all invaders gotta go
This one for my people, my Mexicano people
The whole earth is yours and no human is illegal
Come across the border every woman and man
The US is the alien, Mexico this is your land

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We see the same men living out like cavemen
Coming out the cave and them trying to enslave men
How can we obey them? It's better we betray them
Rise up like the reverend Nat Turner and slay them
Mexican people get your education
Tell your little children that this their nation
You own California, You own Arizona
You own San Diego, and Texas the Lone Star

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Take a look at Mexico, then look at New Mexico
What is a New Mexico if there is a Mexico?
All of America They used to call Amexem
Immigration laws are a fraud and we reject them
We are the Olmec, Toltec, pyramid builder
Astronomer, philosopher, and healer
Mexican people rise up right now
And realize that this is your land now
Sing!

[Hook] x2

Get out![Intro]
You know, you don't see with your eyes
You see with your brain
And the more words your brain has
The more things you can see

[Verse 1]
Yes yes y'all, it don't stop, it can't stop, it won't stop
We used to be there rapping on the block
It was like Hip Hop would never stop
But then we all got older, and a little bit bolder
The streets of New York got a little bit colder
I'm a young dude, I gotta learn and get over
1980, Brooklyn is crazy in the dark
But there I am in Wingate Park
Jamming to the DJs creating this art
I'm on E, but I'm free and I wanna be part
So I gotta be smart and then it just sparked
I'mma start with my heart, achieving the mark
Of being the number one MC on the chart
So on your mark get ready go
I Rock Steadied the show with DJ Scott La Rock, you already know
Yo, these were the days when bands were elected
Based on the jams they selected so check it
This man got respected
When fans detected that the South Bronx
Was the new answer record

[Hook]
And just like that, just like that, just like that
I speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
My dreams they did appear so
Just like that, just like that, just like that
You speak into the air and
Just like that, just like that, just like that
Your dreams they will appear so

[Verse 2]
Just like that I was right on top
Me and Scott La Rock but then Scott La Rock got shot
I can hear him echoing Hip Hop don't stop
But we was getting robbed like a bank with no lock
By a record company that was taking a lot
People blaming us and shaming us, but then it all stopped
When By All Means Necessary dropped
It was like the whole damn Hip Hop culture stopped
But that's when the vultures dropped, from the culture shock
Because we was showing people how they supposed to rock
With their hands in the air and they mouth on scream
But in '81 this was just a dream
But we kept dreaming, kept decreeing, kept seeing
Kept being Hip Hop, breaking, MCing
Graffiti writing, DJing on the weekend
It's the proper use of your mind I'm teaching

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just like that, I began to see
The true force and the power of M-I-N-D
Now I am free and yes I can be
The amazing MC I saw in 81
Back then I was the crazy one
Even the lazy one, the not sure, the maybe one
Now today I'm the sure one, the on tour one
The raw one, the one you want more from
But it was all a dream
Now this brother's on the cover of Word Up magazine
Hanging fliers on my wall
Boogie Down Productions vs MC Shan and Marley Marl
You know my tape rocks, I don't say pop
If I couldn't find OE, then I got the Private Stock
Way back where them Dapper Dan jackets at
With the hat to match, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Just like that, now it's '91
And the West Coast Era now has just begun
And you can't run, crack cocaine affects everyone
Now we know the military, they brought in several tons
Forget them old guns they brought in better ones
The name of this new game is stack your set of ones
For me I remember 1981
When I first wanted to rap it was mainly fun
But Hip Hop was made to run
So them dudes that think it's all about money their day will come
And it comes for many, and it's scary
To learn your whole career was really temporary
But on the contrary we can look at the past
And see the major recording artists that didn't last
But here comes the blast, in order to last
Be the real you, man, take off the mask

[Hook][Intro]

These men are afraid of anything unknown
They'd be afraid of their shadows if they were to touch them!
Word!
Apathy, what's good?
Mad Lion, what's good?
General Steele, what up?
We 'bout to bang on these niggas like Deathrow beats for shit
Word, you niggas scared!
What you gonna do now?
Look and tell, run!
Fuck outta here, nigga
Yo Ap, let's go!

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Ayyo, it's back to the basement, the depths of the batcaves
Trapped in this rat's maze, workin' like a rap slave
Classic as the rap that was crafted in the crack days
Well all I'm seein' is residue and roaches in the ashtrays
East Coast winter's like Satan shut the heat off
I never shut the fuck up till they shut the beat off
A mad scientist, stealin' lightning from the rain
Put the pain into my music just to get it out my brain
Bangin' beats with the samples to leave the streets in shambles
To shake The Bodega shelves and shatter Jesus candles
Blunt guts litter the concrete
My physical shell's weak
You can't sleep, livin' on Elm Street
Retreat to the forest in the fortress like Helm's Deep
I slay the weak when my tape's released like Laserbeak
Try to download me on a Tuesday, Ap drops
It's like your laptop smoked a kilo of crack rock

[Refrain: Mad Lion]
And you should never say never when a boy think he's braver than whoever
You gotta let 'em know
And you should never say never when you know that you cleverer than whoever
You gotta let 'em know

[Verse 2: General Steele]
Yeah
It's like my rap's crafted, mastered in my casket
Cuz only dead rappers got flows this classic
A rose grows from the concrete where she was planted
We all were chose with these roles, that's just how God planned it
This long road that we roam left many men branded
Some managed to handle it, others got stranded
These dreams that I weave leave great beats bandaged, get it?
That's a wrap like saran on a package
Heavyweight shippin' and packin'
Me and Ap on the track
The way we spittin' it's like grippin' a MAC-10
But I don't need no Gatlin', just a pat on the back
>???< The brother of Zeus unleashin' the Kraken
The camp got my back whenever time for action
Stay active, no actin', original gun-clappin'
Boot Camp got my back whenever time for action
Stay active, no actin', original gun...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mad Lion]
To battle me, ya boy need rhyme skills of magic
You're playin' Russian Roulette with a full automatic!
My altar, will alter international
Flop down and now ya down and I snatch a gal
Leave your cyber-rappers, look at what a Facebook crook
Slidin' down a nigga's wall your words won't look
But you still don't get it
I select common edit
Hit delete get it?
Never ever ask me if I've read it
Cryin for respect, ah forget it
Don't come in Myspace I beg it
Rip your whole hood sign before ya .mpeg it
Disrespect, I leave a boy broke-legged
So just follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me down down down!
Follow me, follow me, follow me back to the underground!
Apathy! Don't show a boy no empathy
Simply Don't show no boy no sympathy
We can go and orchestrate just like a symphony
We run the underground, but ya barely get a glimpse of me
Listen me, if I was you I'd convince me
Not to go upside your fuckin' head like an epiphany
Hey listen me, the eagle in my hand is glistening
This is the shit got protectors whistlin
Look what you made me do!
Head rollin' like a Michelin
This a good year and they ass end up listenin'
Baby pictures hangin up on their wall from their christenin
Fans sing their ass goodbyes while their snifflin
Year long dad just end to the shiffilin
Mainstream, broadway, fulton, fans sick of me

[Hook]

Dats why[Intro: Rakaa]
Nah man, sometimes I just vibe out, right?
Get lost, just to find a new way home or something
Nah, sometimes I just like to cruise up top, where I go
Get a good perspective on everything
And I see it all like...

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
I’ve seen the first black, first fam, After M.O.P
I’ve seen Tony Hawk skate the White House, roam free
I’ve seen idealist expectations
And raw racism in the age of misinformation
I’ve seen how delicately the world spins
Political tightrope, slip, the world ends
I’ve seen Barack’s balance, I’ve seen the flocks worship him
But when they get practical, it slowly starts to hurt again
They ask me if I support, I say that I’m a reporter
I’m under no illusion, yes I know they’re under orders
I’ve seen a politician’s hate to feed a thin veil
A few stretch their arm out straight and inhale
The water is all set for Tea Party service, boiling
The government makes free markets nervous
Historic bills, Biden called a “Big Fucking Deal”
Healthcare, but schools are sick, kids suffer still

[Hook: Mad Lion]
With the alignment of the stars, I even seen the fall
From my observatory, I focus and I see it all
(Alignment of the stars, I even see it fall
From my observatory I focus and see it all.)

[Verse 2: Rakaa]
I’ve seen nature show the Golden Ratio, in the ocean
DNA plants galaxies in heavenly motion
To the base of creation, the prime
To the life lived in between modern measured units of time
I’ve seen my line go back to Nine Ether Divine
Heirloom genetics helped, when that pure light shines
The Sekam, the Naiyama, The Chiqui, the Pirhana
Solar Cycle put the extra energy on ‘em
Mitochondria DNA from the Nile
To Henrietta Lacks, ride full circle back to black
The original dynasty to reunite you lambs
Five rulers from Nubia, Kushites advance
Restore order, my diaspora is in everything
Common denominator links bloodlines in every king
I’ve seen Egypt get effects, make-up and editing
For the screen, the Hollywood propaganda machine

[Hook: Mad Lion]

[Verse 3: Rakaa]
I’ve seen Blackwater become XE
They sold parties for the GOP, RNC
Hellraisers connect, VIP Fundraisers for checks
I’ve seen my face on a traitor card deck
I’ve seen few things in my life as irresponsible as that
I broke down the big business of war, it’s a fact
Retail artillery, civilians will be shelled
Collateral, the media flips the details
I’ve seen Halliburton spin-off to KBR
Control power, plus modern slavery for a charge
Oil money so slick, Dick Cheney retired
CEO, the Texas company moved to Dubai
The World Bank is the church, I see worshippers of currency
Then I’ve seen millions turn to billions in emergency
Arms dealing, war profiteering, racketeering by the same ones
Malcom would have called out the hearings

[Hook: Mad Lion]

[Outro: Mad Lion]
Mad Lion, you see me!
Open your third eye vision, don’t listen to the “Tell-Lie-Vision”
Ya see me, them the soldiers in Gideon
Stay focused, we it ain't hopeless, you know this
Ya see me, Dilated Peoples* H.W.C. harmonizes a melody (no words) where this appears

So gather round now for the raptism
Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
The cat'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Time for spiritual activism, life is a journey
And Kris got the map with him
Teach latinos and blacks with 'em
It's amazing when whites and asians kick raps with 'em
Cause out of a thousand MC's, believe I taught half of 'em
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I beam through many images
My origin is a mystery like capstones on pyramids
We live it kid, challenge the teacher you will regret that
I'm giving careers and taking careers away, did you forget that?
* Better check that, you can rock this track and the next track
* But when I correct the spirit hit, you'll always be set back
So gather round now for the raptism
Only those that got hip-hop in 'em
And not rap in 'em and no crack with 'em
Step up now and receive a holy dose
From a holy host, and take a break from these rappers that only boast
*
{HWC} Wake up, to make up
[KRS] Yeah yeah, yeah
{HWC} Wake up, to make up
[KRS] Huh, huh, yeah yeah, yeah
{HWC} Wake up, to make up
[KRS] Yo, yeah, yo..
* My intellectual battle will make your brains rattle
* I'll unwrap you and your crew from the same shackle
I'm on many different planes like a airport
Psychologically you be rethinkin your identity and cuttin ya hair short
Now there's a thought, that exposes your insecurity
You put no fear in me, I break the M from the C
* And reverse it to say "See 'em? See 'em?"
* They allow the devil to lead 'em, and they be givin up they freedom
So, huh, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
When the spirit hear it the lyric long before the track get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
I spit 'em out, gotta get 'em out, the world I never been about
I see them glitter but their spirit's goin in and out
We see them fading, we also see them hating
We also see those living for musical chart ratings
Hear what I'm stating or trading for what you're paying
Replace fear with faith and you'll stop decaying
Gather round for the raptism (word)
Gather round for the raptism (word, word)
{HWC} Wake up, wake up, wake up
* Gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Make up, make up, make up
* Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
* the cat'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Yo, yo, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
Word.. word..
{HWC} Wake up
Word..
{HWC} Wake up
The dogs don't get 'em
The cat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
{HWC} Everyday, when you wake up
{HWC} You got a chance, to MAKE UP!
Remember, you are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
{HWC} Wake up to make up
{HWC} Wake up to make up
Twice a year, hip-hoppers come together
To celebrate the unity of hip-hop
We come together, during Hip-Hop Appreciation Week
{HWC} Wake up to make up..
Which is every third week in May
{HWC} Wake up to make up..
Then, we come together in Novemeber
To celebrate Hip-Hop History Month
I will see you there - PEACE![Hook] x2
So if you think you're too old
Your thinking that you're too cold
You gave up on your true goals
The system gotcha
I'm giving you a new soul
You're never ever too old
To manifest your true goals
Or the system gotcha

[Verse 1]
You're never too old to sell a key
So how could you be too old to emcee?
I'm from where it originated so get me
Why would I stop what I created, even at sixty?
Shout out to Herc and Cindy
Hip hop lifts me and never left me
You know where KRS be
Right there where the best be
When I spit a free I can't help it if that's how God blessed me
So I'm never empty, writer's block never tempts me
With twenty albums I mastered this evidently
So I ask you gently
You don't see how to spot me on the block with my classic medley?
I can't stop, people won't let me
I don't talk sexy, but I do come correctly and you can check me
But just don't compare me to the next G
KRS-ONE: when you get older you'll respect me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I keep it moving all over the country
Doing underground spots with the ceiling above me
I keep it dark and ugly, microphone crusty
We will be here forever; trust me
I rock the spots that be dusty and banged out
I do house parties, raves and gang hangouts
Others took the same route, we didn't take the main route
You know who they are, I ain't gotta call they name out
They superstars, but in 1986 you ain't know who we are
And notice when I said "who we are", as opposed to "who we were"
Cause the past and future already occurred, but it was blurred
Time reversal symmetry just occurred
My being is timeless if the future remembers me
And there's no end to me, word!
Past and future happen at the same time, especially in the memory
We share the same mind. Images of my future telling me the same sign
In 1983 who I'd be in '09, but it's past 2011 and I flow fine
Rapping at 70? Believe that it's no crime
These youngins rent they style, I own mine
As you can see, I don't be relying on my old rhymes
I'm spitting raw rhymes, right here, right now
25 years, I never put the mic down[Intro]
"One two, testing one two
Alright party people in the place to be
The party has already started
An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*"

[Verse 1]
Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
Where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom, chill
As I rock em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, still, number one I hype it
Your album, rewrite it

[Hook]
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC

[Verse 2]
Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
Will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak! My grammar
With stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
And crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
While poetically recriminate you like a child I will
Get ill, and switch to earn
Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
Be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter
Fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
*cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
"Yo Kris you hit too hard" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is "Who let the K out?"
No grey area
Everything is black and white we took the gray out its scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
Is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
Your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me? No no no no no no NO!

[Hook]

[Mad Lion: Outro]
If a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!
BDP crew get up in that ass like a piece of toilet tissue
General Lion I chase them all and I am on fiyah
Represent the hardest crew, you know how we do
Anything tess, dead! Gun shot to dem head
Gwan *echoes*[Intro: KRS-One]
Who is the DJ that's cutting it up?
Bring it back yo, bring it back
Mad Lion, KRS-One. Set, set it!

[Verse One: Mad Lion]
Act like ya know and don't act like a slob
Or else you're gonna give my gun a blow job
[?] fool and crazy
Your little Illegal style can't phase me
[?] breathing indo
Mad Lion mad and I kill people too
Whether with mic or a gun
[?] there's no place to run
No place to duck and no place turn
[?]

[KRS-One]
Lyric for lyric, KRS with god mad enthusiasm excite
The protoplasm to the orgasm
Or neck spasm
This ain't no phantasm
Title I smash 'em, your favorite rapper you can't match him
Against this
Mad Lion and Kris
Ten years ago we passed but they persist, so we ask 'em
"Who don't you think about when you think about
Taking an MC out?
It's the Teacher no doubt
Oratorically supreme
I don't go up in the mainstream, I go up in your bloodstream
Like the dope fiend
Me? You could never double team
That's the impossible dream
I don't lack self esteem I gleam
Still it seems
As I read Vibe magazine
Rappers day dream about letting off steam
You know what I mean when I roll up on the scene
And go to the extreme
On your peaches and cream team
Keep your conversations to a minimal
Mind it, I'm still Criminal Minded
If you listen you'll find it
Any time you wanna commit professional suicide
Find my tour guide
Collide where I reside
And you'll be hog tied
Crucified and drip dried
I'm amplified like the five o'clock free ride
You've been notified, we can take this outside
Statewide, along the country side I'll leave you cross eyed

[Mad Lion]
Give thanks and praise while big spliff blaze
Watch out

Keep in mind who started this flow
Mad Lion, yo you better act like you want it
Lyrics we flaunt it and float it, we own it
You copy, we wrote it
See
Clickity, click click
In goes the magazine
[?] against your spleen
Cause we don't sta-stutter
We don't sta-stammer
Gunshot [?] and now you skin like a Hummer
My grammar
Is great
Whoever underrate
I keep it nice and spiffy for all you pirates
Who rape, this style I create?
Mistake
I'm real, you're fake

[KRS-One]
Yeeeeah
They were talking loud, now they mumble
The ball they fumble
My lyrics bump like razor stubble, double trouble
The Remix, I gat ya, the Funk is the Master
As I Flex on the next rapper when I'm vexed
Checks are cashed
As ass is grass fast
In a flash, long last the flavor from the Blastmaster major
Captain
Inner city general rapper
And we kept it real
No sugar, no saccharin
While other reggae artists chase the platinum, we don't fear 'em
Yesterday they were large, today you don't hear 'em
Like clothes we wear them out
Paper we tear them no doubt
Mad Lion come and take 'em out

[Mad Lion]
Double trouble
That's what you get when my blood pressure bubble
Piss in the grate, your body turn into rubble
Never want gold
You never were humble
Now it's time pitty bad bwoy them rumble
[?] a football fumble
No you wanna walk through the lion's jungle
Bring all your crew
Bust slugs and rumble
That's why the lion him say

[Outro: KRS-One]

You don't realize the magnitude I laugh at you
Flappin you rat-a-tat, you on your own avenue
While I'm slappin you, askin you, "Why you actin new?"
Crushin a mack and you turnin up the black in you
Skill for skill you the minor we the major

ZERO, don't be a fan! Like DeNiro
Be a teacher, be a role model, be a hero
Get it clear yo, I be rollin with de po-sse
Now do your plan over or get, ran over

[Mad Lion]
I be crusin down the highway, just sportin in the fly way
Turn it up a notch and de sound hits dem
Creepin through traffic with the sunroof open
To ventilate the scent from the spliff we smokin
Huff with a chop we do not
We make up a mighty powder, said scrap, last week!
We close in the Jeep, no fire for sleep
Dem come rough and make you one of dem weak or
In de dance kill a watch like chicken in my pot
Call dem with de champagne, can't stop that's right!
Man of been to dem place, to champagne away
Sign of money, can virus strike

"I see you move..."
Look now man, look look
"I see you move..."
I think it's time for it

[Shaggy]
Who dat from the chat with the boom shot
Hit you with the lyrical bash, so won't last
Rudebwoy check your stash, caught the cash
And if you don't like dat, somebody gettin bitch-slapped
I'm the raggamuffin with the Dream Team
KRS, Mad Lion guaranteed to make your money scream
(See? All you need) rhythmatical style
(Need) ya done gwan irie, peep
Pump ya best if ya irie, like me
Cause we don't want know si-ren, hey
Nuff a rhyme works, nobody gets hurt
Look up on the dancefloor, herd of nothin but skirts
Fellas in the club, actin like vi-pers
Bitin them girls like your name was Marv Albert
Baby love no fighting, come to back biting
You and your girlfriend should do the right thing
I'mma let this beat swing, while I think I'm the king
And go rap pon a nice sexy young queen

"I see you move..."
"I see you move..."

Oh someone go on like them ya born to find if I bought them
Born for prime star

So you call them frienemy, understand me
We don't have no time for playin' so you know what
Yeah, scream out
Come lay down Salt and Pepa is a team
Mad Lion representin' VP, you know how we do
You 'bout to say to yourself, what what
Say one, then some
The paper, can't understand, uh
One degree says, she can't understand
Oh some friend come, wait, you been scammed
The thing that everone thought
Bought the Mr. Lover some

Sandra "Pepa" Denton:

Queen, honey bee wannabes
They want to be in front of me
But it ain't no run in me
That's word to my son and me
Now you wanna be family cuz you see the Grammies (Yeah)
Playin' me close, ask me where's my man, how's my man
Sandy be damned be, I keeps the cheese handy
Got the trap for you rats come strapped with the gammy
Jealousy be swellin' me, word
So I had to charge 'em at will
And leave a bill, like Bellamy
What are you tellin' me
Don't let me catch a felony
People trip out, bring out the hell in me
But I stay paid in full, faithful, and always grateful
Stay on guard, praise God, pity the hateful

Mad Lion:

Said why you gotta be like that, uh
We make your money, bought you watch and my stacks, uh
I know you wanna play the games we play
Only man, finds his car fade away, hey
Why you gotta be like that, uh
Only one-ninety people stepped back, uh

Sandra "Pepa" Denton:

Friends to the end for the ends did ya favors
Damn, why you wanna stick me for my papers

Cheryl "Salt" James:

Would have gave you the world now you can't catch a crumb
How you bum-bum-bitty come so dumb-dumb
Remember when you was all busted, broke down, beat up
Even kept you as a friend when you stole to stay steed-up
Wanna be down with my business, we meet up
Schemin' like a demon on the couch with your feet up
Playin' like a summer may stain by far
Got mad I had the juice so you tried to take the jar
I feel for you, yes, I do
No fame, no crew, now what you gon' do, Boo
He say, she say, we say, why say
The fly-ways my way
The try fray, hit the highway

Mad Lion:

Say one, then some
The paper, can't understand, uh
One degree says, she can't understand
Oh some friend come, wait, you been scammed
The thing that everone thought
Bought the Mr. Lover some
Said why you gotta be like that, uh
We make your money, bought you watch and my stacks, uh
I know you wanna play the games we play
Only man, finds his car fade away, hey

Queen Latifah:

You smile in my face but all the while you wanna take my place
Put it on a paper chase and you can't keep my pace
You're jealous cuz I'm this shit and you ain't
Far as I'm concerned, I don't know you from a can of paint (Hey yo, who you)
No time to worry about who likes me, who didn't invite me
Behind my back callin' me shysty, that don't excite me
Backstabbers keepin' that he said, she said runnin'
Always in my business, I leave when I see you comin' (Yo, I'm out)
See you got the game twisted, I could care less
My house is bought and paid for, your rent's due, you're stressed
Nevertheless, you wanna keep some drama on blast
But I don't worry cuz I'm quick to come and check that ass

Mad Lion:

They're spine behind your face
But meantime, they wanna take your place
Those back-stabbers, hey, back-stabbers

Sandra "Pepa" Denton & Cheryl "Salt" James:

Check it, everybody sees you as preemy and teeny
You see me in 3-D, and need me like a genie
All your wishes are washed up like lock up
We need to write a book called Shit That Botched Up
One thing that Sandi can't understand
The all the world jet but see a plentiful of hands
So tell me, how can we shake 'em, firmly you break 'em
Get 'em hot, and bake 'em, run to miss 'em, I may say
Chase me cuz I don't chase them, chill, in fact
Like friends we are family with a bill attatched
Pep's that green-eyed monster, make them ill and that
Well if envy ever tempt me, Salt steer me back

Mad Lion:

Said why you gotta be like that, uh
We make your money, bought you watch and my stacks, uh
I know you wanna play the games we play
Only man, finds his car fade away, hey
Never never, never should you get paper
Think you better, better, get up, get up this place
Some new, shit, on my tounge and lip
Only one time, then, I will be done with it, go
Some will get with it, some will get wrecked with it
Some will host and they claim, that they say, we did
You faced it and if you why, sack and I messed with
His name was ah-uh-huh-uh-huh, forget this shit
Mad Lion is sick
No bed could get up in this re-lyrical
Full of new time threat, hey
I got my rhymes and the national anthem
Got more rhymes than either Oleen or Tonet
Got more rhymes than they made us sweat
Of a nigga, of a crooked waitin' for the damn check, uh
But let's not forget the, back-biters is the name of this set, uh
All the people, and we know you bite mine
Soldier people shall shine
Yo' come in the next track, up thisWhere shall we land, there?
Which city shall we destroy today?
This one, or that one?  This one?

[KRS-One]
Take a look a look around, we last forever
We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin, we wise and we chillin
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses
NONE passes, without studyin this flow
It's all good as long as you know Kris know!

[Chorus: Mad Lion]
While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

[KRS-One]
I stand with the rejected, the unsuspected, the unconnected
The neglected the one you, never suspected
It seems you forget hip-hop plays the back
Sayin that's my sound, and that's my sound
And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin it back
I'm actually, I'm everywhere at every time
Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind
KRS is my representative on Earth
Challenge him not, he's been hip-hop since birth
His main objective, is to put hip-hop in perspective
Show pity, and DESTROY these wack cities

[Chorus]

[Mad Lion]
Inna style dem a {?}, yo alla dem a cry
Dey worship slackness and to be under sky
We lead dem to de water but we cyan't make dem drink
Pussy to take a sip, cause it gon' make you t'ink
We don't usually {?} shit {?}, yo alla dem a sing
Wisdom wort more den any diamond and gold
People use it and find it like de Dead Sea Scrolls

[KRS] Take dem Lion, take 'em, take it over!

[Mad Lion]
Cause of dem outer, dem outer, dem outer inter outer inter
Outer inter outer inter out of control
Dey neva find wisdom til dem dead ohhh
Mad Lion make de {?} roll
KRS make up a sea and bulge ya
Of the story of never been told-a
Cause we outer, outer, inter outer outer ese
Out of control, out of control
I'm so serious ay (what?)
We don have no time fi play, ay (tell 'em again)
Some people diss dem {?} hell's in this world
But dey'll come around one day

[KRS-One]
Yo, yo, only Beezlebub think my voice is aggravatin
Children of light hear my voice and start congregatin
The mind's debatin, is he a prophet or is he Satan?
But the tree is only known by it's fruit, what am I creating?
What am I stating?  Have I stood the test of time?
Or am I fading, or has God blessed my rhyme?
Settle your dissin, you better be listenin, forever we glisten
The metaphysician with a better way, makin a better day daily[Verse One: E Devious]
Straight up out the backyard of Hell, I'm coming through
Leaving floods of blood, no clue but the residue
Ain't nothing new I keeps One In The Chamber
(Why?)
They said the R was a Clear And Present Danger
Non stop (pop pop)
They wanna stop (hold up)
You tried to roll up
And got your fat mouth stole up
Another chapter in the math that's after
When provoked, we gon' do what we have to
E the arsonist with the gas and a lighter
It won't be long before I burn me a writer
I stalking in the dark with the (flash, waiting for Satan
So we can start the reincarnating)
The mack devil
Be the soul that'll deviant
Mad mischievous, you best believe me it's
Only one way out, surrounded by fire
And barb wire
And straits that's dire
Cursed with a brain Fahrenheit 212 degrees
I can't chill, my mind's too hot to freeze

[Hook: E Devious]
You never know when the shell got your name on it
Who's getting fame on it, who got the claim on it
The ambush is gonna shoot ya down
And we ain't scared to handle beef on neutral ground

[E Devious]
Word
You ain't falling
You already fell down
Suit up kid, for what you're did you're going hellbound

[Hook]
You never know when the shell's got your name on it
Who's getting fame on it, who got the claim on it
The ambush is gonna shoot ya down
And we ain't scared to handle beef on neutral ground
You won't know when the scope got your head on it
Hollow point lead on it with the infrared on it
The R.S.O.'s spreading [?] around
Bodies are found cause we be living hellbound

[Verse Two: Tony Rhome]
Still fed up
I'm going head up with my conscious
I'm finding myself in the situation too often
Pockets are low and I know one way to fill them again
Drug dealing again
Hook up with Smiles and start illing again
It's fair to say I got this feeling again
So I'ma set up shop when I wake up I be breaking up rock in 'em
Reading to make a killing in front of this girl's crib
As I flip from one o.z. to two o.z. for the same price
I'm getting 63, it's no mystery
Things don't really change from the things I used to see
Ain't trying to be no big time hustler
Plus the, cops got many snitches, leary suckers turn to busters
So how long will it last or past
Sure mean nothing last forever
However
The Rhome is much more clever
So whenever it goes down I won't sweat it cause I found
I'm hellbound

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Benzino]
Yo give me the strap so I can let this little punk know
He's gonna die cause he tried to fuck the R.S.O
I'm getting fed up with these suckers always fronting like they're real
Showing off in front of their boys because they got a record deal
So what you gonna say with a mouth full of Glock?
The Most Beautifulest Thing is your ass in a wooden box
I guess you just don't understand what we're going through
Or what we've been through
So now we getting you

[Mad Lion]

[Benzino]
Ayo Big Hurse I need a blintz so I can ease up all the stress
I hope my brain busts
The Jackel is kicking up much dust
I'm representing L.O.D. and everywhere I'm hellbound
Kid I'll see you when I get there

[Mad Lion]
