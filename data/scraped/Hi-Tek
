[Intro]
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape
WOO!!!

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1]
First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Hook]"What'd you do last night?"
"We did umm, two whole cars
It was me, Dez, and Main Three right?
And on the first car in small letters it said
'All you see is..' and then you know
Big, big, you know some block silver letters
That said '..crime in the city' right?"
"It just took up the whole car?"
"Yeah yeah, it was a whole car and shit..."

Escuchela.. la ciudad respirando

[Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options,no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

[Hook]
So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

[Talib Kweli]
Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure, cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets, swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state

[Hook]

[Spanish speaking woman] Escuchela.. respirando ??

[Common]
Yo...on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war It's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

[Hook: Mos Def and Crew][Intro: Mos Def]
Looooord... Lord have mercy
All nice and decent crew, follow me now, we say
Say Hi-Tek, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Say J. Rawls, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Redefinition say you're ruling hip-hop
Say Black Star come to rock it non

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, forecast and aftermath of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gathering
Connecting like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
Cause all my Brooklyn residents, known as heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn? (Whoa)
See that? Bound to take it all kid, believe that
From where they sell they tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli, e-Kweli-ty, yo, tell 'em where we be at

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Brooklyn, New York City, where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust, cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity – blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinking MC is short hand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walking the streets is like battling, be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third grade teacher reading and talking about
"I knew he'd amount to nothing"
Neighbors like, "He was the quiet type
Who'd have thought they was fronting?"
Talking loud like you on RCA
Get carted away with body parts and trays
What a way to start your day, yo it's like

[Hook]
One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one, two, three
It's kind of dangerous to be an MC
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I said Manhattan keep on making it, Brooklyn keep on taking it
So relax we're taking it back, Red Hook where we're living at
Plenty cats be struggling not hustling and bubbling
It ain't about production and – what else we discussing?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True original b-boy apostle
Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
You think you the shit
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spitting the epitome of stupidity
Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Still sipping wishing well water, imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher, will complete us as we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up

[Hook][Hook - Mos Def]
One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, wayohh
I said, one two three, Black Star shine eternally
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
And Hi-Tek make the beat drop, wayohh

[Talib Kweli]
RE:DEFinition, turning your play into a tragedy
Exhibit level degree on the mic, passionately
Niggas is sweet so I bet if I bit I'd get a cavity
Living to get high, you ain't flyer than gravity
We die hard like the battery thrown in the back of me by the mad MC
Who think imitation is the highest form of flattery, actually
Don't be mad at me, I had to be the one to break it to you
You get kicked into obscurity like judo -- no, Menudo
Cause You pseudo, trying to compete with reality like Xerox
Towards destruction you spiraling like hairlocks, wipe them teardrops
Chasing stars in your eyes, playing games with your lives
Now the wives is widows soaking up pillows, weeping like willows
Still more blacks is dying, cause they live and they trying
"How to Make a Slave" by Willie Lynch is still applying
Regardless, the Mos is one of my closest partners
Rocking ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rocking before Funkmaster Flex was rocking Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool, before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosing with every breath I'm enhancing
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

[Mos Def]
What, lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claiming they hard be mad fags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinking they ship, like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son I'm way past the minimum, entering millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinia, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter wind, day after December 10
These simpletons they mentioned in the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen) you got a tenement, well then assemble it!
Leave your unit trembling like herds of moving elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddling, making em WOOP
Like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot Apache red who burn down your chief teepee
You see me?

[Hook]
One two three, Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, wayohh
I said, one two tree, Black Star shine eternally
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Because we ruling hip-hop, yes we is rulin hip-hop
Talib Kweli is ruling hip-hop
Say we Black Star, we rule hip-hop-ah-ahh-ah-ahh-ahh
Whoahhhh![Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
From the intro you know I'm so influential cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential dog, what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you, they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police, want that info, they'll grill 'em like Portobellos
I'm murdering instrumentals cause I rap with the conscience
To villains, killers and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still fulfilling the promise, so nice I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali, you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma, you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty, or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope, my people still a target

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
I'm in New York now, like Akeem and Semmi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious BUM, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan Hakeem Olajuwon Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the courtroom, screaming 'Who Dat?' on the devil
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And shorty, you straight, bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol, bet I'm about to ball
And never let up, look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention, this is clever, I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers, I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign, boy you know I'mma shine
Flow is in Ramadan, cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick, man I should throw a condom on
Ay, cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas, I just lock and load squeeze
Dog I'm on a higher level, I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his Glock but won't squeeze
Please

[Verse 4: Mos Def]
Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble pla-anted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master djinn, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem, and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him, there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

[Outro: Mos Def]
You're welcome, thanks
Appreciation for your participation
Special dedication
Celebration, bitches[Produced By Hi-Tek]

[Verse 1:The Game]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I watched my Uncle Greg put D's on a '6-4
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Chopped crack and watched "Colors" so I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette
Til' one weekend my Uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend, my Pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block, they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'
Kill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older, I would understand that
It's blood in, blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13, that's when I had my first (Olde English)

[Hook]

[Verse 2:The Game]
I was the first nigga with a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and make the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brothers Glock
And that's the day my life changed cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that "Chronic" from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my a-di-das
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left finger prints on my (Olde English)

[Hook]

[Verse 3:The Game]
I got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip
This is life, stop watchin' that "Boyz N The Hood" shit
You see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans
I went to 20 funerals by the age of 19
Then I went to college, basketball was my dream
Quit the team, cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit, and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in (Old English)

[Hook][Talib Kweli]
So many emcees focusin on black people extermination
We keep it balanced with that knowledge of self, determination
It's hot, we be blowin the spots, with conversations
C'mon let's smooth it out like Soul Sensation

We in the house like Japanese in Japan, or Koreans in Korea
Head to Philly and free Mumia with the Kujichagulia TRUE
Singin is swingin and writin is fightin, but what
They writin got us clashin like titans it's not excitin
No question, bein a black man is demandin
The fire's in my eyes and the flames need fannin (3X)

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination
*repeat 4X*

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
Things I say and do, may not come quite through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

[Talib Kweli]
Yes yes come on, yes yes
Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
With that you never worry about your last breath
Death comes, that's how I'm livin, it's the next days
The flesh goes underground, the book of life, flip the page
Yo they askin me how old, we livin the same age
I feel the rage of a million niggas locked inside a cage
At exactly which point do you start to realize
That life without knowledge is, death in disguise?
That's why, Knowledge Of Self is like life after death
Apply it, to your life, let destiny manifest
Different day, same confusion, we're gonna take this
Hip-hop shit and keep it movin, shed a little light
Now y'all bloomin like a flower with the power of the evident
Voices and drums original instruments
In the flesh presently presentin my representation

With that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

My words may not convey just what I'm feelin

[Talib Kweli]
The most important time in history is, NOW, the present
So count your blessings cause time can't define the essence
But you stressin over time and you follow the Roman calendar
These people into cloning like Gattaca, you can bet
They tryin to lock you down like Attica, the African diaspora
Represents strength in numbers, a giant can't slumber forever
I know you gotta get that cheddar whatever
Aiyyo I heard you twice the first time money, get it together
You must be History, you repeatin yourself out of the pages
You keepin yourself depleatin your spiritual wealth
That quick cash'll get your ass quick fast in houses of detention
Inner-city concentration camps where no one pays attention
Or mentions the ascension of death, til nothing's left
The young, gifted and Black are sprung addicted to crack
All my people where y'all at cause, y'all ain't here
And your hero's using your mind as a canvas to paint fear
With, broad brush strokes and tales of incarceration
You get out of jail with that Knowledge of Self determination
Stand in ovation, cause you put the Hue in Human
Cause and effect, effect everything you do
And that's why I got love in the face of hate
Hands steady so the lines in the mental illustration is straight
The thought you had don't even contemplate
Infinite like figure eight there's no escape..

From that what? (Knowledge Of Self) Determination

I'm a motherfuckin Aftermath nightmare, wake up motherfucker
I traded in my black Nike Airs
For a white pair of Converse, Dre let me bomb first
Get out on bail and still make the concert
Ask Eminem, homey I'm Shady
Too much West coast dick lick it, remember Jay-Z?
"The Chronic" and "Doggystyle" raised me
My life like rock, it was based in the 80's
Red bandana tied around my face
I hope the shit don't jam is how gangsters pray
And if God forgives the nigga that shot Suge
Then all dawgs should go to heaven in my hood
I resurrected this gangster shit
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get?
Every city got Crips and Bloods
But since 'Pac died it ain't been no "California Love"

"Still getting mine, in the 1 9 9 9"

[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was moving too fast, you known I'm saying?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

[Common]
Check it
It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts, stalk rhythms, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MCs reckless eyeball, why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...

[Scratched Hook]

[Sadat X]
You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm telling you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
Cause I'm the dead eye, with the red eye, from Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed, praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me
The king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...

[Scratched Hook]

[Common]
Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
Searching for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style "Nitti"
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Built with her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck, yo I'm still getting mine

[Scratched Hook][Intro]
Yeah Hi-Tek
For who do we aspire to reflect our own people's death
For who's entertainment shall we sing of agony? In what hopes?
That the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us will suddenly
Suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success?
The last imbecile to dream that dream is dead
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream
Armah, 2000 seasons

[Verse 1]
I'm not a human being getting on some spiritual shit
A spiritual being manifested as a human that's it
When I spit I spray thoughts that's representing my life
Yo I step into the spot leave niggas open like mics
Take on em on a tour
Explore psychologies of war
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen em before
Shorties come back raw
Straight out the c- 74
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by laws
The world is run by men who use laws for tools
But I come thru war tactics like Shaka Zulu
Mcs is soft like play-doh
I shape 'em
Smash em to pieces
Volunteer
Slaves crave the words I'm painting
The masterpieces
You hear em on the radio babbling
The truth is traveling with the word
I sent flying through the air like a javelin
Unraveling like a verdict
Pound it in your chest like a gavel in the highest court
In Bablyon, let's travel on
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live
Then from the get your ass was foul
And foul just is how you is
No excuses see, life's dilemnas are set up like a mirror
Just to show you all your faces
Now your understanding is clearer
You had your chance for evolution
You let it pass you by
That's why
I'm dissing wack mc's till the day that I die
Reflection getting you high
We stand our ground with the believers
The leaning tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza
No comparison
The way I flip it is embarassing
Tis the season
Ain't no caroling

[Verse 2]
All knowing
Flowing like spring water in the desert
Balling through the barren land
Where niggas take a stand, like castles made of sand
Free falling
For anything
Nothing but a plan to fail for they selves
No sense of delf, needed daily affirmations of self help
Yo it's right in front of yo grill stop looking everywhere else
Speaking of planning
Hustling and scheming
Looking for hookups
Took up too much time
Like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up
God bless the child that got his own shit
I got my team's
So the fiends now become opponents
They the opposition
Stronger from competition
Shining like a golden shower, your face I'm pissing in
Completing a genocide mission like
The Warren commission
Like fathers was supposed to be missing
While our sisters were supposed to be whoring
Save it for a rainy day, money is pouring
Under grey clouds, black butterflys still be soaring
Flying in frienldy skies
We classifying the highs
Blood be flowing in the streets like crimson tide in my eyes
The thai be having me drowsy
But I get mellow with the chronic
Intellectuals embarrased cause we discussing ebonics
I'm on a roll like sonic
In an age that the plague got bubonic proportions
Yo I call it reparations, but they call it extortion
Whatever
Just give me mine
But caution
You've been warned for the very last time
I'm not telling you again
So relay it to your crew
You gotta actually to do
Forget the drive in, driveby and drive through
You've got to
Get out the car
Humble yourself
Tilt your head back, and look at the stars
Shining over someplace very far, from where you standing
When the night is clear
You understanding just who put them there
What you know about the space you get lost in
Your peoples can't hear you in the distortion
The desert is absorption
And you sucked and you stuck off american freezing for like
2000 seasons
Upon your return from raping and crossbreeding
Your own people accuse you of deceiving and misleading
Causing mass confusion. Drug abusing
Now you all caught up in institutions
At this time you've got to break it down and be showing and proving
An A&R told me that I use too many catch phrases
True I'm trying to catch all my people in all different stages all
Different phases

It's like that y'all...(talking)
If you can talk you can sing
If you can walk you can dance
That's an old proverb from Zimbabwe
You know what I mean
If you can talk you can sing
If you can walk you can dance
Yeah, and the trumpet is blown
Yeah, alright, C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Alright, Wooh!

(talking)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, one more time
Yo, anybody can tell you how it is
What we putting down right here is how it is and how it could be
Reflection Eternal for real
And with that-

These cats is no match, plus they lack a certain knack for rapping
They never catch the wagon like Re-run and "What's Happening"
Since back when they had potty issues and snotty tissues we been rockin
Think you poppin next year nobody will miss you
My thoughts is too advanced for the artists on these labels
They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time like Sankofa, Sankofa

We stand over the Atlantic, looking broad like a man's shoulders
The fire is trapped in a belly, ready to pop like canned soda
We outlasting, from middle passage
Touched down in New York
Cincinnatay! Big Ohio status what you thought
Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant
Yo, got to tell you to your face
You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name
These cats drink champagne and toast to death and pain
Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain

(talking)
Yo, we the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much (7x)

Yo, we the reflection of our ancestors
We'd like to thank you for the building blocks you left us
Cause your spirit possessed us
Yo, you blessed us
Thank you very much
God bless you (7x)[Intro]

[Girl] Well look, wee need to talk
[Mega] Ahh boy
Yo listen, check this out

[Corega]
Last night I had a dream, it had me opened like a fiend
I remember its me you, the moon and ocean breeze
My heartbeat increased, like I seen approachin' D's
I relax cause of these words you spoke to me
You said "You wanna feel me"
Inside you, conceal me
I belong to you, no other woman can steal me
You mentally attached, essentially in fact
What you give is so real, you know I had to give it back
How I feel don't even matter, if I ain't expressing
Affection, my mind was infected you healed me
We destined, your beauty so addictive
I can't deny your presence
So pure, I got to add cut to stretch it
Your all I need in this world to succeed
I won't let you go cause I can see you trust me
I never, leave or deceive you
And if its understood, then we can be together
Cause you treat a nigga good

[Jonell]
All I need is you
- In my life, to be down with me
All I need is you
- To hold me, and to make me see
All I need is you
- To be there in my time of need
All I need is you
- I'll be there when you need me to be

[Cormega]
When I was running he streets, I know you wanted to leave
Especially the time, you found a nine in my jeans
But you persevere, gave work and tears
That's why I'll never desert you or hurt you, yeah
I used to keep feelings concealed, now I reveal em'
I was hustling to get right, now we chillin
All my mans staring at the ceiling, thinking of children
And any other situation, we might deal with
At first I was hesitating, making a commitment
Now I see you different, so many ways
I need a Queen like a King, did he pray Egyptians days?
And it seems you been afraid, I might get into things
That might put me away for years, save your fears
Listen ma, lets get one thing clear
I never leave you, deceive you, and if its understood
We could be together, cause you treat a nigga good

[Hook]

[Cormega]
Yo, I'm not the type to have a next chick calling your phone
Come see you at night, and then the morning you alone
I keep it a real with you, like my connects you got it good
I need to deal with you, I've yet to leave the hood
But I'm still with you, every time you need me, I'm there for you
If I didn't care for you, why would I be here for you?
Your peer loyal, got the kids spoiled
On the low, I don't think I would prepare for you
You cook good, look good, boo I adore you
And if you get me mad, we won't fight, I'll ignore you (yeah right)
Just playing, but yo, I'm just saying
I'm about to go, cause Hi-Tek waiting
Yo son, that beat ready?

{*phone hangs up*}[Verse 1]
Holy goof, who gon' do it if it's not me?
Oh it's only you, whoopdie do who gon' stop me?
Linking up with Tek in Cincinnati
Steady rocking rhymes while you talk Illuminati
Child please, steaming hot steady making broccoli
Sugar snap peas, better piece what I'm sprouting
Bounce b like we going out with no house keys
Leave 'em like wow, so wow, don't know how he
(?) be proud freaking speak loudly
Can't figure out, go try to seek therapy
Hourly, rate is like 15 for fakes
Got 16s for real, a big screen in space
And Brooke Shields so real I can almost lick her face
A slicker Navy Seal, I ain't slippin' 'til it's safe
One more sip and I can taste it, notice the concentration
Got that fresh juice, it's the end of conversation
Forget about it, it's stellar talent, he's well around it
A better challenge an entire planet he been around it
Get your calendar counting up all the men who doubted
Friends that matter don't flatter you they just get the pound
Gather around it's astounding I quickly think it's crowded
The highly touted get routed without a set to salvage
Since it's valid, I'm setting aside the Caesar salad
Instead of violence I keep the balance and clean my palette
This is Allen in game one when they won
Tyronn Lue, you lose but hope you stay strong
Take the rapping way back into where it came from
You say you stacking my tracks but couldn't name one
Stay hungry, stay cool, play dumb
Skip school and break rules, it's way fun
Grey Goose with Jesus and his gay son
Phase two, it's steak juice; A1[Intro]
Yeah (turn it up, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah
This Haze and young Nok
Yeah, yeah (okay)
This Haze and young Nok
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Baby we can do it, it's nothin to it
Baby we could do it, it's nothin to it
All niiiiight, let's get in-to it
(Baby we can do it, it's nothin to it)
(Baby we can do it, it's nothin to it)
(All niiiiight, let's get in-to it)
Now take your clothes off, relax your mind
Now I'm lookin at your body, it's all right
All niiiiight, let's get in-to it

[Nok]
Yeah, young Nok

C'mon let's go, and take a ride through the city
And I got, two of my favorite hoes wit me
Yeah, Mary Jane and Miss Thang
One for the brain, the other one go bang
I met her at a traffic light
And you could tell by the fake Cartiers that her dude wasn't actin right
We pulled over to get it crackin
Exchanged our names and numbers, I'm old-fashioned
Called her up a week later, tryin to see what's happenin
She said her dude was trippin and we both started laughin
Hahahaaaa, I proceed with askin
"When you comin out, cause I need to be smashin"
Cause baby we could do it, it's nuttin to it
Lights on or off, vibin to the music
Yeah, yeah all night long
Let's do what we do, right or wrong, yep!

[Hook] with ad libs

[Haze]
We could do it, it's nothin to it
We could do it, it's nothin to it
Geah, all night yeah, all night yeah

It's Mr. Do It, baby stick it, let me give it to you all night
It's hard out here for a pimp, I keep a alibi
Never satisfied, Rick Ross'in with my money right
Jimmyyyy, hollllld up
I make 'em jump cliffs, want shit, they'll never get
Clever, which true playa, Jimmy Hayzar future pimp
Got ya girl choosin, ya highness in the buildin
Baby I could see ya booty, you the finest in the buildin
We look better together, just look how I put it to you
Now it's right in your face, and I'm as calm as a lake
Just as smooth as some sand, what you know 'bout some mackin
Like Jimmy Hayzar ain't packin, geah, baby we could do it
Yeah, uhh

[Hook] with ad libs[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Yes, original rhythm, the drum beater
Hi-Tek in the house, Kweli in the house, yo

[Hook: Talib Kweli + (Res)]
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
Yeah, New York to California
The way we do it is fluid just like water
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
Life got a way of sneaking up on ya
The way we do it is fluid just like water

[Verse 1]
C'mon, beat on the drum like bang-bang and tryna maintain
The same frame of mind while the game change
I know you sick of the same thing, we're different so
Stop sticking the needle up in the same vein
The definition of insane, my theory is Big Bang
We hunting for big game, the quick changeover
Got the rappers confused, Tek back on the board
Kweli is back in the booth, let's go

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again
You can say that again

It's independent hustle, it got me on my grind
I flex my pen like a muscle and write a battle rhyme
I got to exercise, I got to get the ghosts out
I got to testify, the legend never die
I'm connected to the struggle, got a little light
And this little light of mine I'm bout to let it shine
I get better with time
So right when you about to say something real slick you like never mind
I stay grounded like airplanes that never fly
I still never come down, I'm forever high
My addiction is American as Devil's Pie
We stay where the snitches live and the rebels die
Men and women might try, numbers never lie
But I'm too fluid, there's no unit that I'm measured by
The nighttime when the ghetto come alive
And the artificial die like Yellow No. 5

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again

Don't it sound African how the voice and the track just blend
The hands get to clapping and, the feet get to tapping and
The power I'm tapping into, it never was accidental
In fact, what a rap ascension to what make Hip Hop so special
You check my Hip Hop credentials, I'm on like I'm rap's potential
It's what I've been sent to do, the task is monumental
These wack emcees make me laugh like Comedy Central
Rappers be acting gassed, it's really not a big issue
They'll lose their bodily tissue, cause something hot just hit you
Just for waving off the nigga tryna politic with you
He's like I gotta get him, I'll try to politic with him
Man he tried to front, that's what he want when these shots hit him
Bet you he change his mind, better learn how to read the danger signs
Try to take my spot, get a number, wait in line
Try to skip, no, get to the back again
Yeah, we back again, you can like rap again, word

[Hook: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
(No matter where you're from
I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again(Kweli)
Whoa, yeah, yeah
When you doing you, and you real fly with it
It's like niggas always wanna check you, know what I'm saying?
Always wanna make sure you keeping it real, keeping it real
Nigga, nigga do you

[Hook: Talib Kweli & (Hi-Tek)]
(Back up offa me, back up offa me)
Won't you get out my face, better stay in your place
I'm fed up, how much can I take
Yo, you need to just
(Back up offa me, back up offa me)
I got money to make, not a minute to waste
I need space when I try to create
Yo, you need to just
(Back up offa me)
See me in the Cut'
(Back up offa me)
Trying to roll up
(Back up offa me)
Or we can roll up
(Back up offa me)
Ay, yo, motherfucker, hold up

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Ton', what is this?
I know he ain't talking, this is grown-man business
Be your own man, stand on your own feet
I thought we was homies
But you comin' at me like you don't know me
You think you do, but you're probably wrong
I'm surrounded by more babies than Ashanti songs, oh baby
I know you don't get it
Try to walk in my shoes, I know you won't fit it
Just cause I know you and your flow, too
There's more to it, you won't get it, I don't owe you
You want Hi-Tek to do a record for you
So niggas is checking for you
Cut the bull, cause niggas get respected for you
Get your own respect dude, that ain't mean and evil
Ain't no crutches in my crew
My crew a crew of equals (yup)
Shit was cool when we was teenagers, we grown men
You my people, but I don't need you moanin' and groanin'
I can't feed you, I already got kids
How a nigga trying to regulate some shit that’s not his?
I ain't trying to sign, I'm just an artist, nigga
I'm just trying to rhyme and go the hardest, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]

Radio suckers never play me cause I don't let them
They like a pimp only hoes sweat them
When I do a show, I love to catch the lady's eye
Dodge the paparazzi, I don't wanna see no lady die
Sports entertainment, academics, business, or politics
The fine hoes swallow dicks for dollars quick
Young broads all up in gangs like the Young Lords
Jump forward, statutory rape, now you done for
What, you thought that shorty 'bout to act a her age
Right now, somebody's daughter is backstage
It's a master-slave relationship, and guess who Toby
It's the white girl in Colorado, and guess who Kobe
Tried to tell you not to fuck with these debutantes
That's more Kobe beef than Japanese restaurants
Don't need diseases or cases, trying to catch nothing
And when they throwing pussy, best believe you catching something
Say "hi" to Tek

[Hook][Hook: Talib Kweli]
This is the ballad of the black gold
They call it Texas tea
But it's bigger than a cowboy with a lasso
It's deeper than a black hole
Create monopolies
Except they collect your fee when you pass Go
Crisis international
The government de facto
We got no control of this fiasco
Darker than the back roads
Bubble hotter than Tabasco
More than what you bargained for or asked for

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
You never see happy, hungry people - that ain't rational
They blasting through the gates and they attack you at the capital
Run up in your palace, find the heads of the state and crack a few
Get a taste of power, then they become fascists too
The fiscal conservatives, don't know what they purpose is
Spend money on the war, then they cut your goods and services
Murderous, corporate monsters is breaking records
Exxon is at 40 billion a year, they raking in record profits. Stop it!
How they banking while the auto industry is tanking?
Leadership is sinking; oil pollution in the water stanking
Loyalty to petroleum royalties spoil the economy
We won't get it poppin' till we oil-free
If you're oil-rich then we invadin'
They call it "occupation," but we losing jobs across the nation
Drill, baby, drill, while they make our soldiers kill, baby still
The desert where the blood and oil spill

[Hook: Talib Kweli]

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Nigeria is celebrating 50 years of independence
They still feel the colonial effects of Great Britain's presence
Dictators quick to imitate the West
Got in bed with oil companies and now the place is a mess
Take a guess, which ones came and violated
They oiled up the soil, the Ogoni people was almost annihilated
But still they never stayed silent
They was activists and poets using non-violent tactics
That was catalyst for soldiers to break into they crib
Take 'em from the kids and try to break 'em like a twig
And make examples of the leaders; executed Saro-Wiwa
Threw Fela's mom out the window right after they beat her
In an effort to defeat hope. Now the people's feet soaked in oil
So the youth is doing drive-bys in speed boats
They kidnap the workers, they blowing up the pipelines
You see the fires glowing in the nighttime

[Hook: Talib Kweli]

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
History: a slippery creature
It's full of plot twists and surprise endings like a mystery feature
This oil shit is slicker than preachers
It make the problems in the region amplified like victory speeches
Poison the water, lead the boys to the slaughter
Go in somebody' country, rearrange the order and destroy the borders
You see 'em dancing through the fields of fire
World domination their real desire
The devil is still a liar

[Hook: Talib Kweli]

[Hook: Talib Kweli]Hook [Mary singing with words by Black Star]
Yes you are (Sometimes you just meet someone and you just completely...)
You're so beautiful
Here we go... come on
Absolutely fantastic, Now you're near
Absolutely fantastic, In my life
Fantastic, All my fears
Fantastic, Beautiful
Fantastic, Come to me
Fantastic, Now I am
Fantastic, Someone watching over me Fantastic

[Mos Def]
I dreamt that I could paint you with words
But there were no colors bright enough
Black or white enough
Blue or green enough, it didn't mean enough
You are the star that touched the earth
Shine bright for all eyes to see
Radiate and touched me
Now I'm shining like you do
It was dim before I knew you
Bright light for weeping eyes to get used to
Trust who? That's some shit to adjust to
Soon as you relax, they ease back and cold bust you
Love murdered in Brooklyn, sound the alarm
But you said remain calm, my passion is unarmed
I tried to practice my war like tactics
But in the clutch of your touch, my armor just collapses
Sun's bliss breeds obliviousness
So recollect sweet breath still wet on my lips
My prayer's this: Go protect my beloved and keep her covered From the valley to the summer like the land undiscovered
(like the stars)

Hook
[Mary]
Beautiful, now you're near in my life all my fear
Beautiful, come to me, now I am, someone watching over me
[Black Star]
Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful
I do all my best so I could be true to you
Ain't nothing in this word that I wouldn't do for you
?? everything usual
Like the stars outnumbered, you are so beautiful
Where I stand, understand who I am, that makes me a man

[Talib Kweli]
You know what, they say that beauty's in the eye of the beholder
So I use my third, and now I love solid like a boulder
Want to be with you as I get older
And that's my word, sure as I stand on my ancestors' shoulders
You see through my drama and my world like a stage
Not the same years but living in the same age
Just the quality, not the quantity
Follow me, definitely
Far from probably, got to be
You and me, beautifully, thick like pieces of the man I used to be
Now I'm back cause of what you do to me
You like my reflection, better half to my whole
Like lyrics to the beat, you're the mate for my soul
The breath for my life, my sister and my lover
Used to have cold feet, now you the one under my covers
I can't ignore your aura but it grabbed me by the hand
Like the moon pulled the tide and the tide pulled the sand

[Hook]
Go ahead, Mary, baby, sing your song
Oh, so beautiful
That dream that it would be so beautiful
I wanna say that I love you
All the love you give, all the love you give to me
All my days and nights were lonely
And it's so beautiful
And now I have a friend that I can talk to, yeah
Boy, you're so beautiful

[Mos Def and Kweli be switching back and forth like a crossfader]
Because you're fruitful, beautiful
Smart, lovable, huggable, doable like art
Suitable to be part of the cosmos
With my eyes closed, I see you clearly
Combined lifetimes with like minds, your lovelight shines
Bright the apple of my eyesight
The tender kiss that whets my appetite
My mighty Aphrodite, the flame that ignite me
Your name just excite me
Your eyes so alive they aright me
Cause you are so beautiful
You don't even know the length I would go
To make absolutely sho' you is respected and protected
And never neglected, I hope my prayers is accapted
That you always will be watched over
And never rocked over
And if you need me to, I'll stop over
To check on you, I'd never jet on you
I know a lot of foolish cats that slept on you
But what I'm gonna do is be totally committed
If you need me I'll be hotter than the New York Mennen
With a hundred percentage, from the start to the finish
Cause the vibe you give leave me so replenished
It's a new beginning, this is serious business
Got my heart and soul in it
It's the way that I'm living
Let it be known that I'm devoted, it's always going to prevail
The newly risen, truely living universal for real
It's like that y'all, and ya don't stop

[Mary]
You're the only love I know, Beautiful
You're the only love that knows, Beautiful
You're the reason why I live, Beautiful
You're the reason why I want to give you everything, Beautiful

...Since you came into my life[Sample]
This is a tear jerker

[Hook]
The revolution's here
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh
No one can change your ways
No one can lead you off your path
You'll try to change the world
So please excuse me while I laugh

[Verse 1: Talib Kweli]
Yo, I heard it's said the revolution won't be televised
But in the land of milk and honey there's a date you gotta sell it by
Otherwise it just expires and spoils
And these folks jump out the pot when the water too hot
Cause the fire boils inside
You go to church to find you some religion
And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradiction and
You try to vote and participate in the government
And the muh'fuckin' Democrats is actin' like Republicans
You join a organization that know black history
But ask them how they plan to make money and it's a mystery
Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you
The revolution's here, the revolution is personal
They call me the political rapper
Even after I tell 'em I don't fuck with politics
I don't even follow it
I'm on some KRS, Ice Cube, Chris Wallace shit
Main Source, De La Soul, bumpin' "2Pacalypse Now"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Yo, I speak at schools a lot cause they say I'm intelligent
No, it's cause I'm dope, if I was whack I'd be irrelevant
I'm like the dope in your tracks until your high is settled in
You leanin' to the left, the laughter's the best medicine
But the troubles you have today you just can't laugh away
Stay optimistic, thinking change is gonna come like Donny Hathaway
You have to pray, on top of that, act today
Cause opportunity shrivel away like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away"
Everybody pass away, the pastor prays, the family mournin'
Everybody act accordin' to the season that they born in (You'll try to change the world)
You fight in the streets, start bleedin' 'til the blood is pourin'
In the gutter, mothers cry 'til the Lord be livin' by the sword and
All that folks want is safety, they goin' gun crazy
The same reason Reagan was playin' war games in the '80s
The same reason I always rock dog chains on my babies
The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Talib Kweli]
It's a beautiful thing that's happenin' right now
Right now G
Yo, I'm rockin' with my man Hi-Tek on the track right now
We fightin' the good fight
The Beautiful Struggle
Yeah, let's go

(So please excuse me while I laugh)[Intro]
Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape
WOO!!!

[Hook]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1]
First we get to talkin, then we get to touchin
If we get past the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Hook][Hi-Tek]
Ah-hah, yeah uhh
Tek-Zilla, Zilla, that's me baby
I know you done heard it all before but uhh
Uhh

I wanna take you back to the good ol' days
Good homecooked food, good ol' steak
Long walks in the park, we would talk forever
Me and you together was the golden era
Never thought you'd be my ex-dame, Jones on the phone
Used to give you long pet names, now I feel alone
Got me zonin off track, lookin at your pics
Feelin like Big, "I want that ol' thing back!"

[Hook: Ayak]
Can we go back to that (2X)
Can we go back, I wanna go back (2X)
Baby
Can we go back to that (2X)
Can we go back, I wanna go back (2X)
Baby

[Ayak - singing]
Holdin hands, in the park
Doin all, the things that lovers do
Is how I remember you
You showered me, with kisses sweet
You made me feel, like I was your queen
Feel safe in your arms just where I wanna be
So wrapped and so in love
We would talk, makin plans sittin on {?} stumps
Long gone are those days
But I say, can we...

[Hook] with ad libs

[Talib Kweli]
Why not, let's do it
You keep it fresh like the 'dro in a sack, you rollin and blowin it back
You growin I'm knowin the game is whack but I know what I lack
Niggas used to love H.E.R. but now she just a ho on the track
She's strippin up though out of stack, I wanna blow out her back
Shame we lowered the rap bars, replaced with this whack
I'm sharp like the slasher that stab ya, hittin ya face with the dagger
Still I be faced with the task of shakin they ass
She gotta bubble like she, takin a bath, we takin it back, yeah

[Ayak - singing]
Lookin back, at what we had
How did it end, it's such a shame baby
Cause you were my all end everything
In my mind, you were fly
But over time, how is it we change
No matter what I wish it won't be the same
Can't rewind to times we were in love
Never thought we'd end up breakin up
Long gone are those days
So what do you say...

[Hook] with ad libs[Intro]
Yeah! Full Surface nigga!

Nigga you can get it if you axe for it

{Screwed: *Or I can go in slower*}
Chop and screw it, have the whole Midwest rockin to it
Have the whole down South snappin to it
Get the whole East coast back into it, I'm the cat to do it
Whole West coast gon' bang to this
I do this for my niggas with 'cane to pitch
They never should have let me get the hang of this
Now I'mma spit game so dangerous
I'm amazin homes, I raise the chrome
Put the lazer on, then blaze the chrome
Better never fuck with Lazy Bone
Can't forget Wish and Krayzie Bone
And best believe that if you fuck with Eve I'm gonna kill you
I rep to the death, F to the S, man it don't get no realer

[Hook 2X: Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me {*3X*}
Cash rules everything around me

[Krayzie Bone]
Nigga better listen to the warnin, run up on a nigga
He'll die and won't nobody find him 'til the mornin
Believe me we ain't scared to put it on ya
Leave you in a field in the Killa Califonia
Nigga make money, get money, big money
Casue when a motherfucker broke ain't shit funny - you can believe
Cash rule everything around me
So don't bring yo' broke ass around me
Spitter, nigga wig out, for the scrilla
Killer, dollar billa
In the middle of the drama
I'mma be goin inside yo' pocket, for the profit
So drop it nigga this Cass' and Bone
Light up some hash and pass the chrome
Any nigga with a misunderstandin gon' get handled
And that's fo' sho'

[Wish Bone]
Nigga shut it down, we don't fuck around
If a nigga disrespect make him lay down
Used to get it in the street now I'm raised up
Nigga lay face ddown, nigga give me that shit
What I'm 'posed to do, when the niggas ride through
With his money, I want it
All I'm tryin to say is been doin this stuff
They fakers don't want it
Hit hard, droppin bodyguards
You don't want what's over here
Nigga better watch your broad, cause she'll tell it all
And we'll bring it over there
Nigga this Bone and Cass' who can fuck with that
If a nigga goes down, ain't nobody gon' rat
We know that, cut 'em all in the face
Whole camp on hush, that's always

[Hook]

[Lazy Bone]
Better give me my money mayne, I ain't runnin game
Me and Lil Cass' like one in the same
We want it, we need it, you better believe it
And if you ain't got it we gunnin mayne
I ain't askin twice, I never been that nice
Ho niggas been killed for a game of dice
He come sho't on the debt and he paid the price
Stayin at home with a safety light
But you chose to gamble, Mr. Rambo
Nigga like that get made example
I'mma tell you like a Biggie sample
Come short on the dough get your contract canceled
I'm up out first with pleny of ammo
This Full Surface nigga hard to handle
Nigga run up bet he get dismantled
Got him glued to the tube, can't change the channel

[Eve]
I was born to be a rich bitch
Can't ever block me from this dough
Nigga ridiculous
Yeah you see me, Hermes head to toe
You want to witness, you can't stop me, pop on the jet
Headed to Paris for a hour just to cop me a dress
You call it crazy, well I call it life
And I'm makin sure I'm all good
Nigga it's hard to rich, fuck broke
I remember that bein in the hood
And I ain't never goin back, fuck that
Got too much in life I want and need
Yeah you haters we love it and love it
Cassidy, Bone and Eve, yeah~!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs
Cassidy (E-V-E) and Bone Thugs (HEY!)[Hook: Talib Kweli + Bahamadia]
We are rhyme sayers, we lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, when the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

[Talib Kweli]

Now I'm much older, lyrically clap MC's
If you don't know by now, let me acquaint you with my steez
(C'mon) I don't get on stage and waste your time
Niggas got a lot to say but they just can't rhyme
They just babies, I snatch em out they incubators
Attach them to respirators, they breathin hard like Darth Vader
Hard as candy and suck like Now or Laters
After a while your style's tasteless and it GOT NO FLAVOR

[Bahamadia]
Projects my eyesights to the heavens like dead or wise sages
Release what I hold sacred through my book of rhyme pages
Scripts be ageless, like scrolls from dead sea
The cadence off and on like the motion of Tai Chi
Ba-ha-ma-D, wor-dy, to Reflect, Eternally
Science to a remedy to help and get my people free, but
Little support, got my thesis on freeze
My only option's doin bootlegs for the Japanese
Get about eight G's, a heavy buzz overseas
Sacrifice a pill to mainstream and do what I believe, cause
Down to the chromosomes I'm a purist to this artform
Enlighten who I touch and let the world catch on

[Talib Kweli + Bahamadia]
Yeah, we your rhyme sayers, who lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, when the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

[Bahamadia]
Oppose for the nine, how no content sections of the earth
Walkin vexed, out of my sticks, laced on every verse
My cells begin to peak at least a hundred thousand hertz
Meanin my joint's prevalent in Fat Beats and Footworks
I cater to these markets first, cause they gravitate to me
And appreciate the vision of what I do musically

[Talib Kweli]
Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm!!
I walked in and they stared, see how they screwin me
Break you down, til you ain't the man you used to be
Domination of my jurisdiction, people's addiction to lies
It blurs the lines between the fact and fiction
Now we back omission, I fix your face for you, keep yappin
You start to hate the man in the mirror like Michael Jackson

[Bahamadia]
Majors they try to hold me captive but mine are figure factions
But the foundation of hip-hop hold my braincells for ransom
I chance none, fuck them spots on charts and number one
If it's meant, then I'll accept it gracious when the time comes
This grassrooted curriculum, got me sprung like twisted ankles
Experience is missable, so I approach it from all angles and
Inject some substance deep inside of rap's core
Takin emceein back to where it was before

[Talib Kweli]
Call us Liberty like the Bell of Philadelphia scenery
Me and Bahama-D, style free like Mumia need to be
Seein me, feelin me, we right here on the level
Turnin hardrocks to pebbles, exposin the devil
Lyrical olympian like John Carlos winnin gold medal
Take that bass out your voice you talk to me in treble
I'm "Serious" as Steady B so you know I ain't playin
I'm stimulatin, makin crowds MOVE like organizations in Philly
Keep it positive, my prerogative is exercise
See through the chaos with my third eye
Word I exhibit the exquitiness, since a child I was vivid
Throw your hands in the air if you with it, dig it

[Talib Kweli + Bahamadia]
Yeah, we your rhyme sayers, who lead you like a beacon
Of light, out of the chaos, cuttin down overzealous
Players who stare, when the winners of the game
Walk in well prepared, climbin the stairways
To heaven while you scared of the people livin under-
-ground heard the sound of the clap, made you wonder
If it was a gun, the crowd, or some thunder
All of that was out my window when I was younger

[Talib Kweli]
Seven-eighteen, to five-one-three
We meet at two-one-five
Reflection Eternal, Bahamadia, yes yes

[Xzibit]
Yo listen the fuck up y'all
It's Mr. X to the Z Xzibit
Broadcastin with the home grown
That's right, they straight out of my backyard
The Beat Junkies, on Rawkus Records understand me?
It's Soundbombing 2![Hook]
Cincinnati
Home of jazz fest and blown spots
Bad cats and mingles, no culture no hip-hop
Black business stopped by cops who roam blocks
Niggas scared to pop, This shit's got to stop

[Verse 1: Main Flow]
The universal man, I caravan through lands of paper
Spectin' from the sands of Cali to the streets of New York State
From the home of bunk shit you thought it was dead
We brought it back like resurrection giving life to these heads
In the middle of the riddles many styles from my locals
Collecting data from the greater to create the bicoastal
Niggas fronting (mumbling) till the answer was handed
I manifest, not just be west, I represent the fucking planet
Holdin' on to my fire, keep my artist inspired
Illuminati based and rest in place for Roman Empire
Used desire, was to lock my soul for something minute
That's why I had to relocate but still come back and recruit
Some say it's not feasible I say people let's get down
Make our dreams come to life through these Hi-Tek sounds
We spread the land like disciples, smash and stifle the borders
New world wide music for a New World Order

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Donte]
I luminate provokes tax where action liver than a smoke stack
Bringing dope back, imagine that no longer broke cats
Up in the heart of it, material shit's hard to miss
Some kids'll play the Ricky Ross role for part of this
I'm deeply into faith, my gangs penetrate
'71 and '75 I play the interstates
Watching for road blocks, old cops, patrol stops
I know a couple heads and sneak them in through loading docks
I gotta get mine 1-800-hip-time
While others sip line, cash travels with quick dimes
My whole committees just hoping things end pretty
No souls and pity we operate from CinCity
They got me time and beast I keep my eyes on signs and leads
Combine and leaks and plus I heard hanus police
Came from the boot of us, its ludicrous he's using us
Cincinnati on the streets, you don't know who to trust

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Holmskillet]
Cincinnati, Sin city
Women pretty with no pity, bitches set you up through a mitte
Come and get he, your worst enemy your running with he
On the field of synergy look at how our end will we
Me myself made a pact, when I bombed in the stacks
Relax made it back, don't get caught in the act
Stand low on in the vigor, they don't know a nigga
Who ain't catching footballs running Deon figures
No neon glitter, which way switch hitter
I'm an eon splitter, little black bitch getter
I've been on my faith since them days decade
Won back to back state and the Rockwell skates
Now them looters feel great chatting Dre escaped
But Ohio's fenced in and we all inmates
Walking up Short Vine, Niggas catch court fines
Miss my court case date capeas fourth time

[Hook][Intro]
What we have here is the alpha and the omega, I spit it
Bear witness to the greatest and the latest
They try to hate us, yo

[Verse 1]
Witness the evolution of spitting, it's wicked and it's decadent
Revolutions per minute every time the record spin
Retribution for cynics like a stick-up kid with weapons
In Brooklyn they say I run it, the 'Natti is checking in
No matter the terminology, blood splatter artistically
It's looking like a Jackson Pollock painting, it's a mystery
Really should be brothers united against the industry
The african diaspora scatter with shattered history
The game missing me, rap is so repetitive
Although I ain't your blood or your cuz, it's all relative
I got a gang of rhymes, and Tone's beats is banging
We moving through the streets like we slanging dimes
It's magical, how the track so classical
To cats who got gats tucked in they sweats like Plaxico
I'm back from my sabbatical, voice of the future
Black radical, keeping all the damage as collateral

[Hook]
Listening to instrumentals
Thinking bout all the things I've been through
The music just a peek into my life as a window
It's so Hi-Tek and it's all so simple
Even if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on the city playground
Hotter than the tar on the city playground

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo, I'm taking all bets, I'm settling all debts
A giant leap for man begin with the small steps
From a sword to a set, to my people on the picket line
Who sick of getting treated like them aliens in District 9
I juxtapose my business mind with my spirit
What, I'm just supposed to keep you comfortable with the lyrics?
I know the flow disturbing, I know for certain
Just because you know all about the artist don't mean you know the person
You don't know me, I run labels
These unstable rappers so phoney
I try to listen but they as boring as missionary position
So I'm shitting on these niggas like dysentery conditions
I'm sitting on the throne, you dreaming that it's empty soon
Nobody feeling you, you screaming in an empty room
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest, don't get me started

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I build up my defenses when I'm left to my devices
Time gets suspended more than DMX driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is? Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything a minor crisis
I'm making sacrifices, my history is black as Isis
I don't think that I can trust you if you lack in vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slur
They takes my words, try to twist 'em like a Swisher Sweet with sticky herb
American History X, your teeth will hit the curb
It's easy cause I'm ill with the wordplay, I still flip the bird
Like Jeezy, we stripped it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is "The Emperor's New Clothes"
Although I'm always by myself, I never ride alone
The music on, then I'm right at home, zoning

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it's the pavement, word is bond
Don't be scared to think man, don't be scared
I know what's in your brain, it's scary man
You're only using like ten per cent
The other ninety per cent is scary man
But don't be scared, scary ass niggas, ay![Nate Dogg]
Just yesterday I had to turn a bitch away
I got to many on my side - I got to many in my face
Come ride with me
Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen
Thats the way that its supposed to be
When you do see me
Mobbin wit a gangsta lean
Got a piece by my side
You can ride baby close your eyes girl

[Hook: Nate Dogg, Butch Cassidy, & Kokane]
I'm so cool
Cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool

[Butch Cassidy]
It's me I'm back again
It's never gonna end
I know y'all heard it all before
I just gotta give ya more
Catch me rollin in the night
If I turn off my lights
The eastsidaz in the game
You hear my voice and know my name
You should bang this down on your block
All through your hood
Burnin trees...burnin trees
Ladies let the music run right through you
Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy

[Hook]

[Tray-Dee]
I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up
Take this move, this groove and still G it up
Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke
Pimpin hoes down south, back east to west coast
Im Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze
Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez
Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride
As I exit I step with my stacey shine
I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool
Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back
Now let me break it down a notch
Smooth like I do when I pound the cock
We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block
Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot
We so cool now

[Kokane & Goldie Loc]
If everybody turn there radios on at twelve o'clock
We'll make the world pop

[Goldie Loc]
It's too good right now
Blunkey blunkey
Remmey remmey
Plenty gumbo
Snoop gimme some mo'
Swakin that like a damn fool
Acedemics stacey adams feelin way to cool
Theres alot things that make me wanna frown though
But I'm grinnin like a motherfucka
Throwin dogg pound up
Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet
It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats
I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much
Talk shit to the homies cuz they know whats up
As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle
Still got patience still makin niggas
I just wanna be myself
What I receive from the homies is help
We had a conversation today about who ain't pitchin in
Keep suckas away that don't fit in
I'm so cool

[Hook]

*Kokane mumbling until the end*[Intro repeat 14x: Skillz]
Un un un un, come on nigga

[Skillz] (Missy Elliott)
I be the S-K-I, double L, Z'n
Block is hot again, guess who's the reason?
Your favorite rapper, I got his ass not breathin
You seen me with Missy so it's VA season
Like (Hollaaaaa!) check the flow
And if you a hater, exit the door
Rap is a set up, just a lot of games
A lot of suckas with colorful names
I'm so and so, I'm this, I'm that
But all y'all cats rap about is cars and crack
And these R&B cats, spammers
What chu think, you sound better with a wife beater and a bandana?
(Hey!) Hunh, you fools need to stop
Half y'all got paid studying pop
And as far as these beats, I spit sparks to them
I'm sick in the booth, aiyyo shorty talk to 'em, like...

[Hook: Kandi (Missy)]
Y'all don't really wanna fuck with me
My click D double E to the P
(Ahhhhh!) I put two in ya side
Flow in ya doe in ya motherfucking ride
Y'all really wanna fuck with me?
My click D double E to the P
(Ahhhhh!) I put two in ya chest
Ain't no other yet cause I'm the motherfucking best

[Skillz]
Yo, stop what your doin, cause I'm about to ruin...
These half-ass rappers your used to
So who the fuck wanna battle me?
I spit slugs out my mouth bout the size of a C battery
Like, "chik chik chik", put it down, man
Half of y'all cats lying on your sound scan
And you sold what? That was the amount?
Come on nigga, you know sample tapes don't count
Real quick out the stash, been flippin at dash
Bruise me with two feet when I'm kicking yo' ass
And you never catch me in the club leaving a skirt
If I don't get brains then the meter get jerk
Y'all them fools in the club with a Smedian shirt
Rent a car in your hometown just to see if it work
For 18 years, your momma been feedin a jerk
I spit something hot, have you getting wheezy like Turk, nigga

[Hook]

[Skillz]
Aiyyo, say blast I'mma blast, while y'all play dummies
Hunh, thinking I ain't gon get this money
Watch me come through spit sick and get fly
Beat you on your best day on your best try, and...
(Y'all don't really wanna...)
Dig out the stash cause I probably.. on yo' ass
And my words make the track get up
While I move on it, groove on it
And keep you flows on the cut like...
Rockin mic's, y'all know how we get down
Catch me on tour when I slide through your town
I'm hit bound, y'all lay down flat
The new "King of VA", who's fuckin with that?

[Hook]
