[Intro: Lil Wayne and Tity Boi]
(Yeah!) Weed and syrup 'til I die

As a matter of fact, it's gon' kill me, BITCH!
Cause you ain't! (Tell 'em, shawty!)
So get high (Tell 'em, Weezy!) or get low

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball

Look honey - I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin

[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
The beat so hot, the flow is so ice cold
Walk into the Gucci store, honey I'm home
I am on my shit I need a Pamper on
Toilet paper on the side for example homie
I, get, money
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this
And while you wishing on that fallin' star
I'm in a foreign car smoking out with the doors ajar
Suede sun roof hanging out the big top
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop
You niggas barely dressing I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressing I'm on my Thousand Island
Wildin, styling, I be
I get so much money it's my I.D
Don't try me and if I don't do nuthin I'mma fuckin ball
And I ain't bout to start runnin nawl nigga nawl

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball

Look honey - I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Get money

[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Ain't nothin to a boss we ballin when you see us
We hear them haters callin they too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've won't do with us true enough
Need a ho break a ho never nuthin new to us
Turnin hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Til' then fuck it I'm winning so I'mma stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens
Next time you're yapping make sure it be about big money talk
Let that lil' money walk
Call me what you want but don't call me for front
Southside I got what you want come holla at me

[Hook x2 Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball
I'm countin all day like a clock on a wall

And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Look honey - I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Get money[Shareefa]
Feel like niggas taking us as a joke
Gotta show 'em who boss
My team gotta eat

You niggas be stupid and come with that beef shit you losin
My squad is guerillas no questions don't like us then sue us
A natural disaster I follow the footsteps of Luda
It's my time to shine
Don't need no co-signer I speak through my music I'm tighter
Than any female in your camp, see I'm taking the title
Think I don't see these snakes hatin on me
Time to expose these chicks soundin like me

[Lil' Fate]
Cheah! Lil' Fate, nigga
G-Road, Southside

You niggas can't compete, I do this in my sleep
Dream about money, laying on million dollar sheets
Look at my feet, Louis, Gucci
To me Bathing Ape cheap, truly who he
Thank he is lookin all fruity?
Ghetto-ass nigga got some money and turned bougie
Look at all them groupies, bopping, jocking
Fuck that shit, Lil' Fate's a problem, and you can't stop him

[Tity Boi]
I got a buncha shit
I got a buncha shit

Buncha flows, buncha dough, me and a buncha hoes
Drop some elbows on to ya, call 'em Dusty Rhodes
I done bought alot of ice, I don't fuck with clothes
I was a felon, you see me fail
Now the truck so big I need CDL's
Only child that's poverty stricken
Project lifestyle, I will get rid of you nigga
Quicker than a sack off in the trap
Do it like the dons do it
I'mma serve the next car that come through here

[Dolla Boy]
We defeated the odds, my squad is the realest
End up reaching the stars, they say the sky was the limit
From the start to the finish the hardest that did it
Anything different is not realistic, we're not listening
This is now a intro of a click called DT
Punch you in your shit folk, get wrong, silencer hit home
Ugly when they hit home
Tell them sucka niggas we from Southside we been on, we been on

[Brolic D]
Now I'm the hood's best I dun travel the long road up on this rap quest
Strap vest young'n, North Carolina accent
Don't act amped, Mac 10 bring truth with its back stance
Black bands on the money knots when I'm in the spot
Posted whipping pigeons in the kitchen for them lemon drops
I'll fix ya when I hit ya clip hit ya for your lemon pop
Nowadays I ain't on the block pitching but I'm in the spot shifting
For the top and the 6 is from the lot

[Perfect Harmony]
Oasis of this desert rap mirage hierarchy
KN guns play for the your Suns like Barkley
So don't bother me, we got choppers like west coast or Orange County
Born with that norm about me
They be high up like a balcony
Inspiration get it out of me especially when they doubting me
I'll never go back to the Bedford Drive way of living
Cause I thrive on precision you're high off wisdom
Yes I am a Christian, I make niggas listen
How my intermission one time found it's way in prison
Cause I don't act up, make you think
You hear that loud beep on a Mack Truck, ya hear me? Yeeeah!

[Small World]
Since I been wit a DTP, man everything just been better man
Better whips, better chains, better grip in the bank
Extra clips cause the young boy gun got better aim
Young veteran, let me spell my name, S-M-A-L-L-W-O-R-L-D
You will honor me, cover y'all niggas in dirt like pottery
My influence on this earth's surface is certain 4.4 certain to blow
You who it's curtains fo' when it's for Kurtis Blows
This here for the world to know, we fixing to blow like Merlin's nose
Twist chicks and curl they toes, then twist and twirl the dro

[Smoke]
They say roses are red so is the gold on my neck
They say violets are blue and then my diamonds are too
D.T.P., got me on the bubble like court top
Since I met Luda I been playing diamond like shortstops
Sportin' rocks whiter than caucasians
Yellower than a coward tar hills in my red chain
Bluer than Smurfette's face, see through like an X-Ray
Thanks to Chak and Jeff lots of wealth
Blocks and bells and stock and shares, I'm outta here

[Shawn J]
Man, when it come to getting head I'm the local champ
The only male that get licked more than a postage stamp
It's a house in my garage, the car came with a green card
If you're a peon that means it's Eu-ro-pean
Punch lines bruise egos, rap Zab Judah
Don't get *Furious 2 Fast* and *Crash* like Luda
Get dashed on, Bobby Johnson that ass
Got potatoes for haters, niggas want beef, they get mashed on

You ain't know? Shawn mothafuckin' J, D.T.P
FPI, every mothafuckin..

[I-20]
It's the verse that you been waiting on, from the nigga they be hating on
20 is the anchor every bitch is conversating on
Your crib got square feet, too much for me to talk about
You saving for your car note, my driveway's a parking lot
Eastside OG, they hate it when a nigga leave
I'm coming up in this world, you niggas dry heave
This is my speed I been here from the first day
Y'all niggas can't take our spot, y'all just valets

[Ludacris]
Motherfuckin right. You betta understand it man, it's a Family Affair
Disturbing Tha Peace. Ludacris on the microphone
And as I told you before, we just getting started
That's right. We don't die, we multiply, nigga
So whoever want it, come on and get it
Whatever you want, we could supply it
That's right dammit
Oh wait a second y'all thought I wasn't gonna rap on this motherfucker too?
I'm the boss nigga, look...

Motherfucker, I'm a monster in this game, I thought I told you before
Fans so geeked up you think I sold them some blow
They sold on the flow, this rap game I'm closin the do'
5 years in a motherfucking row, who want it? I got it
Cuz my raps are chaotic, your face blue like Hypnotiq
Cause I'm a multi-millionaire who still using Ebonics
Or country grammar we gon' bananas in South Atlanta
Jesus was a carpenter so we're proud about cocking them hammers. Nigga

I'mma leave you with that, think about. Let's go...[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I say money ain't a thing to a big dog
Ain't got nothing but some cash and my big balls
And I got my good and I got my guns
And I got my goons where the supposed to be
And I say murder ain't a thing to a big dog!
It go (POW POW) like a big dog
Hello world, I'm ready
Nigga ain't getting love from me!!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I'm in a Maserati and it cost one-forty
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
I'm soaring in something foreign, shawty, fuck your boyfriend!
I am so fly, it look like I get dressed in a Hartsfield
Go head learn homicide, boy you know my car kill!
Orange and black Chevy, damn I'm ridin' Garfield
Standing by the bar, still running up my bar bill
Yeah I push weight, my bag feel like a barbell
I'm a big dog, look at my big dog watch
See we the big dogs that all the big dogs watch
Got this constipated flow, you know this shit's on lock
And shawty even when it's cold, they be like Tity Boi hot
Ya dig?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Shawty wanna go to the mall, so I took her
Keep it on the low, man, I just left her sister
More mail then the rest of the pushers
Because I got another bird in the bushes
Brick up, baby, the other shit whipped
I ain't with that, baby, drop top maybe
We can do a deal, something sweet like Sadie
If not, I'm getting money, it go "Fuck you! Pay me!"
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
If worse get to worst, we can just go to war
What'd you think all the guns is for?
Four 5's, four 4's, I'm fly, we soar high

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Diamond around my neck, chest all iced up
Harley so fly, got my bitch the new matching truck
Birdman, you find one in every neighborhood
Get money, flip money, killing, understood?
Big whale, big fish and a big car
Hundred cars, parking lot like a movie star
Duffle boys, in every whip a nigga play
Alligator with the swade on them 28's

[Hook][Intro: Lil Wayne]
Move, mu... shoot with that {316 Production}
And if you can't feel it I'mma touch ya
Nothin' makes a situation better than chedda
And I'm cuttin' through that cheese like a Shredder
So I guess I'm famous like a Ninja Turtle
But I ain't got nothin', nothin' but money
Cuz if I don't do, if I don't do

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothin' I'mma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy
Say go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy (Get money)
I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Remix baby)
Look honey, I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Get money)

[Lil Wayne]
+Tha Block is Hot+, the flow is so ice cold
Walkin' into the bank, honey I am home
I am on that shit they got me dancin' on
Anotha planet to a screwed Janet Jackson song
I talk real crazy, but they still pay me
Said goodbye to the game, but I'm still wavin'
And no disrespect to the lil' ladies
But fuck nine months, I hustle all year baby
All yeah baby, I know you lovin' that
DB with a DB, dope boy wit a duffle bag
Wit a duffle bag, Tity put it in the air
Call me Mr. President or call me Mr. Every Pair
Or Mr. Everywhere or Mr. Never Care
Or Mr. Never Scared, no you could never scare
Me, yeah me in the kitchen wit that big pot
Bitch I'm on my, bitch I'm on my tick tock, tick tock

[Hook]

{New Playaz Circle}

[Dolla Boy]
Hail to the streets, cuz the streets is what made me
Still the same I hate hoes and they hate me
If a nigga owe me, believe he gon pay me
I signed wit Def Jam but I don't know Jay-Z
Beat the, beat the death like Weezy F Baby
Just like Khaled say "We the Best, We the Best"
Duffle bag boys Dolla Tit ya wanna meet the rest
Big Cap, J dot, beats that's hot

[Tity Boi]
Yes I am a beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I don't wanna talk I let my fo' fo' speak
And I like my Sprite Pepto pink
Yeah I get moola, I put work on a ruler
I like good brain, but I'm lookin for a tutor
I got on so much jewlery that I feel like a cooler
But cooler, ya dig?

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
I'mma get 'em my attention
Ok Dipset, Santana, let's go, ya dig?

Aye I push those whips, pass those hoes
Got a money overload, my duffle bag won't close (uh oh)
I'm driving by, you just standin' starin'
We flyin' high, you just prepare for landin'
I'm so fresh from my stitchin' to my belt
From my jewels to my shoes, I take pictures of myself (Cheese)
And that money's my wife, she ain't signin' a prenup
She gon love me for life (why), cuz I know how to treat her

[Birdman]
Stunna Man so I'm headin' to the Phantom shop
Cop 3 now I'm headin' to the rim shop
Took a Jet to Jersey on Ms. Lee's island
You know me homey, bout this money and power
Big, timin', straight, hustlin'
Up-town, wit the, muscle
Get, money, dark, shades
Stay, high, ready, spray

[Hook] - 2X[Verse 1: Dolla Boy]
Ain't sitting around in yo top back
All I'm trying to do is make a dollar don't accomplish that
Probably both, call the hoes
See if she can meet me up at Pompadors
Table in the front so I can see who's in and out the door
We ain't gotta front cause we've been making lots of dough
We ain't taking fronts unless you bringing in a lot of dough
Probably if Jaquari was just starving I'd be robbing folks
Frontin in ?? and it can leave you in the hospital
Came a long way but we still got some miles to go
Cowards gonna despise us, but the real niggas like us though
Sorry my rival put a stop to your theatricals
The streets want the real and honored that we happy for them
And then you realize everything come and it goes
I'm tryin get before it comes and it goes

[Hook: Tity Boi (aka 2 Chainz)]
Diamonds on my wrist, ladies in the building
If you feeling sexy put your drinks to the ceiling
Yaaa, do it like them playaz do
And we on them drugs we goin' be here for a day or two

[Verse 2: Tity Boi (aka 2 Chainz)]
?? county tags blowing smoke out the roof
Tell your man he's a fag and I'm the motherfucking truth (I'm the truth)
See I don't like to brag but he's the proof
The trunk bigger than your future, I'm too tall for a coupe (For a coupe)
And this is something that I'd rather do
Flip the script cover my tattoos Armani is the suit
Mari is the shoes, VS is the juice and the necklace is fruits see the rest of my dudes
Got on vest and the True's
On yo best day I move
Like a man on the moon
Gotta expand it and move it
We land it and cruise
Got plans before truants
Spend grands on the cruise to put a tan on my bruises
And this is how we do it, straight shots with no chasers
And every round I'm making toasts to show off my bracelet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludachris]
My bank accounts are impatient and they, they can't wait
So I'm never a dollar short, or a, a day late
I smoke the best for the stress just to, to stay straight
The bud's light is less filling, but it, it tastes great
I keep the cash in the stash from the, the po po
Cause they say it won't hurt them, what they, they don't know
Though i roll in the coupe that hugs the whole block
Don't play I'm still hood, you'll still get cold cocked
The four will sure pop
Your soul will sure drop
Fours will get blown but i sure do hope not, I'm hot
But I ain't tripping on these young whipper snappers
I'm trying to get a chick up in my whip and get her snapper
Put her on her stomach get back and then slap her
Take her to her home and be gone the morning after

[Hook][Intro: Ving Rhames]
He's a hustler, unbound by law
A self-made, millionaire
With a wreckless disregard, for the haters
Ludacris, on "Southern Gangsta"...
A true, entrepre-negro
CEO of Disturbing Tha Peace Records
He expanded his empire into multiple profitable businesses
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits
Internet sites, WeMix.com
And my favorite, MyGhetto.com
The MVP, of this rap shit

[Ludacris]
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer
I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)
Spit 30 large for cigars of you ho niggas (oww!)
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you, into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the "Port of Miami"
To keepin it "Trilla"
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
He's worth eight figures
So young niggas, boss up
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss

[Rick Ross]
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said "We were hustlers"
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillrs
Frontin at awards, real street niggas
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass
Big ass face, chop you in your laugh face
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
Hailing from College Park, Georgia
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob
Or illegal organization
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week
Selling mid-grade, they were some high-rollin hustlers
Tity Boi, and Dolla Boy
Playaz Circle, A.K.A., the Duffle Bag Boys

[Tity Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support strippers
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)
(White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow)
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late
Ain't no such thing as second place
(And every day I live heavyweight, you niggas featherweight)
(Fairytale tellin niggas really need to take a break)
And the estate got a lake for a backyard
(The pool room product put it all on my sacks card)
For real? (Yeah, for real)
I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will
(I got dogs like Cujo, me and Tity two chains ridin in a two do')
Bitches catch kudos (you know)
Yeah we move weight like sumos
And kicks it with them bitches like judo
SOUTHSIDE!

[Outro: Ving Rhames]
Playaz Circle, Rick Ross, Ludacris
This has been another episode, of "Southern Gangsta"
Thanks for tunin in, what's next for Luda?
Well, anything's possible, in the +Theater of the Mind+[Hook: Shawn Jay/ Tity Boi (2 Chainz)]
This the hardest beat I ever heard
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
You see them 24's on the curb
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
You see them big blunts full of purp
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
Everything I got I worked for
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit

[Verse 1: Shawn Jay]
Shawn Jay the type to break a ho, young chasin major dough
Cut the check with DTP, now chickens try and play me close
Ballin in the mall with Chaka, shoppin for the latest clothes
Turn your lady to a bopper, watch how I take your ho
Niggas see I get that money, now they wanna wait to blow
Underground grindin, perfect timing in a crazy flow
Put Georgia on your mind and now I'm ridin on the radio
Your ass ain't no DJ, my advise stop playin me folk

[Verse 2: Smoke]
I'm ridin in my drop cut, these 24 inch not scrubbin
In my plastic sack, I got more purple than Baby Bops buddy
So materialistic, we're chopping early today
What rolls around my throat, arm wristed in a bouqet
15's in the back blasting, Peep the candy as I pass em
Watch the chamillion paint flop, like Chingy's last album
Cocoa Chanelle frames, on woodgrain
Old grain blown thangs on my hip, but that's the clips

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
I'm married to the streets and this beef shit's apart of it
Jumped out with heat, niggas didn't want no parts of it
Pull up in the club, looking like they wanna start something
Fuckin all these niggas hoes, that ain't ever dawned on me
Tired of the fussin, bitches blushin, bumrushin
The car treat me like a star but I ain't done nuttin
Summer almost over with but I ain't done frontin
They hate we gettin money, we gon make these niggas love it

[Verse 4: Tity Boi (2 Chainz)]
Pay my dues, takin crews, just me and my haitian dudes
Makin loot, even made the news in my gator shoes
Three fifty seven Glock, nine, a tech twenty two
Everything I ride in on at least twenty twos
This hustler music is what you hear in them drug zones
They play it in their chevy loud plus it's a club song
That's seven fourty five, that's my whip
The biggest house in the neighborhood, that's my shit

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Perfect Harmony]
I get high like cooley, ruling with the toolin
On a 22, still got that uzi in that hoopty
Niggas all flashy, showing off their jewelry
Til I shoot it through their heart like cupid
Give it to 'em raw like sushi, then I'm back on the groupies
Young nigga with a gun nigga, Norfclik where I'm from nigga
Shut up and roll that blunt nigga and I don't even stunt nigga
Quiet cause I hit them lips, roll up on a nigga with a clip now that's my shit

[Verse 5: Ludacris]
I may be rich but never satisfied, making hoes camera shy
Comin down topping blades, call me The Last Samurai
I'll cut cha, gun butt cha, Knuck ya then buck ya
It calls for Hammer Time if you think we can't touch ya
Cause we too legit to quit, nigga run up on your click nigga
Not action heroes but we all making six figures
So put your choice to it, women get moist to it
A songs worth a million once I lend my fucking voice to it

[Hook][Hook: Lil Wayne]
I say money ain't a thing to a big dog

Standing by the bar, still running up my bar bill

We can do a deal, something sweet like Sadie
If not, I'm getting money, it go "Fuck you! Pay me!"
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
If worse get to worst, we can just go to war
What'd you think all the guns is for?
Four 5's, four 4's, I'm fly, we soar high

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Diamond around my neck, chest all iced up
Harley so fly, got my bitch the new matching truck

[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Ain't nothin to a boss we ballin when you see us
We hear them haters callin they too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've won't do with us true enough
Need a ho break a ho never nuthin new to us
Turnin hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Til' then fuck it I'm winning so I'mma stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens
Next time you're yapping make sure it be about big money talk
Let that lil' money walk
Call me what you want but don't call me for front
Southside I got what you want come holla at me

[Hook x2 Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball

Look honey - I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin

Move, mu... shoot with that {316 Production}
And if you can't feel it I'mma touch ya
Nothin' makes a situation better than chedda
And I'm cuttin' through that cheese like a Shredder
So I guess I'm famous like a Ninja Turtle
But I ain't got nothin', nothin' but money
Cuz if I don't do, if I don't do

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothin' I'mma ball

Look honey, I ain't never ran from a nigga

[Lil Wayne]
+Tha Block is Hot+, the flow is so ice cold
Walkin' into the bank, honey I am home
I am on that shit they got me dancin' on
Anotha planet to a screwed Janet Jackson song
I talk real crazy, but they still pay me
Said goodbye to the game, but I'm still wavin'
And no disrespect to the lil' ladies
But fuck nine months, I hustle all year baby
All yeah baby, I know you lovin' that
DB with a DB, dope boy wit a duffle bag
Wit a duffle bag, Tity put it in the air
Call me Mr. President or call me Mr. Every Pair

[Hook]

{New Playaz Circle}

[Dolla Boy]
Hail to the streets, cuz the streets is what made me
Still the same I hate hoes and they hate me
If a nigga owe me, believe he gon pay me
I signed wit Def Jam but I don't know Jay-Z
Beat the, beat the death like Weezy F Baby
Just like Khaled say "We the Best, We the Best"
Duffle bag boys Dolla Tit ya wanna meet the rest
Big Cap, J dot, beats that's hot

[Tity Boi]
Yes I am a beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I don't wanna talk I let my fo' fo' speak
And I like my Sprite Pepto pink
Yeah I get moola, I put work on a ruler
I like good brain, but I'm lookin for a tutor
I got on so much jewlery that I feel like a cooler
But cooler, ya dig?

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
I'mma get 'em my attention
Ok Dipset, Santana, let's go, ya dig?

Aye I push those whips, pass those hoes
Got a money overload, my duffle bag won't close (uh oh)
I'm driving by, you just standin' starin'
We flyin' high, you just prepare for landin'
I'm so fresh from my stitchin' to my belt
From my jewels to my shoes, I take pictures of myself (Cheese)
And that money's my wife, she ain't signin' a prenup
She gon love me for life (why), cuz I know how to treat her

[Birdman]
Stunna Man so I'm headin' to the Phantom shop
Cop 3 now I'm headin' to the rim shop
Took a Jet to Jersey on Ms. Lee's island
You know me homey, bout this money and power
Big, timin', straight, hustlin'
Up-town, wit the, muscle
Get, money, dark, shades
Stay, high, ready, spray

[Hook] - 2X[Shareefa]
Feel like niggas taking us as a joke
Gotta show 'em who boss
My team gotta eat

You niggas be stupid and come with that beef shit you losin
My squad is guerillas no questions don't like us then sue us
A natural disaster I follow the footsteps of Luda
It's my time to shine
Don't need no co-signer I speak through my music I'm tighter
Than any female in your camp, see I'm taking the title
Think I don't see these snakes hatin on me
Time to expose these chicks soundin like me

[Lil' Fate]
Cheah! Lil' Fate, nigga
G-Road, Southside

You niggas can't compete, I do this in my sleep
Dream about money, laying on million dollar sheets
Look at my feet, Louis, Gucci
To me Bathing Ape cheap, truly who he
Thank he is lookin all fruity?
Ghetto-ass nigga got some money and turned bougie
Look at all them groupies, bopping, jocking
Fuck that shit, Lil' Fate's a problem, and you can't stop him

[Tity Boi]
I got a buncha shit
I got a buncha shit

Buncha flows, buncha dough, me and a buncha hoes
Drop some elbows on to ya, call 'em Dusty Rhodes
I done bought alot of ice, I don't fuck with clothes
I was a felon, you see me fail
Now the truck so big I need CDL's
Only child that's poverty stricken
Project lifestyle, I will get rid of you nigga
Quicker than a sack off in the trap
Do it like the dons do it
I'mma serve the next car that come through here

[Dolla Boy]
We defeated the odds, my squad is the realest
End up reaching the stars, they say the sky was the limit
From the start to the finish the hardest that did it
Anything different is not realistic, we're not listening
This is now a intro of a click called DT
Punch you in your shit folk, get wrong, silencer hit home
Ugly when they hit home
Tell them sucka niggas we from Southside we been on, we been on

[Brolic D]
Now I'm the hood's best I dun travel the long road up on this rap quest
Strap vest young'n, North Carolina accent
Don't act amped, Mac 10 bring truth with its back stance
Black bands on the money knots when I'm in the spot
Posted whipping pigeons in the kitchen for them lemon drops
I'll fix ya when I hit ya clip hit ya for your lemon pop
Nowadays I ain't on the block pitching but I'm in the spot shifting
For the top and the 6 is from the lot

[Perfect Harmony]
Oasis of this desert rap mirage hierarchy
KN guns play for the your Suns like Barkley
So don't bother me, we got choppers like west coast or Orange County
Born with that norm about me
They be high up like a balcony
Inspiration get it out of me especially when they doubting me
I'll never go back to the Bedford Drive way of living
Cause I thrive on precision you're high off wisdom
Yes I am a Christian, I make niggas listen
How my intermission one time found it's way in prison
Cause I don't act up, make you think
You hear that loud beep on a Mack Truck, ya hear me? Yeeeah!

[Small World]
Since I been wit a DTP, man everything just been better man
Better whips, better chains, better grip in the bank
Extra clips cause the young boy gun got better aim
Young veteran, let me spell my name, S-M-A-L-L-W-O-R-L-D
You will honor me, cover y'all niggas in dirt like pottery
My influence on this earth's surface is certain 4.4 certain to blow
You who it's curtains fo' when it's for Kurtis Blows
This here for the world to know, we fixing to blow like Merlin's nose
Twist chicks and curl they toes, then twist and twirl the dro

[Smoke]
They say roses are red so is the gold on my neck
They say violets are blue and then my diamonds are too
D.T.P., got me on the bubble like court top
Since I met Luda I been playing diamond like shortstops
Sportin' rocks whiter than caucasians
Yellower than a coward tar hills in my red chain
Bluer than Smurfette's face, see through like an X-Ray
Thanks to Chak and Jeff lots of wealth
Blocks and bells and stock and shares, I'm outta here

[Shawn J]
Man, when it come to getting head I'm the local champ
The only male that get licked more than a postage stamp
It's a house in my garage, the car came with a green card
If you're a peon that means it's Eu-ro-pean
Punch lines bruise egos, rap Zab Judah
Don't get *Furious 2 Fast* and *Crash* like Luda
Get dashed on, Bobby Johnson that ass
Got potatoes for haters, niggas want beef, they get mashed on

You ain't know? Shawn mothafuckin' J, D.T.P
FPI, every mothafuckin..

[I-20]
It's the verse that you been waiting on, from the nigga they be hating on
20 is the anchor every bitch is conversating on
Your crib got square feet, too much for me to talk about
You saving for your car note, my driveway's a parking lot
Eastside OG, they hate it when a nigga leave
I'm coming up in this world, you niggas dry heave
This is my speed I been here from the first day
Y'all niggas can't take our spot, y'all just valets

[Ludacris]
Motherfuckin right. You betta understand it man, it's a Family Affair
Disturbing Tha Peace. Ludacris on the microphone
And as I told you before, we just getting started
That's right. We don't die, we multiply, nigga
So whoever want it, come on and get it
Whatever you want, we could supply it
That's right dammit
Oh wait a second y'all thought I wasn't gonna rap on this motherfucker too?
I'm the boss nigga, look...

Motherfucker, I'm a monster in this game, I thought I told you before
Fans so geeked up you think I sold them some blow
They sold on the flow, this rap game I'm closin the do'
5 years in a motherfucking row, who want it? I got it
Cuz my raps are chaotic, your face blue like Hypnotiq
Cause I'm a multi-millionaire who still using Ebonics
Or country grammar we gon' bananas in South Atlanta
Jesus was a carpenter so we're proud about cocking them hammers. Nigga

I'mma leave you with that, think about. Let's go...[Hook: x4]
Look what I got, got
Guap so my shit fresh out the lot
Hop Hop Hop Hop Hop out the drop I'm yellin look what I got

I'm a Trap Starr my pants saggin
Pistol Showin D-boy swaggin
So fresh I need a camera
So fresh I'm a need some Magnums
Gotta magnum, in a magnum
7 4 5 with a 4 5
Cool as ever but don't confuse I air this bitch out dey don't know I
They don't know I'm On g-road
They don't know I'm always on
It's 6 below I'm in the cold my top is droppin my heat is on
South side believe it homes
Diamonds on, you see em homes
You won't see D no Turn the Key Go to Tennessee That's beezys home
Brace yourself we takin off, Pistol Loaded my safety's off
Paint is wet, my leather's soft
And There's some Lames we'll take they salt
Costarr La nostra get closea see toastas we get dough like Oprah
It's PC it's ova

[Hook x4]

Tity-2 chainz I got on 2 bracelets
Fresh off the lot you would think I was racin'
Pinky ring hi, at the bar wine tastin
I paint all my cars black you would think I was racist
A.T.L.A.N.T.A C.O. double L. E.G.E
Park my car in the valet my white T smells just like a P
When I say P I mean a pound when I say T I mean a town
So take these P's to the T Let's go in the key let's lock it down
See Kingpin's were my role models, Your TV was a floor model
Had a T.V in my impala with a few dollars new pradas
Deuce holla, we outtie, Niggas know we got it
We fresh off the block I'm goin Mazaradi shoppin

[Hook x3][Hook: Phonte]
I got money, lots of jewels and fancy cars
(They say I'm wrong) But, baby don't blame me
I'm just a paper chaser
Paid my dues and now I cruise with movie stars
(They say I'm wrong) But, baby don't blame me
I'm just a paper chaser

..

[Tity Boi]
They wanna know where my name from, where I came from
Where I Florian Champagne dunn
Arm & Hammer grammar, campaign on it
Propane slang, put the flame on it
I was so hungry, I could eat a house
Then shit it out, til I figured out a different route
I'm tryna get clout, cash and a Black card
So now even my pool got a backyard
Now it's time to fast-forward, speed up the process
I'm so fresh, I could fuck her off my outfit
Ridin in the cockpit, ridin with the top back
Ridin on some butt-nicks, ridin they say, "What's that?"
...A fancy car
Or a big tit, I hang with the stars
{overlapping first line of chours} I got money

[Hook]

[Dolla Boy]
Life as a trap star, switched to a rap star
Livin on the fast lane, like I'm in a NASCAR
Switched up the game on 'em, keep it in the carry-on
Out of state travelin, traffickin
Travelin to Golden Isle, fuckin wit the Africans
Two G's less what averagin, averagin
Don't blame me baby, I'm just my daddy's son
Know when he shot off, didn't think that I'll be shot out
Or show-off who show out and showboat when hoes out
Who know bout them knowbouts, once in ain't no outs
My buddy had the block lockdown, it was his
Now he in the cellblock lock doin ten
It's bad for the biz, but still we gotta get cheese
Butchu don't care about that, you just care about me
You don't wanna hold dough, you just wanna hold me
But shawty when you hold me, you hold me for me
It cain't be cause...

[Hook]

[Dolla Boy]
It's all about the riches, nuttin else
You want it, go get it, strive for the best
I drink from the top shelf, flights in the first class
Hunnid on the freeway, hope a nigga don't craaaash
Cause if I might, I'm gon miss my play comin thew' tonight
Twenty-fo' for them hoes, fangs hope they bite
But, in spite, we love life

[Tity Boi]
Started from the bottom on the way to the top
From ashy, to classy, to flashy
Money is my motivation that moves ME
I feel GOOD, I'm just tryna do me!
And if thangs right tonight, I might do three
Cause last night, I did two, who?
Sanaa Lathan, Gabrielle Union
I'm just foolin; I paid my dues and I live like the movies

[Hook]

"Niggers act, like they cain't see what another nigga been through
And don't give 'em no credit for surviving his battles
But I say, 'Fuck 'em - look at me now bitches!'"[Intro: Ving Rhames]
He's a hustler, unbound by law
A self-made, millionaire
With a wreckless disregard, for the haters

He expanded his empire into multiple profitable businesses
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits

And my favorite, MyGhetto.com
The MVP, of this rap shit

[Ludacris]
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer
I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)
Spit 30 large for cigars of you ho niggas (oww!)
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you, into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the "Port of Miami"
To keepin it "Trilla"
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
He's worth eight figures
So young niggas, boss up
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss

[Rick Ross]
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said "We were hustlers"
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillrs
Frontin at awards, real street niggas
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass
Big ass face, chop you in your laugh face
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim

[Interlude: Ving Rhames]
Hailing from College Park, Georgia
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob
Or illegal organization
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week
Selling mid-grade, they were some high-rollin hustlers

[Tity Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support strippers
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)
(White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow)
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late
Ain't no such thing as second place
(And every day I live heavyweight, you niggas featherweight)
(Fairytale tellin niggas really need to take a break)
And the estate got a lake for a backyard
(The pool room product put it all on my sacks card)
For real? (Yeah, for real)
I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will
(I got dogs like Cujo, me and Tity two chains ridin in a two do')
Bitches catch kudos (you know)
Yeah we move weight like sumos
And kicks it with them bitches like judo
SOUTHSIDE!

Stupid bankroll

Anythang goes

Shorty your car too small, have to stoop in it
Stupid kicks
I got a stupid wrist
Duffle Bag Boys, a.k.a. the Stupid Clique
Stupid this
Stupid that
Smokin' on that strong, call it a stupid pack
And this a stupid summer
And I'm stupid stuntin'
The way I move weight, call me Ruben Studdard
One stupid man
Two stupid chains
Three for the dope
Four for the brain
And she got stupid brain
I mean, stupid brain!
I took her to the mall
And bought her everythang

I bought her stupid Louis
Everytime you see me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Oj Da Juiceman]
Stupid cars, stupid hoes
Damn I'm livin' stupid, dawg
VVS diamonds same color London fog
London fog? Hell yeah! Your bitch say she swallow balls
Pinky ring stupid big like I play some basketball
Football in the street
Hell naw, I'm in the street
Stupid color chain, diamonds look like Tweety tweet
Pull up to the club and the coupe on them Shaq feet
Trap goin' ham, bricks runnin' like a track meet
Young Juiceman and that stupid just attract me
Bouldercrest workin' and my motors in the back seat
Sun Valley workin' and my motors in the back seat
Tity, Juice and Dolla: all we do is stack cheese

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
Came from the block where I used to be the middleman
Now I'm on the late flight, catch me in the business class
Niggas talkin' that bullshit? You better handle your business, fam
Hit 'em with the semis and
Never leave no witnesses
We don't need no witnesses
All about them dividends
Last nigga who tried me? You can't ask me what I did for him
Thousand grams of hard got my country boys comin' in
Hope they buy it all; if not, what I'm gon' do with this?
Duffle Bag, ho
Everything counts
We stay gettin' money
What the fuck are you about?
They know we got that stupid clout
Southside don't do a drought
I-16 with them things, I got a stupid route

[Hook][Hook: Shawn Jay/ Tity Boi (2 Chainz)]
This the hardest beat I ever heard
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
You see them 24's on the curb
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
You see them big blunts full of purp
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
Everything I got I worked for
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit

[Verse 1: Shawn Jay]
Shawn Jay the type to break a ho, young chasin major dough
Cut the check with DTP, now chickens try and play me close
Ballin in the mall with Chaka, shoppin for the latest clothes
Turn your lady to a bopper, watch how I take your ho
Niggas see I get that money, now they wanna wait to blow
Underground grindin, perfect timing in a crazy flow
Put Georgia on your mind and now I'm ridin on the radio
Your ass ain't no DJ, my advise stop playin me folk

[Verse 2: Smoke]
I'm ridin in my drop cut, these 24 inch not scrubbin
In my plastic sack, I got more purple than Baby Bops buddy
So materialistic, we're chopping early today
What rolls around my throat, arm wristed in a bouqet
15's in the back blasting, Peep the candy as I pass em
Watch the chamillion paint flop, like Chingy's last album
Cocoa Chanelle frames, on woodgrain
Old grain blown thangs on my hip, but that's the clips

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
I'm married to the streets and this beef shit's apart of it
Jumped out with heat, niggas didn't want no parts of it
Pull up in the club, looking like they wanna start something
Fuckin all these niggas hoes, that ain't ever dawned on me
Tired of the fussin, bitches blushin, bumrushin
The car treat me like a star but I ain't done nuttin
Summer almost over with but I ain't done frontin
They hate we gettin money, we gon make these niggas love it

[Verse 4: Tity Boi (2 Chainz)]
Pay my dues, takin crews, just me and my haitian dudes
Makin loot, even made the news in my gator shoes
Three fifty seven Glock, nine, a tech twenty two
Everything I ride in on at least twenty twos
This hustler music is what you hear in them drug zones
They play it in their chevy loud plus it's a club song
That's seven fourty five, that's my whip
The biggest house in the neighborhood, that's my shit

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Perfect Harmony]
I get high like cooley, ruling with the toolin
On a 22, still got that uzi in that hoopty
Niggas all flashy, showing off their jewelry
Til I shoot it through their heart like cupid
Give it to 'em raw like sushi, then I'm back on the groupies
Young nigga with a gun nigga, Norfclik where I'm from nigga
Shut up and roll that blunt nigga and I don't even stunt nigga
Quiet cause I hit them lips, roll up on a nigga with a clip now that's my shit

[Verse 5: Ludacris]
I may be rich but never satisfied, making hoes camera shy
Comin down topping blades, call me The Last Samurai
I'll cut cha, gun butt cha, Knuck ya then buck ya
It calls for Hammer Time if you think we can't touch ya
Cause we too legit to quit, nigga run up on your click nigga
Not action heroes but we all making six figures
So put your choice to it, women get moist to it
A songs worth a million once I lend my fucking voice to it

[Hook]Yeah.. we gon' send this one out
To e'rybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
Let's ride

[Hook]
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you {*repeat 3X*}
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flo' and let's roll!

[Ludacris]
Yess; Seven cars, eight cribs, and ain't a damn thang changed
Still pumpin' ten kickers, still grippin' the grain
Still candy in the paint, still ridin' them thangs
Most of my folks would same I'm happy, but I still feel pain
Until I jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobiles got these neighbors screaming "Gimme a break!"
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cuz I can't hold my five hundred horses
Lamborginis and Porches, Ferraris and Vipers
I'mm wipe the seats wit' you drool, and rub the hood wit a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap yout seatbelts on, go put ya money up
Go put your life on the line, go put ya honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
It's time to play, or better yet brand out the toys; we goin'

[Hook]

[Dolla Boy]
I'm in a SS Super Sport, with the Four Fifty Four
.45th on the seat, don't get yourself supersoaked
Dependin' on the weather, it may vary - whatever though
Catch me slammin' Escalade, Cadillac, to Chevy do's
And hope I don't, and pull out the Range Rover
The color of coke and snow, I blew out the brains on ya
Blew out the game on em', became a misfit
Shame on a nigga, the 726s wouldn't fit
I'm ridin', I'm high, and I'm glidin, I'm lyin'
I'm flyin', I'm doin 190, it's gon cost to catch us
You see that these diamonds are shinin', and blingin'
And blindin', so let me remind ya it's gon cost to catch up
Who's next up? - That's us, flow leave you breathless
Pedal to the flo', truck seat won't let up
But if you out ridin' deuces or better
Slow down so them girls can't sweat ya, and let the car go

[Hook]

[Bridge 4X: Titi Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Assign your name in the skreet (sign your name in the skreet)

[Tity Boi]
I got two miles an hour, so everbody see me
Twenty fours, twenty sixes, twenty eights!
And my rims so big, you would think that is was 3D
Wait' til you see my paint, I ride around the A
With 'bout half a tank; I'm startin' to make so much money
I work half a day - I got cash in the safe
I got cash right here, I'm hard to get my swipe on
And I look like a chandalleur with all this ice on
Pull out the (?) shoot
Catch me blowin' out kush of the roof of the seven deuce
Ridin' hella hoes (hella!) elevador do's (hella)
Gator on the seat (And?) mink on the flo's
If a hater wanna creep, I got that thing by the do'
And if my chirp go beep, then my thang gon' blow
Playaz Circle - Titi Boi ridin' on skinny wheels
Bout to trade in the Quarter til eight, and get the ten till

[Hook] - repeat 2X[Verse 1: Dolla Boy]
Ain't sitting around in yo top back
All I'm trying to do is make a dollar don't accomplish that
Probably both, call the hoes
See if she can meet me up at Pompadors
Table in the front so I can see who's in and out the door
We ain't gotta front cause we've been making lots of dough
We ain't taking fronts unless you bringing in a lot of dough
Probably if Jaquari was just starving I'd be robbing folks
Frontin in ?? and it can leave you in the hospital
Came a long way but we still got some miles to go
Cowards gonna despise us, but the real niggas like us though
Sorry my rival put a stop to your theatricals
The streets want the real and honored that we happy for them
And then you realize everything come and it goes
I'm tryin get before it comes and it goes

[Hook: Tity Boi (aka 2 Chainz)]
Diamonds on my wrist, ladies in the building
If you feeling sexy put your drinks to the ceiling
Yaaa, do it like them playaz do
And we on them drugs we goin' be here for a day or two

[Verse 2: Tity Boi (aka 2 Chainz)]
?? county tags blowing smoke out the roof
Tell your man he's a fag and I'm the motherfucking truth (I'm the truth)
See I don't like to brag but he's the proof
The trunk bigger than your future, I'm too tall for a coupe (For a coupe)
And this is something that I'd rather do
Flip the script cover my tattoos Armani is the suit
Mari is the shoes, VS is the juice and the necklace is fruits see the rest of my dudes
Got on vest and the True's
On yo best day I move
Like a man on the moon
Gotta expand it and move it
We land it and cruise
Got plans before truants
Spend grands on the cruise to put a tan on my bruises
And this is how we do it, straight shots with no chasers
And every round I'm making toasts to show off my bracelet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludachris]
My bank accounts are impatient and they, they can't wait
So I'm never a dollar short, or a, a day late
I smoke the best for the stress just to, to stay straight
The bud's light is less filling, but it, it tastes great
I keep the cash in the stash from the, the po po
Cause they say it won't hurt them, what they, they don't know
Though i roll in the coupe that hugs the whole block
Don't play I'm still hood, you'll still get cold cocked
The four will sure pop
Your soul will sure drop
Fours will get blown but i sure do hope not, I'm hot
But I ain't tripping on these young whipper snappers
I'm trying to get a chick up in my whip and get her snapper
Put her on her stomach get back and then slap her
Take her to her home and be gone the morning after

[Hook][Tity Boi]
My shades on in the club
And I'm hollering "What it do?"
I'm all of the above!
High and some Gin and Juice
Nigga I will spit at you and you and you
I am drunk
I am on that you don't wanna do it fluid
What?
I got a bank roll size of a phone book!
And it got me walking around slow foot
Supply & Demand
I am the man
You want it? We got it!
Pocket full of rubberbands!

[Dolla Boy]
I think the odds are-
High in favor vote for our side, outside
Galo on shoes
They not our size!
Ride high!
Keep big shoes up on my ride
Stay fly!
Keep it tuned up on my side
I rock the best
So they shop, is my shop!
Cause my rock's the best
When they stop, we don't
Cause my Glock's compressed
So may I suggest?
Invest in some Tec's and some K's and some Vest's

[Hook]
[Dolla Boy]
I got the scale in the car

A monster
Best of the hustlers, I do numbers!
Number, one of the ones who won't run up
I'm one up
To and I'm crusin' to Columbia
To meet a new connect
And let them see the check
Then let 'em see the tec
To know it ain't no fucking us
They love how we running up
Back and forth running back, quarterback
Common place, whole game intact!

[Tity Boi]
That D boy shit!
High talk products

Every Impala's on beat that slick and

Rest I tape it 'round the hip
And I'm flying down the street

And we Weigh it or we leave

[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
It's Tity Boi, you know my demeanor
24 inches on the Beamer, mine cleaner
Had a baby daddy saying man have you seen her
And the nigga saying "yeah she with the nigga with the Beamer
ATL finest, south side behind this
My new nickname is Your Highness I'm the flyest
I'm the brightest, I got the Midas touch
Anything I touch I can bundle up and double up
Switch lanes calm as fuck
I ride around with money like an armored truck
Wells Fargo, where's Harbo?
Color purple, move weight like cargo
And yeah I need cheese like nacho
ASAP, pronto, this feeling is winning
Cinco de Mayo, my connect just chilling
But every other day I swear just like Christmas
We got bags like Santa Claus, keys like piano, dawg
When Hard came out he came out Muslim
When Gold came out man, he came out jookin
The life we chose hoes, clothes, dope, doe
That's all a nigga know, yep


[Hook]
Yeah we getting rich bitch

[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Can't be fucking with you niggas while I'm dealing with these bricks
That's the same shit that broke Michael Vick
Shit happens, pick your best rapper in a battle
Don't know enough
Don't play with kids come back when you grown up
Grown man shit, this is not Nickelodeon
You wanna see a trick I can show you where I'm holdin em
Trapper of the Year, the connect call me
Say the pack in the air I got the check on me
You boys been phoney talking bout what you holding
Niggas bullshitting rapping boy, keep at least 2 on me
Twin like fish in the suits saying who want em
Trying to switch the page, today the coupes grey
Tomorrow then it's beige, the next day it's orange
While I'm sparring back and forth with a bitch that's foreign
Taking off the glasses, smoking weed and laughing
Time for some action, face in my lap bitch
Just like Tit said
I think about money I got chickens on my head and your bitch in my bed


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Disturbing tha Peace
Luda!
Listen
How else can I explain it?
Young, black and famous
I shit dollar bills, I get money out the anus
I own 12 houses, niggas still paying rent
I tipped the maid 5 stacks and I ain't seen the bitch since
Too much money, I don't know how to act with it
So I ride around up in my 93 Ac with it
Like it never happened, like I'm undercover
Like women still licking my dick when I was Chris Lova
What the fuck, death to you haters
I wear black everyday like I shop with Darth Vader
Keep the Luke Skywalker force is the chopper
Furry mink coat straight looking like Chewbacca
You can't stop us, even if you tried
Closet looking like some gaters just crawled in and died
And we have gathered here today for the mulah
Rich niggas, Dolla Boy, Tity Boi, Luda!

Pretty Much The Same As A Child The Pain I Mean
Producking my environment was kane to me
Producking my environment why you blaming me?

KING SHIT KING SHIT

(Chorus)
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly

God Knows I wasn't ready for this one
God Knows I wasn't Ready To miss ya
From The Cracks Of Concrete comes the rodes we started out
On the Concrete where crack and we rose far
We let things coming up I suppose
What drove us to dream and pack things in our clothes
Tell that pops was a fiend and I know
Told Mama I don't want to be that please don't let me be that
She cried and said baby be strong they wrong mama cuz you raised a man on yo own
I love that pops came around though he said he had to let the streets raise me I ain't mad look how the streets raise me
All the game that the streets gave me
It's up to me we gon eat baby
I miss mike and the way it used to be maybe
That's the reason that I beast on these beats lately
I know you still with me

I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly

I woke up on the wrong side of the sofa
Eatin most of rollacoastas rollin ova
Son of an act mom was a soldier slightly embarrassed about how i growed up see pop wasn't around when he was around he was slanging pounds and him and mom fight in the middle of the night
I saw one strike a woman that I love her woman that I like
Never In My life expressed even a wife

So right here at this moment right here
Right hand on my heart swears coming from my heart
Steering through the trenches I ain't even trying to stop
I'm trying take it straight to the top
I'm trying to places where it's hot in the winter
Remember Cereal for breakfast cereal for dinner
And what makes it special that I ain't even tripping you raised you a man with quickness against all odds

I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly

(lil Wayne):

Yeah and every time I see the sun shine
I drop down a give thanks at least one time
Feeling like I'm living on the front line
I'm Feeling like every second is crush time
I've had breakfast will I make to lunch time
And I ain't joking so don't be looking for a punchline
Will I be the next victim of a gun crime I don't know the answer that why I brung mine
Riding by myself late at night pistol on my lap at every single red light
Yeah I made my bed rights so when I do I should sleep tight and peace I RIP
Before I sleep I pray to the lord my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake I pray to the lord my souls I've taken for goodness sake

I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
Cuz I've been loved and when the day come that I get judged
Believe me baby I won't budge baby I won't budge
I've been hurt but I don't hold no grudge
At least I can say I was loved
And Then We Live And Then We Die
Sometimes we fall and then we fly Lord let me fly(feat. Phonte (of Little Brother) )

[Chorus: Phonte]
I got money, lots of jewels and fancy cars
(They say I'm wrong) But, baby don't blame me
I'm just a paper chaser
Paid my dues and now I cruise with movie stars
(They say I'm wrong) But, baby don't blame me
I'm just a paper chaser

[Tity Boi:]
They wanna know where my name from, where I came from
Where I Florian Champagne dunn
Arm & Hammer grammar, campaign on it
Propane slang, put the flame on it
I was so hungry, I could eat a house
Then shit it out, til I figured out a different route
I'm tryna get clout, cash and a Black card
So now even my pool got a backyard
Now it's time to fast-forward, speed up the process
I'm so fresh, I could fuck her off my outfit
Ridin in the cockpit, ridin with the top back
Ridin on some butt-nicks, ridin they say, "What's that? "
... A fancy car
Or a big tit, I hang with the stars

[overlapping first line of Chorus] I got money

[Chorus]
[Dolla Boy:]
Life as a trap star, switched to a rap star
Livin on the fast lane, like I'm in a NASCAR
Switched up the game on 'em, keep it in the carry-on
Out of state travelin, traffickin
Travelin to Golden Isle, fuckin with the Africans
Two G's less what averagin, averagin
Don't blame me baby, I'm just my daddy's son
Know when he shot off, didn't think that I'll be shot out
Or show-off who show out and showboat when hoes out
Who know bout them knowbouts, once in ain't no outs
My buddy had the block lockdown, it was his
Now he in the cellblock lock doin ten
It's bad for the biz, but still we gotta get cheese
Butchu don't care about that, you just care about me
You don't wanna hold dough, you just wanna hold me
But shawty when you hold me, you hold me for me
It cain't be cause...

[Chorus]
[Dolla Boy:]
It's all about the riches, nuttin else
You want it, go get it, strive for the best
I drink from the top shelf, flights in the first class
Hunnid on the freeway, hope a nigga don't craaaash
Cause if I might, I'm gon miss my play comin thew' tonight
Twenty-fo' for them hoes, fangs hope they bite
But, in spite, we love life

[Tity Boi:]
Started from the bottom on the way to the top
From ashy, to classy, to flashy
Money is my motivation that moves ME
I feel GOOD, I'm just tryna do me!
And if thangs right tonight, I might do three
Cause last night, I did two, who?
Sanaa Lathan, Gabrielle Union
I'm just foolin; I paid my dues and I live like the movies

[Chorus]
[computer woman voice:]
"Niggers act, like they cain't see what another nigga been through
And don't give 'em no credit for surviving his battles
But I say, 'Fuck 'em – look at me now bitches! '"
