[Verse 1: KB]
Yeah, K to the second letter
How you want to do it homie?
I'm all up in it, down to the bone I feel it
Coming and breaking it down with that wiggity wiggity style
Man we really be living it out on mission
Flow God, no lie, oh yeah
We bust rhymes, one ride, no stops
Take 'em to show dog, see the most high, so high
Leave 'em so shocked frozen face like botox
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no stars up in this tour
See, the stars that my dogs love to applaud
Are the faithful saints that endure
You could never stop em'
You got a better chance winning the Tour de France
With no legs against Lance
Or seeing Mr. Edward Scissorhands
On Instagram taking a selfie
Your hell freeze before I'm ashamed off in my LP

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
All them really wanna come see
This beat 1-3-1-3
Get ape when I speak
Imma say my piece
Throw the peace sign with some boatload of truth if you can’t see
Yeah buddy, rollin' so deep it ain't funny
My beliefs on the back of that money
And I promise I ain't frontin'
I’m just tryna jump up on the track and let 'em know I run it
Yeah buddy, uptown be the place I put on for
Faith got me living risky like I’m going for it on 4th & 11
I ain't talking bout' them Concords, do you want more?
Blake in the paint imma' bang for the cause
Unashamed be the lifestyle more then them tours
Oh Lord he coming back like an encore
If ya' don't know now ya' know boy

[Pre-Hook]
They ain't even know we was out here
They gonna find out what we ‘bout here
Cause everyday we turn up (all day!)
Yeah lights out cause the sun up (i know you see)

[Hook]
And now they know, Now they know
Say now they know, Now they know
Now they know, Now they know
Now they knooooww
Now they know, Now they know (x3)
Now they knooooww yeahhh

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I’m done with hiding
We won’t be denied no more
Now they know
Always on my job
Y'all better check my resume
Numb to all the nonsense
Let’s just call that novocaine
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so RMG
Light of the world when you look at me
Perfecting my King like he made me, never caged me like
Like Cujo, I'm off the le-le-leash
We gon' find the proof it don’t matter who you asking
Ra ra ra ra like a dungeon dragon
Doom doom doom hear the bass beat blastin'
All up in your face, unashamed for the masses

[Verse 4: Tedashii]
Woo! I heard they needed to know my whole crew spittin' truth
Yeah you needed it though
Hold up
Can't keep it closed, that's cruel, it be cold, like the heat was low
Hold up
Yeah this is it, your time baby get up and show ‘em you with us
What burn at the core, like when you doin' sit ups
Unashamed, that's the message that we give 'em
I live it (woo!) til the day that I’m finished
Copy what he did and I’m still authentic, winning (woo!)
H-town my city, put it in the air let me know that you with it
Like mayne, hold up, unashamed with my gang I told ya
My aim, no bane, no soap bruh
In pain, my game, his hope cuz

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
U-N-A-S-H-A-M-E-D we be goin' in
Recognize a real squad when you see mine
Don’t it seem odd that we live our lives to please God
Press pause on a raw explicit (now you tripping)
Unashamed of the truth but unafraid to live it
Still afraid of the leaven though I see my dough rise
One of those guys actin' like nobody know God like I do
Speak my piece, keep my peace
So I ain't gotta keep my piece, capisce?
Click thick like a chain, try to take a link up out it
We ain't unashamed just because we rap about it, nah
We unashamed ‘cause we live it
I'm throwing up the real so they probably catching feelings
Give it away, give it away now, now nah that ain't it
I don't feel them till I hear them holla 116

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook][Hook]
This body's not mine it's yours it's yours it's yours
So everyday I'm fighting a war
To flee from it all till I'm free from it all (2x)

[Verse 1: KB]
Ok saved at an early age
In thirty days, it felt like I had managed to murdered most of my worldly ways
Worldly ways? But a couple stayed and coupled with a couple years
I'm wondering am I had missed out on the thrills I had thrown away
Was all this in vain? Strain to remain and refrain
And sustain through this flame in my veins
Lust is his name, this virgin a burden
I ain't never hit the club maybe I just need a taste
A lil' taste, a lil' taste is like a little rape
A lil' drank, a poison but can it kill a mayne?
A heard them say without sex life is a waste
But Christ is over all I kept my pants on my waste
Turned beautiful chicks away, dudes swearin' that I'm lame
Though I got a sex drive the Spirit's holding the brakes
There's no breaks this is His infinite work
Content with my rib nothing is sweet enough to desert her

[Interlude]
See some of y'all done bought the lie
That sex is what makes you a man
But that's not what makes you a man
Anybody can go lay with a woman
What makes you a man is being defined
By who you say you are in Christ
If you have Christ you have all that you need
Everything you need is bound up in the resurrected Savior

[Verse 2: PRo]
Look can I be real with you
They say that women want attention that's the real issue
And if they only wore dresses just a little bit longer
Then the flesh that I be feeding wouldn't burn like a sauna
Wait is that the reason why your brain is in chains?
When you at home by yourself in front of computer screens
Or is that the reason why sick men prey on
Little girls in school still playing with crayons
No! It's the flesh that all men should fight
While Satan persist to tempt us with our own wicked delights
See God made intimacy to glorify He
The flesh wanna do as we please glorify we
That girl is not an object for playing
That's a woman not a barbie I don't care what Nicki say
And just like her sex is God's creation
You spit inside his face when you don't use it how he made it

[Interlude]
Sex is a gift from God but we've taken it and made it idolatry
We've taken it and put it in the place of God
And we worship it and so it comes out in all kinds of profane ways
And so we blame the women for what they're wearing
And we blame the media for what they're producing
But we never blame ourselves
For how we've twisted God's gift to glorify us

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Flesh on the rise like the tide when I go surfing
You can see just what I prize in my life when I go searching
Roaming with my eyes; no surprise sin is lurking
Get's me every time and inside man I'm hurting
Pretending that I'm fine but it's a lie man I'm burdened
Cause what's inside is never satisfied so I serve it
Afraid of getting caught so I hide I'm so nervous
Scared that I may die begging Christ to reverse it
Lord you are the gospel such a bad scene
Even if I clear my history my past ain't clean
And I can try clean it up but it never seems enough
I trust myself then hurt myself fail this is tough
I need the gospel clear see my sin for what it is
One brings life the other death man to me plus my kids
Selfish in my ways and it's go'n put me in the grave
But Christ can save and set you free no longer be enslaved

[Bridge]
My spirit willing but my flesh weak
This moment is but a test see
Lord you're greater than all these pleasures
I just wanna see you as my treasure
God I wanna
Flee from it all till I'm free from it all (4x)

[Interlude]
Manning up is not just managing your sexual temptations
It's not just managing your sin that's not what it means to be a man
Because you can try harder and you can do better
And you can hang on longer that's not manning up
Manning up is our ability to lay down all of our effort
And all of our trying and all of our strength and say I trust in Jesus
I trust in his perfection I trust in his power I trust in his ressurection
Because he's the only one that can get me through this
And he's the only one that can make me free[Verse 1]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Ya'll gon' get me bowed up
When that beat hit it's like three kicks in
Yo' knees up to yo' nose, huh
You knows us
Unashamed, Uno Uno Seis, whoa
Tatted on my skin, all up in yo' face, whoa
If I ain't bout that live, then I ain't really livin'
But if you can't see my light then maybe I ain't in it
Champagne, champagne, celebratin' my campaign
I just dug a well in West Africa
But how many of my friends is African, huh?
No habla español, just show me tu baño
Ain't tryna get to know you, I'm too busy readin' Daniel
Most segregated time of day is Sunday service (My Lord)
Now what you think that say about the God you worship?
First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gon change the world
There's no way
It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gon' last more than one day
What you thought, huh?
Faith ain't 'bout no soft stuff
I heard you just went overseas, now come back home and boss up

[Hook]
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water, dirty water
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water
Ain't no filters in this town, dirty water

[Verse 2]
Worthless, worthless, 400 years we done heard that
My family came here on slave ships
Some herd cattle, some herd blacks
Know some of ya'll done heard that
My kin was treated less than men
That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin
Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize
I must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by
They must be whores cause the master rapes them
And leaves the child
So dead beat daddy was taught to me way before my time
Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains
Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved
Put 'em round your neck, cuz we still hangin'
Hood preacher told 'em they should live as kings
You call him devil, he fightin for self esteem (think about it)
It's hard to dream when your water ain't clean
Now look at Lucifer's scheme as how to be in a team
Blood in the ocean to these African streams
This dirty water ain't nothin we haven't seen

[Hook][Hook: KB]
Look up in the sky, ohh I made it
Think I'm gonna lie when I tell you I ain't gon take it
I got hands on nations, check my reputation
Yeah that scoreboard still 1-0 cause my tomb is vacant
That's why I'm... Undefeated
I'm Undefeated
Turn up
Undefeated

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Who do you think that you are?
When I tell y'all that I run things
Y'all better believe me
Spin the earth on my finger like round ball
I'm a globetrotter, its easy
No lie boy y'all got me messed up
Not Buddha, Muhammad and I dang sure ain’t no Yeezus (at all)
Y'all all like I ain't made where you standing
Y'all act like I ain't drown the whole planet
Act like my son ain't died on the cross
Or I ain't gave you my all look here I ain't taking no loss
I love you with all my heart that's the reason I'm here with my hands up giving my grace
I know that you know that I'm here ignore if you want but the next time you spit in my face
You better just


[Hook: KB]


[Verse 2: KB]
Undisputed no mistakes or plan B
In the end you’ll all marvel like its Stan lee
Don't doubt me but know about me
It don't look like I'm in the lead
But your ignorance don't make you safe
Because the worst punch is the one you don't see
Till you don't see I ain't done yet
Watch all the glory my son gets
The whole world been set up
But you backwards, you upset
I was the one that put man on this planet
But im manning the planets
And planet by planet im planning out history spoiler alert
I get the victory over your habitat
Matter fact matters a matter act to my exact
If you like it then you should put a ring on it, I told Saturn that

[Hook: KB]

[Outro: KB, Derek Minor & Gawvi]
(Never lost no)
No death (never lost no)
No natural disaster (Never lost boy no never ever lost boy)
No new philosophy
Nothing in the past (My people never lose boy never ever lose boy)
No demon
No disease (Never ever lose boy because I never lose boy never ever lose boy)
Always and forever I'm undefeated
Handle it, can you handle it?
I managed the world's  mismanagements
Thousands of years of the worst things (the earth’s curse)
And it hurts me but I got purposes in the hurts of men
If you don’t know it now, you’ll know it then
There’s a greater good, don’t worry friend
Where my glory goes, it reverses it
Amen
Amen[Hook]
Who you know shining in these streets like a light mane
Who you know stay the same Sunday to Sunday
Who you know taking off on tracks like a runway
Who you know beat the odds even when they say he can’t

Who you know
Who you know
Who you know, ah (x4)

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Who you know that hop on tracks
And act like he done lost his mind
Who you know that love The Lord
And ain’t gone trip if you don’t like
Who you know that’s RMG but unashamed until he die
Who you know that talk bout God
And still out rap your trappest guy
Who do you know that could care less
About how much money you making
Cause that don’t impress him
Who do you know that know he ain’t supposed to be here
So tomorrow he counting his blessings
Who do you know that’s gone
Steer clear of people that stay in some drama
Cause they looking messy
Who do you know gone keep real in the message

Who you know (x4)

[Bridge]
People gone say that I’m crazy
I stepped out on my own, on a plane with no parachute
Turbulence it will not phase me
Float right over problems inside my hot air balloon
You know what I been on (know what I been on)
That ain’t gone change whether suburb or ghetto
Faith what I live on (faith what I live on)
Full speed ahead boy it’s pedal to metal now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I hear a whole lot of talking. Sit back and listen
Why you make so many assumptions (so many assumptions)
Soon as they hear that you Christian
Like bet that he all about money
I bet he only rock gators and suits on a Sunday
I bet that he think that he perfect
I don’t see nothing but hypocrites all in them churches
Yall lying. Holla at Canon. You’ll see that he is who he say he is
Tone or Chad Jones
You gone see fathers that’s off in they home and they living it
Deraj and B Coop, bout dat life
Lecrae 116 bout dat life
You think this way more than music, hwah, you guessed it you right
I wrote this for every person, know that we not perfect
But through Jesus purchase, we gone keep on working
Fakin we allergic, on our grind till the wheels, wheels, wheels fall off (till the wheels fall off)
Its all about Jesus. He got a people that He been redeeming
The world is so tired of the fake so they look for the real they ask you these questions like

[Hook][Intro]
Party People
Lose Your Mind
We gon Party All Night

Hey Marty!
This is my Social Club ad lib
Supposed to say something random and funny right here

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night
I stage dive off the top rope like Macho Man
If I hit your mama with an elbow then I'm sorry fam
Ya'll better know it
Misfits and Minor are lions and tigers
In other words, animals, animals, animals
We all going crazy I think you should try now (you, you, you)
Hands to the sky like I'm flapping the Giant
Controlling the crowd like ventriloquist
Many resurrecting if you not feeling this
Party just beginning we are not ending it
People say I'm crazy, I'm not feeling it now

[Hook]
Lose your mind
We gon Party All Night
You tell your crew I tell my crew, We party all night!

[Verse 2: MartyMar]
Agh! Oh no they back again
Hoppin out of Minivans
With couple of their friends
Still rocking Hammer pants
I could do that Hammer dance
Just gimme room though
I'm singing this Spanish
Girls they think I'm in Menudo
I'm drinking Martin in the back and my shirt is mustard
Politicking on the patio my shirt up button
I tell that people about Jesus over tea and crumpets
We too busy having fun and you busy doing nothing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: FERN]
What the problem is y'all try to play us like Optimus
When we currently in our prime like Optimus
Promoters hit the email like lock us in
We're booked to next year that's a lot of gigs
And a couple of them with Derek and his rapper friends
Canon, B-Coop and not to mention them
But not many other artists that I recommend
Lately I been thinking it was dirty for the culture
Chilling me and stash money dancing in the corner
Twerking out work it out baby feeding over donor
Instagram fill got you feeling like a baller
I do things more stiffer than most you
My raps like a slam dunk tryna post you
Verse like this make this like you supposed to do
Now party all night like we told you to

[Hook][Intro]
Time is the fourth dimension
And a measure in which events can ordered
From the past, through the present, into the future
All signify that we are all bound to time

[Hook: Derek Minor]
I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be
I be on this here until you bury me
Buildin' His empire that never die
I bet He'll be here till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Grindin', workin', hustlin' on this mission, I will never quit
Every single track you put in front of me I'm killin' it
Not for money, fame, attention, this is what I'm gettin at
Christ the King and this His empire, He don't deserve no less than that
I'm a be snappin' on tracks you should know if you get in my way that I never let up
There's some people that need to hear truth they get beat down by lies and get told that they'll never get up
Few of 'em might even pull out their strap and go yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak with the gun
I'm a tell 'em that God He want all of your pain
And I'm prayin that one day you feel all of his love
That's all I know, straight live by that
And I'm 'bout that life, I die by that
Believe what I say, we are not goin' away, this is the work of the Lord
Grindin' for all of my days, ain't no more play, this what He makin' me for, I'm gone

[Hook: Derek Minor]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Still wearin' church clothes, loafin' in my pennies boy
Talkin' out they neck about me, lookin' silly boy
Hallowed be Thy name, bless all these shallow souls
I'm focused on forever, don't know what tomorrow holds
Wanna go to war with God? You ain't gon' make it
Makin' them arrogant statements, talk about money you makin'
We know you fakin', we know your whole reputation
And if the shoe fits you better tie your shoe laces
He is so patient with these rebel nations, embracin' they hatred
I would've burned the whole world for insubordination
Yeah, but until the end of time
His grace is sweeter than wine, your god ain't greater than mine, boy

[Hook: Derek Minor]

[Verse 3: Canon]
Ok, forever bruh, that's a long time, and gettin' in this game, that's a long line
But I cut through with my Kung Fu, go Jackie Chan on my first rhyme
Cuz I kicks it, Bruce Lee cousin, if I'm on the track that must mean somethin'
Them sixteens that go click bang, when that subwoofer start mean muggin'
My team jumpin', been about that life, look at here, you ain't close to the top height
Lookin' for the proof, they should come up with a name of 'em lookin' like they coming for the kill on the mic
Yikes, sniper tracks in tongue of these artists, such a pro I'm cunning these hoarders
I'm havin' 'em thinkin' they ill, till' the cab that I put 'em on, vocal I'm just gettin' started
We go zero to a hundred in that lane, comin' and runnin' and gunnin' what I gain
I pop pop, I'm a semi-automatic, get naked for the server, coming to cut 'em with them lyrics
Been cliqued up, my clique get busted, yeah they shook harder They fallin' like a piñata, like super-sweet
I'm exposin' 'em, lookin' inside of 'em, show 'em that nothin' gon' last but the truth in me
Now friend and enemy done dropped to their knees, hail to the Son of God, he drop drop to the King
King, nothing impossible,  look at that Paul the apostle that carried the dream
Dream like Martin the King, make head to the man of the legend, who he?
God is the Alpha Omega, Beginning and End, and the Lamb and the Shepherd of Sheep

[Outro: Derek Minor]
I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be
Till the end of time
I be on this here until you bury me
Till the end of time
Till the end of time[Hook: K-Drama]
Opposition in my face, trying to play defense
I’m bigger than this dude, this don’t make no sense
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em
I Air Jordan on ‘em

[Verse 1: Thi’sl]
They don’t want it Drama, I bang on these clowns
Slam some truth so heavy on ‘em that it crack the ground
Then bring the rim down, we not backin’ down
When the smoke clears, we standin’, they’re still lookin’ ‘round
The coach done put me in the game so I’m about to clown
When my game off, I got a team to hold me down
Throw your boy J’s all black on ‘em
I’m too big to be Michael so I’ll go Shaq on ‘em

[Verse 2: Json]
See I was weak and feeble, the Holy Ghost he gave me the power forward
And hit the block, posted up like I’m a power forward
And I ain’t backin’ down, I’m refusing to budge
The enemy be tempting me, I ain’t moving a nudge
The Risen Savior took my behavior to the grave with him
Yep I had to die, and Air Jordan when I’m raised with him
Heard what I said, fam?
So tell me how it feels, you’ve been listening to a dead man

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Young Josh]
I Air Jordan on ‘em, they may try to block me
But I push that Rock so can’t nobody stop me
With they trash talk, they try to trip me up
Since I been fixed I’ve been rollin’, I fall he’ll pick me up
My whole team gifted, diverse but unified
Triangle offense homie, Truine, my crew is fly
My Coach draws the plays, yo I just follow through
Playin’ my part straight from the heart, opposition ain’t got a clue

[Verse 4: J. Johnson]
Full court press on, good with the rock, CP
Satan got the box on one on, but he can’t hold me
I give him 33, double that, 66
All in the Hall of Fame stuntin’, shinin’, taking flicks
You think it’s 1 on 5, don’t know I ball with God
Swagger is Jordanesque, didn’t know I could fly
I smell victory when defeat is cookin’
Like Spike Lee I flow, a seasoned vet ???

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Derek Minor]
So pimpin’ what it is, take a minute and holla at’cha kin
Unashamed to rep Christ, homie 116
So what I look like, worry about ya hater friends
He elevate me over them, Air Jordan
See come and hit ‘em with Divine, I’m with it, I’ma fall but the Lord protect us all
Say whatever you like whether you wrong or right, but I still got love for y’all
So while you talkin’, we workin’, givin’ truth to the Lord
I can’t see you haters at all, my focus on the cross

[Verse 6: K-Drama]
I Air Jordan on ‘em, I can see myself in the air scorin’ on ‘em
I throw a table in the church, chair soarin’ on ‘em
And like Jesus, I bust a Jeff Gordon on ‘em
I gotta zoom on past
I’m never turning back, made to shine in his face
See Coach Christ on the side, gotta tighten up the lace
And check the ring finger, he the champ, never died
I leveled in the air, the cross with living water out they mouth[Intro: Derek Minor]
All rise, all this, all mine
All day, all night, all space and all time
It's the God who put you online
That's alzheimer's , memory corrupted
(You offline)

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Universities go and they plant planets and it outstanding
And it's outlandish to be out actin' like you out tracking'
You are not running anything, not even jogging
Not even trotting, not even walking, He take your breathe away
There's no inhaler to help with that asthma be cautious!
Created our bodies and painted us colors, is that something you have considered?
Well in all of your figuring how did you figure you're more than an action figure?
This the presence of greatness, bow to the Lord
Not the girl in New Zealand, now only one royal
You've met him before

[Hook]
Aye this that presidential, creme de la creme
That top shelf creme de la creme
And you know it
All hail the King, all hail the King
All hail the King, ya, all hail the King (x2)

[Verse 2: Deraj]
Oh Lord...Good God...OMG
Who made them stars?
Outer space or Hollywood, which way you wanna go?
He made them both, yeah you should know
Who are you, to think he needs you to
Assist Him in the air, like this an alley oop?
Cause see we drop the ball, His love could pick us up
His love could save us all, hasn't changed, you ain't never seen Him
But seem to think you know what I mean
But what I meant to say, is there a single day
And every way you look, cause everything He made
You couldn't top that, with a top hat, on the top shelf with a ladder
That you climbed on, just to get there
He's the most high, hands in the air

[Hook]

[Verse 3: nobigdyl.]
King of all, watching all his enemies fall
Omnipotence is infinite so witness it like kingdom hall
I bet you think you're a god, not at all
You make it rain, He makes it fall, in galaxies that you never saw
And that's royalty and that crown of thorns is worth more than gold
And that's loyalty and He bought us back when we sold our souls
And I'm mourning me cause the king ordered my death
So I put that royal sword in me and I mortified my flesh, turn up
Thank God for the murder, thank God for the purpose
Think I saw Shadrach and Meshach back in the furnace
Thank God we didn't burn up
I would have failed, would have been lost in the spell
If my God had not of prevailed, but my king trill
Because He saved dyl, and also defeated all hell
All hail

[Hook]Whoa

[Intro: Lecrae]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin' to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
On the reel
I'm a man
But I guess it's just my gender
When it comes to manhood
Man we leave it to our sisters
What a tragedy travesty passive in our actions
Living absentee
Stand and wait while asking them to marry me
We wait left into death saying next what a mess
Beating on my chest and thinking I am strong go flex
If you gone take charge for the Lord then you'll lead out
Being one who serves like the one who chose to bleed out
Submitting to authority government that's over me
And to the Father who is sovereign real men stay orderly
I learned to submit because God gives the command
While she follows me cause I follow him with holes in his hands

[Hook: Lecrae (Tedashii)]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

(Bow down
Bow down)
To authority
To authority

And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
(Bow down
Bow down)
To authority

[Verse 2: Derek Minor (fka PRo)]
Hey I don't care what they tell you that cat's trying to sell you
You was made in the image of God his craftsmanship is in your cells dude
You are not a animal or just a foolish beast
You were made to oversee this Creation of the King now
Flashing your badge like a cop that's got some power
But you should be a tool to encourage and empower
And stop runnin' round with women like a little dog in heat
If she disrespect herself show her who she's supposed to be
She a queen and the scriptures say she is the weaker vessel
It's more like fine china
Doesn't mean she's any lesser
The equal wouldn't smash fine art to the ground
So why use your body or your words to tear her down, heyyy

[Hook]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

[Verse 3: KB]
You ask em what's a man?
They say that dude that got them stacks on stacks
In rubber bands finger to the government
I want it I get it it's mine
Can't tell me nothing bro
My money my girl and my nine
These my rules(What you talkin bout?)
No one man should have all that power
He doesn't have it cause power is not ours
Feelin like you in control no you are owned
God is running it do as you're told
Ok let me talk to him real quick
Let me get to talkin bout submitting to authority
Somebody being over me we say no no
But we gotta get that if we are not submitting
Than we missing the fact that we are not our own
God can judge me and the judge says
If you do not follow then you can't lead
Get it
Live it
Got it
Good

[Hook]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority[Verse 1: Tony Tillman]
No more going in circles we know His way at last
And we ain't straying He gave us power to stay the path
And we don't sleep on His teachings we stay awake in class
And find faithful men to break bread like its made of glass
We wake up early and crash late
In the word seeking Jesus with the mad face
Exhorting brothas live ya life like its your last day
In worship being taught the same things like sum classmates

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Gimme a fork, I'm at the Lord’s table with my kin
I need a bib, I'm so sloppy when I get it in
We on that soul food, help us loose the taste for sin
Gave me the itis, got me sleeping on haters again
You say you hungry, I'm telling you come eat
Give me some of your portion, you know that I'm greedy
And I'mma give you mine, nourish the body
Break bread, let's finish the plate, communally

[Hook: ALL]
I'm sitting at the Lord's table tryna break bread
What you holding on, better break bread
We eating over here, get a chair you can break bread
Aye what you got over there, I'm coming over trying break bread
Break bread [16x]

[Verse 3: Canon]
Many have one gift or got a talent to give to papa
Better worship him and edify your sister and your brosha
The spirit gave birth to your talent kinda like a masha
They ask use these gifts for the devil I tell them nada
Now And Our  Talents did we get it from the spirit, then why
Do we Act selfish to those who helpless we sit by
Black ow blow black ow
Come to my house, with a big cow and
Come and sit down, come and get down
Serve it all and give 'em all your best now

[Verse 4: Chad Jones]
Ok that bread ain't yours did you earn whatcha holdin on
It's the baker whose the maker
We should take and put our focus on
The savior said to take the oats and quake 'em microwave 'em bro
Oatmeal beat no meal the Spirit got you so filled
Cheers to life Ted Danson, we work as family Hanson
Or Jacksons, our talents, It's all for one put hands in
If i got it, you got it, By Gods grace you profit
If you offer me nada, Hakuna Matata

[Hook: ALL]
I'm sitting at the Lord's table tryna break bread
What you holding on, better break bread
We eating over here, get a chair you can break bread
Aye what you got over there, I'm coming over trying break bread
Break bread [16x]

[Verse 5: Tony Tillman]
We wrestle through the darkness with people until the day come
We take the truth and shoot it strait like a ray gun
And we strive to be diverse in our communities
All these colors got us looking like a box of crayons
In one faith and baptism we sharing them
With one God who's high and flier than seraphims
So we sit at the table of the Lord God
Breaking bread looking like a bunch of vegetarians

[Hook: ALL]
I'm sitting at the Lord's table tryna break bread
What you holding on, better break bread
We eating over here, get a chair you can break bread
Aye what you got over there, I'm coming over trying break bread
Break bread [16x]And I can't change it
I feel it down in my soul
That I won't make it
Unless the Lord make me whole
Regardless what he say, I can't quit
Regardless what she say, I can't quit
Regardless what they say, I can't quit
I can't quit, I can't quit, I can't quit

I wake up, go to the mirror, what I'm lookin' at?
I don't think I like the person that is lookin' back
‘Cause in my heart I know that evilness inside me
I see the Lord is everywhere, but the Devil's beside me
And he keep tellin' me to trust inside my own self
The Lord he ain't gave you enough, go get your own wealth
You can kill the game with the right mind frame
The whole world is yours mayne, switch like LeBron James
I'm so cavalier for the Lord's glory
But Satan want me immersed in heat the end of my story
And this a piece of me that'll sell out so easily
For some dimes of cheddar, that's so measly
So as I go I fight back with his truth
Air it out in this booth, listen I am livin' proof
That the Lord uses broken men for his own purpose
Justified through his blood, but I'm not perfect

And I can't change it
I feel it down in my soul
That I won't make it
Unless the Lord make me whole
Regardless what he say, I can't quit
Regardless what she say, I can't quit
Regardless what they say, I can't quit
I can't quit, I can't quit, I can't quit[Verse 1: KB]
Goin' in like my first name is holiday
Looking to lose, I already gave it all away
To the Father, you see that money got a mean fade away
Leave you with Pennies and a Hardaway
My motto stay, on that imago dei
Me and my God finna ride on some all the way
The power of the gospel, many will die today
Then come alive, putting faith in the God who reigns

[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Falling, lifeless, livin’ dead, no Michael Myers
Dead end, dead end, dead wrong liar liar
Life lookin’ bad so I took my vision higher
Focus off of me when he came and crossed my wires
Cleared off, come alive, no more asking who am I
My identity, infinity, which means I won’t expire
Truth got me goin’ wild, if you out there in the crowd
And you feel this in your soul, then that mean you gettin’ loud, get it?

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
Minor, I’m where they merk you for a couple grand
Look at the surface, the walking dead, the zombie land
That’s why some people say they’ll never trust the church again
‘Cause these preachers ridin’ clean and they don’t even care
What if our heart stop? Then I guess this the defibullator
And the only thing we preach, the blood of Christ, he’s the one that made us
And I ain’t got no hidden agenda when I rap boy, so hi hater
Come alive now, you ain’t gon’ have time later

[Hook]
Man you ever seen a dead man walking?
Every place he lays his head is a coffin
Deaf to the truth, blind to the light
He think he livin’, he ain’t ever seen life
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
And come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Come alive (you don’t hear me?)
Wake up

[Verse 4: Andy Mineo]
Yeah! Nothing safe ‘round here
My faith is touching everything (everything?) Yeah
I was bought with a price, so my life ain’t my own
If you walk with the Christ, it’s more than just Sunday morning
It’s how I live on the Rock, how you talk to your wife
It’s how I live when I’m home when I cut off the lights
How I’m spending my dough, that’s when my heart is exposed
Am I generous with it, or do I never let go?

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
Man these boys is young, wild, and reckless, scheming on the neck-a-lace
Teachers tell them they’ll never be nothing but a detriment
While you looking past them, they headed for the casket
I’m trying to show ‘em love, why you mad about my tracklist?
You white washed tombs, yeah I hear you quoting Spurgeon
If you ain’t out here loving them, then what’s the point of learning?
Them widows and them orphans, girls having abortions
You prob’ly can't see ‘em, you’re too high up on your horses

[Verse 6: Trip Lee]
You claim to live it up, you’re living for the moment
But you’re dead boy, I smell you decomposing
And we was dead too, so we don’t wanna leave ya homie
‘Cause them reapers placed to keep, your eyes ain’t even open
I got some news for ya, the best you’ve ever heard
The Son died, then came back alive on the third
And He can resurrect you, all you gotta do is say the word
And you can take my word for it, he raised me out that dirt

[Hook][Hook: Sho Baraka & Derek Minor]
I walk with the confidence of ten men
Only cause my confidence is in Him
Courageous men, yeah we go in
Oh yeah, we go in, yeah we go in

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm a truth carrier, barbarian
Hands to the plow how they bury me no fear in me
Years ago, I be up in a dim lit hole screaming, Woah!
As the reefer blow and the liquor pour
On a line of white unafraid to fight stand proud
For a crowd of the devil's children talking loud
Then Pow! the Spirit gave birth to a child
Now you don't know me and you don't know my style
Courageous as I make the sacrifice live selfless
Follow Christ through the dark valley where the death is
Reject sin kill the lion stomp around Jericho
Ram's horn blow, serpent's head crush death blow

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
They want me under that system hunting that
Good life, hood life just like all them other cats
They want me scared man I'm gonna snap
They want me following a lot of them but I ain't hearing of none of that
Running back, look I ain't gotta follow fools
And I ain't gotta follow crews that don't like to follow rules
Ain't gotta try to follow all them hundred dollar dudes
Naw, bruh that ain't my motto and I know I gotta choose
They tell me to rebel and well I ain't enthused
By opposing my creator cause I know that I would lose
Just cause I'm a dude don't mean I need Glocks
I think they got the flu cause they think they need shots
We stop tryna chase them we much rather know Him
We can't see the sun (Son) then a storm finna blow in
We tryna be courageous, let His word soak in
We got that free admission we bout to go in

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sho Baraka]
All creation will be shaken and hearts will be racing
They'll be waiting for the judge and His opening statement
They show courage in the wrong ways
Before I move to Atlanta I knew some real braves
These cowards run the world, I guess they legs are tired
So now they sit in the throne that the Lord desired
We trust in our hero that's how we know we're saved
Yeah, He even gives us strength on our weak days
It's a zoo out there, cheetahs driving Jaguars
And most rappers are animals, lyin' in bars
They claim they run the game, they got that money mayne
But my value's eternal I got forever change
I tried not to judge I was defended once
Until I got booked and saw what the sentence was
I find courage in the Spirit in our God alone
I'm not scared of Mick Jagger's rolling with stones

[Hook][Intro: Trip Lee]
Look at that, what you lookin' at
Look at that, what you lookin' at
Look at that, what you lookin' at

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
In a culture that is crazy, in a world that is fallen
Its hard tryna live this thang according to Your callin
Every time steppin at my heart it's steady prowlin
Desires wagin war back n forth like they brawlin
Yea man hold up, I'm hopin when you see me
That you catch me watchin what I'm watchin it ain't easy
My heart it wants to see joy, but there's too many decoys
And I don't wanna end up in a trap like a dboy
Can't be all relaxed, there ain't no time for getting lazy
Time for us to act cause the times are getting crazy
So I wrote an agreement and I made my eyes sign it
I won't look on a woman with no lust now underline it

[Hook: Trip Lee]
Look at that, what you lookin at
Oooo she lookin; good
Nah man I ain't lookin back
I'm watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thing hard
Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard
Look at dat, what you lookin at
Oooo she lookin good nah man I ain't lookin back
Im watchin what I'm watchin, and yea this thing hard
Better watchin what I'm watchin we gotta be on guard

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Now if I listen to the radio
Then I would have to split open the swisha and fill it with green vine
And if I listen to the TV then you can catch me chasin plenty chicks cause homie they fine
But I DDT my mind put my flesh in the figure four
Yea sometimes I fall but this right here ain't gon kill me folk
Cause if I had to be a blind amputee, I guarantee my Father here is purging me of all my impurity
Bang on em ba-bbang on go hard Father rain on em ra-rrain on em show you God
Cause every time I slow up, that's when my Father show up
Make make ways of escape then I'm right back scrappin like what up
Tell my TV to shutup what you sellin I don't want it
Hide that Word inside my heart, Ron Artest go & guard it no
I don't want your goodies baby you can keep your cookies lady
I know they got M&MS but this road I'm on is slim and shady

[Hook: Trip Lee]

[Bridge: Trip Lee]
With every single glance man my sin tries to kill me
So I ain't givin in all my brothers gotta feel me
I'm free from my slavery you know that ain't the real me
I belong to my God and I can't let no lust steal me
There's nothing I can gain the sister shouldn't move me
Cause my God is holy the epitome of beauty
Bought me with a price and I'm prayin He would rule me
My eyes belong to Him He's my King and Lord truly
As men who trust Jesus, we can't be cool wit all dat
So when my eyes start to trip, I tell em boys to fall back
So if you see me look away don't be surprised
Since I'm in love with my God, I got some covenant eyes

[Hook: Trip Lee][Verse 1]
Gimme 16, I’ll show you what to do
Try and eat a beat like Dwight Schrute
Go ape if you feelin’ right
Let the beast out the cage, it’s the Life of Pi
Boy, pay attention when you hear me
My lyrics like a petting zoo, I’m hoping that you feel me
I shock ‘em all like Pikachu when I come in the building
I’m the only rapper not spinning hits, that's so cavenzi
Or Chevachi? Sheesh, what’s the big deal?
Some people out here chasing toys, it’s a Kid’s Meal
You go in circles for the power, that’s a windmill
But you can win it all and not know how a win feel
Ughh... don’t listen to me though
I’m partially broke and got a problem with my ego
I’m probably hating on you in front of all of these people
They don’t care what the verse say, the hook is what they fiend for

[Hook]
There’s people out here dancing, they don’t hear me though (deaf)
They just want the beat to tell them where to go (deaf)
So every time I grip the microphone
It don’t matter, I just say what I want

‘Cause they just wanna go deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go deaf

[Verse 2]
Gawvi put me on to the cali flow
With the goons on the beach with a calico
They see girls that they’re prolly tryna take home
If they the Jordans in the box, it’s a saved soul …
Get it? Probably not
But the beat hot, so let’s rock
Say what I want, or what you say that I won’t
As long as Jesus on the throne, I ain’t worried about a foe
Librarian flow, in other words, keep me low
And Jesus paid my debt, I ain’t worried ‘bout what I owe
I said Jesus twice, that’s for your checklist
“Well that’s three times” … check this
Some people sound deep, try and show them proof
Find out they’re shallow as a kiddie pool
But it don’t matter what I think, I’m just another dude
That made a song for you to go deaf to

[Bridge]
I know what you came here for
I ain’t ‘bout to make you wait no more
The only reason that we at this show
So you can hear your favorite song

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

I know what you came here for
I ain’t ‘bout to make you wait no more
The only reason that you came to the show
So you can hear your favorite song

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

And then go...
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap

[Hook]
There’s people out here dancing, they don’t hear me though (deaf)
They just want the beat to tell them where to go (deaf)
So every time I grip the microphone
It don’t matter, I just say what I want

‘Cause they just wanna go deaf, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go, deaf, deaf, deaf
Deaf, deaf, deaf
They just wanna go def[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I was nine years old when daddy first touched me
At 15 I ran away and never stopped running
I met a man who took me in 'cuz I was pretty though
He said that you could make some money in my video
I get high and drunk just to make it through a show
And act like I'm enjoying it but really this is all a show
I feel degraded, purity obliterated
This is all I know and I really hate it
Mr. Minor are you listening? I know that you're a Christian
And got computer programs to block me from your vision
And every time you watch me you say that I'm the issue
Your pastor preaching about how not to let me catch you slipping
But maybe I'm a victim, maybe I'm just trapped in the system
And next time you pray maybe I might get a mention (please)
Before you talk about me remember that I'm lost
And your secret pleasure coming at a cost

[Hook: Derek Minor]
Dear Mr. Christian, I know you’re on a mission
I know you say the answer to my problem is religion
I know I’m supposed to change the way I live and stop sinning
But I’d appreciate it if you take some time to listen
Dear Mr. Christian

[Verse 2: Dee-1]
Man I'm on that chronic
Higher than a comet
Sippin' gin and tonic
Drinking till I vomit
Tatted on my arms, tatted on my face
Pants hanging low, nina on my waist
I be slanging soft, plus I got that hard
Die for my hood, ride for my boulevard
I got love for my dogs but never for these girls
It's M.O.E. 'cuz money rule the world
But Mr. Dee-1, I grew up crummy
Saw my pops get killed in front of me
Saw my momma do dope in front of me
Felt like ain't nobody love me
Uniform dirty, dressing bummy
Went to school they called me ugly
Caught the bus they used to jump me
God I just prayed to you Sunday
Now it's Monday, I'm starving
Sip sour milk out of the carton
Talk to myself while I'm out walking should I put myself in a coffin?
I don't know! All I grew up with was trouble
Ain't know no role model, I knew the struggle

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Excuse me, I don't quite understand you
Propaganda and banter and all of this empty chatter
And amidst these amens, hallelujahs, and shuck and jiving
I see a lot of hypocrites and hyper-criticizing
Mr. Lecrae my momma sold me up the river for some rocks
And daddy told me I was nothing but a problem
Now here you come telling me I'm a low down dirty sinner
And you got the nerve to wonder why I'm in these streets robbing?
Well go and get batman, and go get back man
I don't need to be judged by you and all of your wack friends
Ain't gluttony a sin? Why you staring at my gin?
Where I'm from we don't pretend
We know we ain't getting in
Now the world don't trust me
And these streets done crushed me
Thought you were known for love but you just love to judge me
Truth is, ironically you need me around though
'Cuz otherwise you got nobody else to look down on

[Hook][Verse 1]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Ya'll gon' get me bowed up
When that beat hit it's like three kicks in
Yo' knees up to yo' nose, huh
You knows us
Unashamed, Uno Uno Seis, whoa
Tatted on my skin, all up in yo' face, whoa
If I ain't bout that live, then I ain't really livin'
But if you can't see my light then maybe I ain't in it
Champagne, champagne, celebratin' my campaign
I just dug a well in West Africa
But how many of my friends is African, huh?
No habla español, just show me tu baño
Ain't tryna get to know you, I'm too busy readin' Daniel
Most segregated time of day is Sunday service (My Lord)
Now what you think that say about the God you worship?
First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gon change the world
There's no way
It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gon' last more than one day
What you thought, huh?
Faith ain't 'bout no soft stuff
I heard you just went overseas, now come back home and boss up

[Hook]
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water, dirty water
Buy a bottle for a fee, dirty water
Bodies floatin' in the sea, dirty water
Blood flowin' from the ground, dirty water
Ain't no filters in this town, dirty water

[Verse 2]
Worthless, worthless, 400 years we done heard that
My family came here on slave ships
Some herd cattle, some herd blacks
Know some of ya'll done heard that
My kin was treated less than men
That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin
Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize
I must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by
They must be whores cause the master rapes them
And leaves the child
So dead beat daddy was taught to me way before my time
Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains
Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved
Put 'em round your neck, cuz we still hangin'
Hood preacher told 'em they should live as kings
You call him devil, he fightin for self esteem (think about it)
It's hard to dream when your water ain't clean
Now look at Lucifer's scheme as how to be in a team
Blood in the ocean to these African streams
This dirty water ain't nothin we haven't seen

[Hook][Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I live my life like I'm a live forever
Like whatever or whenever, just don't tell me never
I can tell that there's some people that won't see me better
But greatness in our DNA, He ain't made us for failure
Uh, we live our dreams while you sleep walkin'
That sound of destiny too loud so I can't hear you talkin'
They said, "Minor, we be waiting on that fire often"
I'm tryin' to cremate a beat, it won't even see a coffin
Yeah, I bet you think that this that braggin' flow
Talk about some stuff that you ain't got, impress the masses flow
That sell your soul, you can buy your home that's massive flow
Thinkin' to myself, what's a mansion to a castle though?

[Hook: Traneshia "Truth" Chiles]
And now You've given us a new beginnin'
You placed us high above
And there's nothin' that's bringin' us down
This is our empire, empire
This is our empire, empire

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
I see so many problems
The Lord teachin' me patience, feelin' like I'm back in college
I'm learnin' most my issues have to do with economics
But my anger makin' me wanna go and do trigonomics, true
I'm just tellin' y'all where I'm at
Tellin' y'all that I need grace
And I'm still leanin' on that
[?] worried 'bout me that's my dog
He think I'm probably gon' snap
Now I'm talkin' to God a whole lot lately
I'm findin' comfort in that
I'm findin' comfort in that
He said, "Don't you worry 'bout none of this
You actin' like I don't run none of this
You actin' like I'mma put all of this on you
And ain't no way you overcomin' this
My empire never will run out of nothin'
Cuz I am the one who is fundin' this
Just do what I told you to do
Give it all that you got and you risin' above in this"

[Hook]

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
And where we goin' we won't need the sun
Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love
So shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
They said that we won't need the sun
Cause You gon' light the whole world with Your love
So shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me
Shine Your light on me

[Hook][Hook: PRo]
Until they put me in the grave
I will not be a slave today
(I will not be a slave today)
See this is that (this is that) (x3)
That fight music (that fight music) (x8)

[Verse 1: PRo]
Now til I collapse and stop breathing
We never stop beefing
Think I'll fall but I won't
Guess you can stop thinking
Won't consume a bite of food
Til you inside a tomb
Even if that mean that I gotta kill me to kill you
This is 9-11 kamikaze
Inside my mortal body
Not like I'm fighting alone because the Lord got me
I stand strong listen
Don't get me wrong
Though you born inside of me
I hate you with every bone
Make war with my fellow Christians and beat you into submission
We die for the cross
This is more than religion
It's that scrap til you die music
Don't believe the lie music
Crucify the flesh til the Lord crack the sky music

[Hook]

[Verse 2: PRo]
Now hold on, He strong
Endure for a while then homie we gone
It's time to zoom in like a missile
But you can holster your pistol
We fight with the Scriptures
It cut down to the gristle
Go hard til they murder me
Ain't scared of you hurting me
Watch me rise again
They won't burn me to the third degree
This that, this that motivation to get in an altercation with yo, with yo sin
I suggest they just resist Satan
Cause he wanna kill you anytime you believe in the God who exists in three
But ain't no way that I'ma die I'ma go ahead and ride cause the Lord exists in me
His everlasting peace
Is what we fight to see
My joy inside the Lord
Take this world away from me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: PRo]
Around my waist I wear the truth
Righteousness on my chest
Faith repel hate like a bullet-proof vest
It's no turning back
This is much more than rap
Salvation on my dome tuck snug, fitted cap
I cling to the word watch it cut like a ginsu
Catch me on the street trying to bring all of my kin through
Spirit penetrate our heart cold like Juno
But cover your feet with peace
Call it Air Force Uno
Up in Ephesians we see that we fighting legions that wanna leave you with lesions
But homie don't stop believing
The gospel is our weapon, not bickering and yelling
Hold strong to the cross til the Lord is sent from heaven hey

[Hook][Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I've soared with the angels
Wish I was flyin' with them right now
Feel like I fell right out of heaven
And gravity wanna bring me down, yea

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
My failures feel so enormous
But they pale in comparison to You
Lord You, Lord You, Lord
And I can hear you sayin'

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Fly, I know the wind is gettin' crazy now
But don't let turbulence take your desire
You see I'm pointing at you from the ground
Sometimes you need that lift to take you higher
You, you, you were made with dreams
You only see, you've flown away (a-ay-a-ay-a-ay, a-ay-a-ay)


[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to
Fly, fly

[Bridge: Derek Minor]
I thank the Lord that I'm in His good graces
All I know is that I'm free and this feeling's so amazing
Everything I've been through, bringing me close to You
The fact that I'm here is proof
What am I without you, without you, you

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
Another eagle with these wings that are broken
That was made for something greater, and doesn't even notice
Who wasn't on the ground, but should be higher than the wind
Don't be scared of your purpose if you really wanna live
You better fly (fly, fly, fly)

[Chorus: Colton Dixon]
Keep your head up, don't look down
We will rise above the clouds
Let go of the world we know
And we won't touch the ground
Keep your head up and don't loose sight
Of the the hope you hold inside
Fix your eyes to the sky
Cuz we were made to
Fly, fly
Fly, fly[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
I see the glory of the Lord every time the sun rises
I hear the unheard screams of a broken heart
Because every day a son dies
27 million slaves but no plantation
27 million slaves, all different races
This is not the picture the Lord painted in Genesis
Silence is our enemy, our voices can end it

[Chorus]
I have dreamed of a kingdom coming where
Evil drowns in mercy streams
I want to see those rivers of justice
So I use my voice for those who can't speak
I will use my voice for those who can't speak

[Verse 2: KB]
Yeah, yeah, when it's all said and done
Yeah, I pray that everything we said is done
I don't want my son to say I was one of the ones
That watched 27 million suffer and never say
No, no, I won't be that
I don't deserve a mic if I ain't got no feedback
Bring back every girl from the west to the east that
He crafted for His glory, not for making you green backs
I dream that
Every ounce of brokenness and disease that
Bring that to the cross, believe that He redeems that
Sees that type of world that my daughters can breathe in
Where the beautiful feet that go where the needs at

[Chorus]

[KB]
C'mon, C'mon

[Bridge]
Oh, none of here are just a number
We all have a name like any other
There's breath inside your lungs
And you are my brother
My God, when will we stand
Stand together

[Chorus]
I want to be the kingdom coming where
Evil drowns in mercy streams
Oh, let me see those rivers of justice
So I use my voice for those who can't speak
I will use my voice for those who can't speak
I use my voice for those who can't speak[Hook]
They wanna see us fall, but we gon' set it off
Take it to another level till we dead and gone
That's why we gon' get it in, in, in
We gon' get it in, in, in
I'm reppin' for the King, put that on His name
Won't a thang change till they put us in the grave
That's why we gon' get it in, in, in
We gon' get it in, in, in

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Now till they put me in the grave I'm a ride
My homies by my side
Yes sir I'm on my grind to let them know He live and died
On the third day Christ came out the ground
That's why I got to lay it down
Blind till He elected me, so how you like me now?
Choppin' on the block when I hit 'em with a little bit of truth of the King who rose
Humble when He came the first time
But the next time He come he gon' smash his foes
That's why I pack my clothes
When He come back homeboy I'm gone
Feel the same way I feel then let's roll
But till that day I'm into my soul PRo

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Suzy Rock]
Like Aaron Rodge(rs) on the 10, You know we gettin' in
We recruitin' for the Saints but this ain't New Orleans
And you can check our roster baby we bear no impostors
But the merits of our cross is crazy go off-off our rockers
If your step is your game DJ please turn up the volume
DJ please turn up the volume so the world can hear the gospel
Preach Christ even if they put the heater to my tonsils
I'm a King James, Dwayne Wade, and Bosch 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D-Maub]
You know me and P-R-O gon' G-E-T I-T I-N
Ain't no shadow of a doubt and I would never doubt
That with Christ in my life I win
Always on the move, always on the go
Always tryna keep him on the high, never on the low
So don't be surprised when I come to show
His character in my lifestyle and when I flow
Yeah, ya boy grind like bad breaks
Hopin' I can get a message across to slow up the crime rates
I put my faith in action cause God ain't no time wait
And with Jesus I'm straight

[Hook][Intro]
Welcome to Minorville
Where the bigger the better
Where the flashier the greater
My world's not based on who I am
But what I have

[Verse 1]
I came up from the bottom
Said hello to satan
Before I crack through the earth's crust
(What, all they do)
Post up, drink good, and smoke blunts
When I was coming up
They were clapping at ya'll
But nowadays the chopper's givin' applause
See, if the love of money is the root of evil
It's no wonder this culture brainwashing our people
Hey, why else would college graduates parade around as dope boys?
Dumb their whole life down, Oh boy
He got a bad dime piece tho
While she gon' bare it all for a tv show
Networks making tons of dough
We out here looking like CB4
I feel like you must of missed it
Put here your whole society around riches
While kids in Africa put water on they wishlist
We buy a couple more Benz's

[Hook]
All I hear is
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Ahhhhhh ahhhhhh Yeeah
Mo' money
Mo' cars
Bigger house
(Mo' mo' yard)
More fame
More applause
Why settle for that
When you could have it all

[Verse 2]
Flippin' through a hundred channels, it ain't nuthin' on
Then I heard this preacher say he praying for my soul
But, if I really want the blessings of the Lord to shine
I need to buy this magic oil for $9.99
So if I put this chicken grease on my fo-head(forehead)
And spin in five circles like you said
You're telling more and have no debt
Even though my credit bad and I ain't even got a job yet!
I smell a crook here in the castle, I ain't talking fashion
To sell hope for broke promise 'em all a mansion
To Turn God into a genie
And you Aladdin
Makin a fool out of the church while the world laughin
See you ain't gotta be a Christian to know that this is fishy
When the church like casinos with slot machines missing
Yo' congregation put food on they wish list
I see you buyin' more Benz's

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Buy my new CD when it drop let your friends know
When you try to book me for a show, here go my info
I'd by lying if I tell you some time
It's just to get dough
And I say "Just cause my family matters
I can't have my Wins low"
Our Father who are in Heaven who bless this flow
I wanna Stellar, but I'll settle for a Grammy tho
I want to be a movie star at least give me a cameo
Overlooking all the Lord's done before
Look, I got everything
My wife's a fly dame
Bunch of Twitter followers will
Gas me up like Octane
I get love in The South
A lot of artists say you're hot man
Plus, The Lord saved me
It's supposed to be 'bout His fame
I know people are losing business
By jocking from my position
While I steadily look at Heaven
Beggin' for somethin' different
The Father gave me everything on my wish list
And now I'm dreamin' bout Benz's
Hands out like

[Hook](G-G-Goonies never say die!)
Yeah! PSA Volume 2 mayne
We back!

He on the grind
Hustlin' till his bank gon swolle'
No rubber bands homie cause his bank don't fold
Make it rain, sips of Rosé
But it's gon catch up with him one day
Partner you can have it all (you can have it all)
I said you can have it (you can have it all)
Cause even if you ball, you never be king of it all
That's reserved for the Lord, dog you can have it all

They say this paper make this world spin
Chase sin, get dough till the world end
Back in the day I was in love with the world then
But then I kicked her to the curb she was my girlfriend
Hey, she said that I can never leave her
But now I'm married to the Lord, no prenup
Still acting like I need her
But all this truth in the way I can't see her

I don't need the money and dough to make me
Hear what you murmur here and Imma take heed
If I go back she'll probably play me
A lot going on it's more than you see
Anti-swag, I ain't looking for approval
I'm killing what's inside of me that's looking for approval
Weird, I want this pride in me to disappear
Cause if it wasn't for the Lord I wouldn't be here
So while you chasin' chains with piece the size of chandeliers
I make a toast to the King, cheers![Introduction]
Yeah, it’s PSA Volume 3
The final conclusion. Pay attention

[Verse 1]
I came in the game stuntin’ on my haters
Who knew I would be praying for ‘em years later
Mayne, what I ride, I went from being most wanted
To signed to a label whose music is most wanted
Some would say I came up, finally built my name up
You doing pretty good, why you changing everything up?
Let me explain, I’ve been forced through adversity
I’ll school you to the rules of Derek Minor University
Keep God at the center of your plans
Family is important, so be a man
Life is more than whip whippin’ in the Benz
And if they see you wrong, then you better clean the lens
I never planned to be on entertainment
‘Cause my family in the hood
Y’all ain’t seeing the picture, I’m here to paint it
You looking for that bubble gum, candy coated, I ain’t it
I gotta keep it real, ‘cause the truth you can’t replace it

[Hook]
So come aboard this plane, please let me take you higher
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
There’ll probably be some turbulence, but
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
Let me take you higher
We know who’s in control and I bet He take us higher
Bet He take us higher, bet He take us higher
PSA Vol. 3, let my symphony take you higher
And I’m no longer PRo, introducing Derek Minor

[Verse 2]
Ok, I’m putting on for my city, New Jerus. my home boy
You could find me in Yak Town, in Cashville I roam boy
Shout out to BJ, the mayor of M-Town
RMG, Reach Records, we shut this thing down
What a world we living in, Imma let you know about it
Dirty where we work, this time I flow about it
My people going to jail, they ain’t got no hope about it
So I’m screaming out Jesus, my faith in His throne around it
116 when I claim, man we sort of like a gang
‘Cause we rep ourselves proud, ain’t no lames where I stay
Yelling “God Over Money”, shout to Bizzle in the H
And my name may have changed, but the mission still the same
The Lord told me He making me something greater
Scales gone from my eyes, I see the savior
If you don’t like where I’m going then give me prayer
But I prefer you ride, let’s see where this journey take us

[Hook]
So come aboard this plane, please let me take you higher
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
There’ll probably be some turbulence, but
Let me take you higher, let me take you higher
Let me take you higher
We know who’s in control and I bet He take us higher
Bet He take us higher, bet He take us higher
PSA Vol. 3, let my symphony take you higher
And I’m no longer PRo, introducing Derek Minor[Intro: Chad Jones]

Uh, it's my off day and I'm loving it
Blocking out my strugglin'
Gotta couple friends with a bunch of kids, came through, so cool
Made food, Redbox, two movies and it's not due
Know who's who in my castle
We pumped up no gaso
And my kids asking for ice cream
I'm saying yes, no, have some
Man, check the fridge that's if we got it
Mess with me you know I got it!
Working hard is my major
I minored in frustration
Today my celebration don't you mess up my staycation

[Verse 2: Chad Jones]
Got that invitation I sent

Then the road trip, my bros here, we gonna flip that old script
Grown man situation, no compromise vacation
Keep going no matter what
No pass or punt but we lapping up
Oh you messed up the flow, didn't ya?
Autographs, want more pictures, some folks just won't get it
You heard me say it, leave 'em alone, didn't ya?
By the hand won't mind me alone
She look better in lil' Jones
That's all me, all me, all me, that Drake song

And I'm just sitting here enjoying my life, (my life)
And I don't smoke, but you're blowing my high, woah-oh now. (you lowered my high youngblood)
Hold up now, hey, I've been trying to do something right
But everybody want to start a fight. (woah yeah)
Hold up now, hold up now!

[Hook: Derek Minor and Roz]
