[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
All of my youngin's some savages
Run in your trap, hit you up for them packages
Rob you for bricks, finesse you for pounds
Fuck all that talkin', they layin' you down
That'll teach niggas 'bout playin' around
Cartel connected, you better respect it
Fuck up the paper, send you to your maker
They layin' you 6 feet under the ground
Ridin' with choppas, masked up like Chewbacca
Got dreads like a Rasta, free all of my patnas
This one for Sosa and Gio, I got yah
Bentley what's happenin'? Lil Tony what's crackin'?
Dub, TG, DuRu what it do?
Don Don I see you laid back and be cool
I'm fuckin' this ho and she wet as a pool
I'm feedin' her dick and you buyin' her food
Shoppin' and robbin' and robbin' and shoppin'
Break bread with my niggas, you know how we rockin'
Hittin' these licks and countin' this cake
I don't give a fuck, I'm bearin' my face
Hopin' I live to see me a new day
E got that choppa and ready to spray
I'm runnin' through bitches, what more can I say?
Kush came from Cali, shout out to the Bay

[Hook: BankRoll Bird] x2
Niggas I know, they come shop for the work
Lay you on the floor and take all of your cash
Fuckin' these bitches, no cuffin' these bitches
No lovin' these bitches, they all for the smash
Niggas I know, they come shop for the bricks
Lay you on the floor and take all of your pounds
Got love for my niggas, shed blood for my niggas
Bust slugs for my niggas, I'd die for my rounds

[Verse 2: BankRoll Bird]
I be with the dope boys  like that nigga Ricky
Money got me hypnotized like that nigga Biggie
It's get rich or die tryin' like that nigga 50
And I'm about to go dumb like Timmy
You ain't talkin' money, we look at you funny
Lil nigga you wastin' your breath
I told my niggas, "I'll see you at dinner"
We eatin' 'til nothin' is left
My bro in the kitchen, he chef
But he keep the TEC, you would think he a ref
That .30 on me like I'm Steph
But all my bitches as jazzy as Jeff, Fresh
Prince in the city of Queens
Chasin' that sack 'til they crown me a king
Sacramento home team
I'm better than clever, ball harder than Webber whenever
Whoever however they want it
No competition, ain't got no opponents
My seat at the throne, they can't stand that
Cause I Eminem, Kim and Stan rap
A nigga might start shootin' if I don't know y'all
My city made a nigga's heart so cold, dog
Your bitch got nice lips and I'm like road dog
Pour 4's 'til I'm throwed off
The biggest menace since Dennis and O-Dawg (Aye)

[Hook: BankRoll Bird] x2

[Verse 3: YB]
To keep it one hunnit, I'd rather get blunted
These bitches be all for the smash
I'd bleed for my brothers, I love 'em, we thuggin'
They run in your spot for the cash
A bitch nigga run up, I post up with gunnas
It go down they bustin' your ass
I'm up 'til the sun up, I'm juugin' with Bird
No Stunna, we overgrind hard for this cash
We ain't kiddin' like JK, my homeboy got an AK
Only aimin' where your hood hang
It rock-a-fella like Just Blaze
The AK MJ how it give fades
Pussy niggas Shaq feet, boy you been gay
These niggas MIA like where the Heat stay
I'ma catch 'em with the work in the breezeway
Better freeze or catch a bullet like a Brees play
We need cake like a b-day
I hang with my niggas, my niggas my woes
Don't fuck with too many cause niggas be hoes
Bitches ain't shit, they gon' fuck with your foe
All for the smash so I'm passin' a ho
Sprint to the money, I dash and I go
Cause niggas be bitches and actin' like hoes
Be screamin' "Fuck 12" when they call em' the most

[Hook: BankRoll Bird] x2

[Verse 4: DuRu Tha King]
Nigga go crazy on yappas
Run with them choppas, cookin' up beef with that China
I'm a young nigga who's solid
Max on that shotta, Dub TG that's on my mama
Show me a check or show me respect
Either way it go I'm comin' for necks
These bitches around me, they know I got next
You takin' her out, I'm takin' her mouth
She strip on the side, I'm dick on the side
Broke down a whole brick and got rich on the side
Come to my crib, you see killas inside
Shout out to Beata, I'm from the north side
Bless up to Ghetty, I love the west side
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' it out
Boy you should die, come to my city, you might not get out
Niggas be claimin' they know me, don't know what you talkin' about
Nigga don't try to lil bro me, you'll get a gun in your mouth
My nigga that's not a real Rollie, why are you playin' around?
See you let these bitches control you, you are not fit for the crown
Kings

[Intro: John Milton]
Let me give you a little inside information about God
It's my time now

[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit 'less there's 36 O's in the key
OG niggas call me big bruh
Knowing goddamn well that they older than me and
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit 'less there's 16 O's in a pound
New god flow
Nigga this that new god flow, y'all bitch niggas better bow down
I ain't worried 'bout shit

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Denzel with the L at the end of the noun
Makin' sure their child could see the cap and the gown
Too many lil niggas still runnin' around
Come face to face with the wild and that's the end of your child
Universe, gangsta is the god of the sound
From the planet of the nectar on the sea and the isles
Wanna see an angel dead? Let's walk a few miles
With a sword, halo, and a crown so round
Like root canal, in your mouth
Fuck around you get 40 cal
Bitch what the fuck is beef to a slaughterhouse?
Got sticks that'll knock your baby momma out
Scratch that, knock Harry Potter out
Hit his head on Obama's couch, nail Obama's scout
Y'all niggas is sauerkraut
When the villain bring the choppers out, then they call you out
Tell me what's that about? When you catch 'em then you ash 'em out
Get the money then I'm cashin' out
Really what is that about? What's that about?
My nigga, tsk tsk
Only shoot once it's a hit, and if you shoot twice it's a miss
My nigga bang bang
Fuck that, let his brains hang, nigga fuck that let his brains hang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
36 O's in a brick, 16 O's in a pound
AK47 with the red beam and a drum on that bitch hold 150 rounds
Go on, ride with your squad
Nigga you could die with your squad, tryna get live with your squad
Young OG, nigga I'm a young OG
Get toe-tagged tryna play hard
And it's money over boppers
My young nigga's ex pill-popper, all of 'em ride with them choppers
Call a mortician, ain't no need for a doctor
Call a mortician, ain't no need for a doctor
Dead on arrival, yeah I said dead on arrival
Swear to God on a stack of Bibles
Headshot a nigga, reassuring no survival
Headshot a nigga, reassuring no survival
Cold heart nigga, that's how they raised me
Kill or be killed so you really can't blame me
Straight up the gutter where they killin' over words
Fuck around and get toe-tagged in front of your baby
Nigga get buck
Swear to God nigga get buck, first time let it be your last
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit send a murder gang at your pussy ass

[Hook]

[Break: Deniro Farrar]
Bow down (Fuck nigga!)
Bow down (Fuck nigga!)
Bow down (Fuck nigga!)
Bow down (Fuck nigga!)

[Outro]
Better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven, is that it?
Why not? I'm a fan of man[Verse 1]
Sick of putting work in the plastic
Off-white work, Michael Jackson
Sick and tired of running, ducking, dodging these cases
Down to kill a nigga when it comes to big faces
Going in a fuck nigga mouth, no braces
White girl cocaine crazy
Let her snort lines till' her body start shaking
Feelin like a rafer in the 80's
Can't get money, these fuck niggas talking
If a nigga cross em', my shooters gone off em'
Living like kings, manoeuvre like bosses
Want everythang, we ain't takin' no losses
Light turn green, better hope you ready
Selling break-down my nigga that's petty
Straight drop, dope, amphetamines, go crazy
Stealin' from they family, abandon they babies
First to the mud, fuck you, pay me
Gotta get money, I just had babies
Gotta get money, cuz the fuckin' rent do
Aim at ya' head, nigga won't miss you
Ridin' in the rental hand on my 2
Paranoia like a bitch, still doing what I do
I don't really want 2, but I feel like I gotta
Main bitch be holdin' me down, she a rider
Don't need scales for the work, I'm higher
Straight from the mudhouse, built this empire
Couldn't keep a job, shit, I always got fired
Turn to the streets, then a nigga got hired
Servin' all this work, got my name on fire
If your bitch made it, somebody gone try her
Make a couple mill, maybe then, I'll retire
Smoke 10 blunts, won't get no higher, bitch

[Chorus]
Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin') x4

[Verse 2]
Sick of putting weed in the bag, smokin' cigarettes till my mouth taste ashy
Can't see me, fuck nigga need glasses
Better drop rounds boys oops they plastic
Tryna' make my last 20 stretch like elastic
Hood hot and the police harrasin'
Threw me on the ground and they talk to me nasty
Holes in my shoes and my blue jeans ashy
Can't get a bitch, Imma live with Ashley
She in love with money, so the situation tragic
I'm a broke nigga, so we always clashin'
Dropped outta school, shit I was barely passin'
Used to be an underdog, now I'm like a captain
Grew up in the streets, yeah, I never had a daddy
Payed a couple bills, tryna' make momma happy
But she say money never bring satisfaction
How the fuck you know? We ain't ever had it
Flyin' on my rug and I'm feelin' like Aladdin
Smokin' this kush, making me lag
Heart start beatin', heart start collapsin'
Baby on the way, bout to be a pappy
Gotta leave the trap and make this rap happen
Ain't gotta job, she always askin'
Shit I'm tryna' make lil baby girl happy
But she ain't happy nigga, but I'm happy with her
Work hard tryin' not to be a savage nigga
Sick of livin' my life like an average nigga
Spendin' money really hard, tryna stack it nigga
Sick of puttin this work in the baggin' nigga
Play with my money, imma smash it nigga
Chasing this cash got me so tired
Smoke 10 blunts won't get no higher
Bitch

[Chorus]
Tired of robbin' (Tired of hustlin')
Sick of dodgin' (Tired of duckin')
Sick of fussin' (Tired of fightin')
Done with rappin' (Tired of writin') x4Lord, forgive me âcause the way Iâm living
They say what goes around comes around
Iâm gonna get whatâs coming to me
Guess Iâll be strapped up till they lay me down

And I done did too much to say
I never go to church and barely pray
Lately Iâve been going through some things
Hell, what the fuck Iâm supposed to say?

âCause I just had two baby boys
Iâm always calling their mamaâs out their name
When I get caught in my emotions
Lord, I swear Iâm tryna make a change

Ain't wrote my brother Tune in the month
But Iâm always texting with these hoes
Feel bad whenever he call my phone
He had a court and I ainât even show

And my little brother looking up to me
Lord, I swear I ainât no role model
My uncle a fucking alcoholic
Canât even eat unless he got a bottle

I been stressing about that money lately
It got me âbout to rob a fucking bank
And my mama fuck with bitches now
I could judge her, but I really canât

âCause the way Iâm living ainât no better
I said the way Iâm living ainât no better
I just got in beef with whatâs his name
So now Iâm riding strapped with my Beretta

Laying in my bed, canât get sleep
Eyes wide open and Iâm staring at the ceiling
99 problems but I really got a million
You don't know my struggle so don't tell me that you feel it
Spit it from the heart, I know they gonna feel it
I was born real so cowards gonna feel me
Watching my back âcause I know they wanna kill me
Donât go nowhere without my semi
Daddy was a killer so the bloodline in me
Heart of a lion even though a nigga skinny
Come to my hood and you gonna see plenty
Matchbox chevy with the hubcap missin'
Niggas on dope walk around all timid
Dope dealer pass through the hood in a Bentley
Never gave back to the hood where Iâm from
So the niggas from the block where Iâm from gonna get it
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Till they head get bust and they ass need stitches
Blinded by the greed so you better pay attention
Money don't make you real, my nigga
Better run a valuable motherfucking dollar
'Fore them hungry niggas break you of something proper
City of the Angels where they ride with them choppers
Eat, shit, sleep and even die with the chopper
I ainât got nowhere to go, my nigga
Got beat down to the floor, my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
âCause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well Iâmma tell y'all like my nigga tell me
While I see it well enough they never grow, my nigga

Laying in my bed, canât get sleep
Eyes wide open and Iâm staring at the ceiling
Never go to church and my mommaâs feeling hurt
Praying at night âcause she know that Iâm sinning
Best coming so you know I gotta get it
Money coming fast so you know thatâs how Iâm spending
I ain't got credit so the whips on me when I drop out work another day you rented
Unmarked car keep riding through the hood, with the Feds in the town and they might be in it
Niggas on tha westside just got bopped with a couple of 'em blocks so they might be snitching
Calling my phone, wanna talk about business
Ain't it fucked up because I smell something fishy
Everyone's fucked, tryna handle my business
Trigger finger itching and my eyeballs twitchin
All this work in the goddamn kitchen
Everytime I cook, a nigga get nauseous
Peepin out my blinds because the chopper feelin cautious
Runnin from the law, got a nigga so exhausted
That's all I know my nigga, ya'll hardhead and it shows my nigga
Money be the root of all evil, gotta watch your people sometimes you don't know them niggas
But that's how it goes my nigga, got beat down to the floor my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
âCause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well Iâmma tell y'all like my nigga tell me
While I see it well enough they never grow, my nigga[Intro]
Yo, Deniro Farrar
Peaceful music, nigga
Know that
Every morning I wake up
I look to the skies above and thank God for another day
Every night before I go to sleep
I look up to the stars and I pray
It donât matter if you a scared nigga
A real nigga or the mother of a dead nigga
You still look to the sky when you pray
Know that

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Birds chirpin', druggers lurkin', tryin' to find they crack rock
Iâm in the kitchen helping my little niece pack up her lunch box
Still do or die 'round these parts so my gun cocked
Never know who might approach while standin' at her bus stop
Kiss her on the forehead, tell her make her uncle proud
Right after I hurt a nigga I fire up my blunt of loud
Now it's time I hit the block, take my chances sellin' rock
I'm already fire hot, just had a run-in with the cops, yo
(They look at the sky)
Staring off into the sky, smoking kush until I'm high
Watching my life pass me by, Iâm still tryna' figure why
My mama serving fast food, she work until her body tired
Do it all tomorrow, got too much pride to borrow
Iâm selling drugs to my fam with no remorse or sorrow
Just tryin' to buy some time cause we ain't promised tomorrow
My cousin's car got repoed cause he ainât pay his condo
I'm knee-deep in the dope game getting money in my cargoes

[Verse 2]
Reminiscent 'bout them days
Holding hands with my mama walking on that playground
Now Iâm caught up in that drama
Just a statistic, upliftin' niggas spirits
I was born with the gift to paint these pictures with my lyrics
I've been diagnosed the sickest
With none of y'all permission
I used to get beat with switches
Now we beat niggas pretendin'
I'm gone off that gremlin and arms reaching my semi
Paranoid, schizophrenic
Pray to Lord ya'll forgive me

[Verse 3]
Shit, Iâm just a lost bird flying on the wrong path
My nigga with them chickens make them jump back a whole half
Feedin' pigeons with my niece
I'm tryin' to help her with her math, birds of a feather flock together
Iâm so fucking glad
I turned out the way I did, without the help of my dad
Now Iâm all alone, blowing strong in my bachelor's pad
Penthouse on the top floor, I canât see shit but these birds
They told me that I could fly, now my body on the curb
Word

[Outro x2]
Every night I hit my knees
I just pray that god turns me into a bird
I fly away (x2)

Know thatChorus x 2
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

[Verse 1]
Roll up blunts of that dro
Bullet proof under my clothes
Clutching my .45 close
Told mama that I love her, but we all gon' go
Walking with my head hung low
Wishing all my niggas wasn't dead no more
Reminiscing about days when we hustled for the dough
Drug money in my hands made my heart go cold
Always bending down, guess I ain't know
Never had shit, always wanted more
Nigga told me, can't take it when you go
Watch your enemies and you better keep them close
Going bout a hundred on a dead end road
'Til the pearly gates, seen God at the door
Fuckin' with the devil, I done sold my soul
Feeling bad cause I cheated on my girl wit' them hoes
Baby girl I love ya, don't want you to go
Doing what I can but a nigga still broke
Stay by my side, she ain't with me for the dough
Thinking about suicide with my brains on the floor
Never had a daddy, it was just big bro
If it's all over, I just want him to know
I ain't give up on rap, wouldn't stop 'til I blow
But the world about to end and it coming for my soul
And I don't wanna go

Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

[Verse 2]
Lord if you coming, give a nigga a sign
Lord, killer trying to ease my mind
Never went to church, occupied with crime
Stay down in the trap, busting down those dimes
Took my charge cause the pack was mine
Dropped in a cell, counting down the time
Dropped outta school, told mama all the time
I'mma go get saved but I'm always lying
Trying to live right in a world that's wrong
Just a nigga with a heart broke song
Can't get sleep, been up bout a week
Popped so many pills that my heart skipping beats
Waiting on the end, still selling my kit
Trying to stack money for a brand new benz
Looking for a lick cause a nigga need ends
Trying to find my dogs but they blowing in the wind
Caught up on the strip or they locked in the bid
So I'm praying, hoping that they get heard
Wishing they was free like some motherfucking birds
And I'm still in the hood where they killing over words
God looking down like "You niggas got nerve
Killing over money, hit the mall and splurge"
Worried bout the end, I can feel something
Seen them angels coming and the five all running

Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g[Verse 1]

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Thereâs a whole lotta hoes, and a whole lotta niggas
Clint Eastwood with the fight is gorilla
Turn the warfare to a cold-blooded killer
Take a load off my mind with the paraphernalia
You not familiar, might end up dismembered
My heart equals the 31st of December
Got an ice box where my heart used to be
Whats so bad about ya, really never was for ya
In the first place, you got me in the worst place
Wanna get you at a slow pace, he turned into a coke case
Toe-ticking with no fix, procaine
Clutching the stick at the niggas who balding
November, out of lease, having you falling
Death that you caused is outta here
Outta this atmosphere, the captains here
Twenty-three to your front like a Cavalier
Mixed with Jim Carry, got a mask the tears
Like Paul Revere, gotta warn you all
? sweet like alcohol
Mushrooms is my adderall
Rest in piece to all locked dogs
Lido?, TT?, and China man, wait hold up
These niggas dont understand, how we do
(How we do it on the other side playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
But you do when the gun is aimed at you
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(What can I do)[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
43 hours in, I'm on a money binge
Wanna know where I been? I'm where the money is
Now count it out, thousand dollar piles

[Hook]

[Verse 1: ST 2 Lettaz]
See oftentimes I get lost in time
360 cents in every hour
So that means every second cost a dime
So imagine what I'm spending in a fiscal year
When bills start to pile up
And days start to disappear
So fuck a watch, I watch the sky
If the house at noon, made it back 'round sunrise
But you can't always follow the stars
So I walk by faith and try to follow my heart
My hometown on now, put it down for my home state
Young Superman still fly with no cape
And I was training in the rain all by my lonely
Now I'm winning; motherfuckers want to help me hold the trophy
So they ask why I rap about overseas
I tell them most of my Gs got cases so they can't leave
The state, or they never left the 'Ville
So I hit 'em up on Skype, show them the view from my hotel

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
(Shady Blaze, I see you
ST, what's happening, bruh?)
Out the concrete a rose grow
I'm from the block where they pill pop and guns blow
Them peewees strapped, where the fuck they finna run for?
Police patrol, we still manage to get the dope sold
That's how it go
I never been a stranger to the trap
I'm countin' up this dirty money scattered 'cross my lap
Hand on my strap, paranoid cause I'm serving smokers
Gotta watch my enemies and try to keep my friends closer
You can't tell who is who, I swear this world full of vultures
Can't trust a motherfucking soul, what the game showed us
Maneuver smooth cause them pigs tryin' to meet their quota
You get a extra five years, you lockin' with that soda
In Austin, Texas, conversatin' with my nigga Clova
He told me, "'Niro, keep on grindin' 'til you get exposure"
Christmas and Bentley with me, tryin' to get some bitches over
And Shady Blaze, my fuckin' dog, we gettin' closer
To flying private jets with ST, I'm gettin' chauffeur
But in reality I'm just a rapper trying to make it
Out my current situation with my lack of patience
Slowly embracing this rap shit as my occupation
Need a Bugatti, I'm on Twitter, DMing with Satan
Murder on my mind, I stop by the police station
Blew the cop head off that kill my nigga Aaron
I call that reparation
Bustin' like I'm crazy, pistol off safety
God, save me

[Verse 3: Shady Blaze]
I'm in the studio every day hoping for better days but I keep getting the worst, yeah
People singin' and tellin' at me but for some reason when I'm in the streets I feel cursed, yeah
I'm all on the gas and I'm tryin' to go fast but it still feels like I'm in reverse, yeah
I just wanna pile up all the money as much as I can 'til I'm up in a hearse, yeah
I got firearms gettin' held back
But the handless pain, I never felt that
Man, I go through the middle just like a tailback
And you ain't gettin' the money, I cannot help that
Nigga one time, bitch niggas want mine
But I eat like it's lunch time
Three niggas come by ridin', it's crunch time
And I threw it all, wrong man for the punchline, okay?
Let's get it, I'm ridin' here
Everybody in the area, I'm gonna have everybody in fear
All you wack male niggas, y'all about to be clear?
Get them motherfuckers droppin' 'til they box on the ear
Shady Blaze and his brethren and I got that drum
She gonna cut with your money, better stop that ho
Nigga one beat, better pop-pop and go
I'm on fire here, nigga, stop drop and roll
My homie sellin' our powder, I'm feelin' like power
The money is ours for 43 hours
(?)
It's time to devour the niggas who nah'd us, we doin' it
I just thought we'd go in it so don't be offended
Get money then spend it, we livin' resplendent
Don't tell my life business, yo, love to my niggas
And fuck all the women we movin', shit...

[Hook x2][Hook]
Cause I've done been back and forth and forth and back
Up and down like all the time, I hope I make it with these rhymes
Cause I've done been up and down and down and up
Stressin' all the fuckin' time, I hope I make it with these rhymes

[Verse: 1]
Cause I've done been back and forth and forth and back
Smoking loud and selling crack
Stood out on the block with cops patrolling, still sold my pack
Running in and out, promised momma I ain't going back
When she heard them sirens, boy, she damn near had a heart attack
Young with no education, I can whip a quarter back
Jumping in and out the game, but I was never quarterback
Bought my first quarter pound, broke it down in quarter sacks
Rick Bard, rooster red, Rio, y'all remember that
Beefin' on the regular, shootouts on our schedule
Block hustlin' baited us, but never was I ready for
Cases that I caught, got me rappin' on the regular
Eliminatin' competition, crushin' all competitors
So let me do what I do, can't nobody fuck with me
Therefore I will not fuck with you, I promise to always tell the truth
Stood out on the block in blistering cold, hustlin' with my troops
Lookin' through my scope, when you're ready, aim that bitch and shoot

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Cause I've done been up and down and down and up
Stressin' all the fuckin' time
Still in the trap, there's junkies shootin' up like Columbine
Grew accustomed to the crime, before I ever went through customs
Police slammed my brother down, locked him up and handcuffed him
Fuck the law, I live above it, bitch I'm thuggin' and I love it
Back and forth, forth and back, arguments about my clubbin'
Momma stressin', baby stressin' worried 'bout me, cause they love me
Weighin' pounds and sellin' P's, my big brother was pushin' keys
Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without no presents under the fuckin' tree
Sat and the round table, breakin' bread with Tune and Steve
Back and forth and forth and back, chillin' with my cousin E
Smokin' loud and pumpin' weed, rap is all the fuck I need
Watchin' movies with my niece, dreamin' 'bout my own fam
Hopin' I get rich off sellin' P's and movin' white grams
Really that's all the fuck I know, .45 tucked in my coat
Before the day my momma go I hope a nigga fuckin' blows up

[Hook][Produced by Ryan Hemsworth]

[Intro]
KOBK the murder gang
Free Tune, that's my bro

[Hook]
What's murder to a nigga doing homicides?
You a bitch nigga I can see it in your eyes
What's pussy to a nigga that be getting pussy?
Living like a G bitch I think I'm Big Tookie

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm a king no crown my nig
Play games get laid down my nig
I make $350 off a zone of the loud
So this $5,600 off a pound my nig
I can hit the trap and break it down my nig
Got a plug out of town on the pounds of mid
So what's pussy to a nigga that be getting it?
I'm running from committment so I'm hitting it and quitting it
Hoes on my line they be blowing me up
You ain't getting shit bitch, but a dick to suck
Wildin' out in public, I don't give no fuck
I ain't down with the price, so I'm sticking you up
Hitting licks with my nigga, then we splitting it up
High as hell, then I'm looking for a bitch to fuck
Heard the feds got the tool, now they're picking you up
But real niggas stay solid, no snitching with us, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck nigga, hol' up
Pump your motherfucking breaks with the ho stuff
That's how niggas get their whole shit swole up
Turn into freeze pops when they see me roll up
I'm out the window with a choppa, they're ain't no love
With my thugs, and they mouth full of gold slugs
And they strapped up, everybody got guns
Acting like a bitch, and we'll treat you like one
Running trains on these hoes just for the fun
I'm the realest, and these other rappers bubblegum
I ain't finna turn rasta, fuck bumping gums
These are niggas, they ain't fighting shit, they busting guns
And they won't stop shooting til the job done
My lil' a partner caught a body, now he on the run
Looking at 30 years and he only 20
Rest in peace Big Tookie and my nigga Timmy
Screaming "fuck the other side!" cause that thug in me
I be leaning like a bitch when that mud in me
That extendo on that pistol nigga don't tempt me
33 inside the .40, boy, that's Scottie Pippen
That's for any nigga thinking about fucking with me
Got yo bitch at the crib and she fucking with me
Got my niggas on a mission to come serve ya
Can't sleep, nigga, dreaming about murder

[Hook]

[Outro]
Aye nigga
Here's the distinction between animalism and humanity
An animal like a goat has no sense of his impending death
Although his brother goat is being slaughtered
The goat is being lured by the green grass offered to him
He stands peacefully waiting to be slaughtered himself
On the other hand
A man see his fellow man being slaughtered or killed by an enemy
He has no choice but to fight to save his brother's life, or fight to save his ownÂ­[Produced by D.K.A.D.]

Let me give you a little inside information about God
It's my time now

[Hook: Deniro Farrar]
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit 'less there's 36 O's in the key
OG niggas call me big bruh
Knowing goddamn well that they older than me and
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit 'less there's 16 O's in a pound
New god flow
Nigga this that new god flow, y'all bitch niggas better bow down
I ain't worried 'bout shit

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Denzel with the L at the end of the noun
Makin' sure their child could see the cap and the gown
Too many lil niggas still runnin' around
Come face to face with the wild and that's the end of your child
Universe, gangsta is the god of the sound
From the planet of the nectar on the sea and the isles
Wanna see an angel dead? Let's walk a few miles
With a sword, halo, and a crown so round
Like root canal, in your mouth
Fuck around you get 40 cal
Bitch what the fuck is beef to a slaughterhouse?
Got sticks that'll knock your baby momma out
Scratch that, knock Harry Potter out
Hit his head on Obama's couch, nail Obama's scout
Y'all niggas is sauerkraut
When the villain bring the choppers out, then they call you out
Tell me what's that about? When you catch 'em then you ash 'em out
Get the money then I'm cashin' out
Really what is that about? What's that about?
My nigga, tsk tsk
Only shoot once it's a hit, and if you shoot twice it's a miss
My nigga bang bang
Fuck that, let his brains hang, nigga fuck that let his brains hang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Deniro Farrar]
36 O's in a brick, 16 O's in a pound
AK47 with the red beam and a drum on that bitch hold 150 rounds
Go on, ride with your squad
Nigga you could die with your squad, tryna get live with your squad
Young OG, nigga I'm a young OG
Get toe-tagged tryna play hard
And it's money over boppers
My young nigga's ex pill-popper, all of 'em ride with them choppers
Call a mortician, ain't no need for a doctor
Call a mortician, ain't no need for a doctor
Dead on arrival, yeah I said dead on arrival
Swear to God on a stack of Bibles
Headshot a nigga, reassuring no survival
Headshot a nigga, reassuring no survival
Cold heart nigga, that's how they raised me
Kill or be killed so you really can't blame me
Straight up the gutter where they killin' over words
Fuck around and get toe-tagged in front of your baby
Nigga get buck
Swear to God nigga get buck, first time let it be your last
I ain't worried 'bout shit
Nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit send a murder gang at your pussy ass

Got the choppa And I'm finna act a donkey nigga
Get cold cased, whole clique get erased
When it come to the money
Boy I'm out for the case
So give me my slice before I take your half
100 mill, 50 mill, you do the math
On the road to riches but I had to take a cab
Trying to drink away the pain & forgot to pay the tab
And I'm getting pulled down and a bucket full of crabs
Niggas heard that I got sesame
Can't shit live if I don't let it breathe
Dumping shots out the forty in their neck till it bleed

Yeah!

[Hook]

[Hook 2]
Marksman and killers right next to me

Marksman and killers right next to me
Bow Down and pay some respect to me
(Evan pass me the light bruh)
Rest in peace, in jeeps, in peace

[Verse 2 ]
Marksman and killers right next to me
Bitch, Bow Down and pay some respect to me
No test in me. Bitches rest in peace
Pull up in jeeps. Boy I know where you be
You a money machine, you a ATM
In other words nigga, you a walking lick
Bitches on my dick
It's money over a bitch
Until the day that I'm rich
And nigga don't forget
If I ever go broke. I'm gone hit me a lick
Nigga take from the poor and they give to the rich
Man fuck that shit going out for this
When cop my gun I'll never bitch
Wreck my Bugatti left that bitch in a ditch
And I need a 100mil before they put me in a ditch
Now I'm riding around strap in my Honda looking sick
Smoking 100 bills
Ink burning my wrist
Symbolizing pain that a nigga went through
If I didn't rap to you, I'll be lying about this
Crispy 100 bills cutting my wrist
And the dirty money came off flipping them bricks
It's all blood money
Trace it back to my people
The almighty dollar makes us feel unequal
People killing people  I done seen so much evil
If you get caught slipping
You won't live to see the sequel

Go !

Can't get sleep, (why?) newborn hungry (yup)
Woke up in the bed with a bitch who don't want me
Voices in my head keep telling me to pray
I ain't got shit to my name but this AK

[Verse 1]

And I'm just a fucking victim to them voices in my head
Been with her for so long yet she a stranger in my bed
She told me I ain't shit, she wish that I was dead
Sick of feeling hunger pains, smoking til my eyes red
Fuck eating a crumb, boy I want a slice of bread
Don't know how to be a father, and that feeling got me scared
I'm looking in the mirror, and don't know what I see
A reflection of my past and it's still haunting me
I wake up to hearing screams, hit the block and serve fiends
Gotta feed my fucking son, you know what the fuck I mean?
And I can't get sleep, he crying cause he hungry
Tried to do his mama right, that bitch didn't want me and I...

(hook 2x)

[Verse 2]

And the only thing I own is this mothafuckin choppa
Sick in the head, I think I need to see a doctor
She always going clubbing, she forcing me to watch him
I feed him then I change him then I set him in his rocker
I should've known better; shit, his mama was a bopper
But that ain't no excuse cause I'm still that baby's papa
Thinking bout them days crying on my mama lap
Asking bout my daddy, shit I wonder where he at?
She looked at me and said that he ain't never coming back
But what she really meant is he was somewhere smoking crack
So ever since that day I put my family on my back
Walking round with my choppa feeling like I'm in Iraq, and I...

(hook 2x)

P.S.A. to all you fuck niggas, mayne. Out here riding rims, throwing money, think y'all doing it big... Take care of your mothafuckin kids nigga. Y'all out here flexing for these mothafuckin hoes nigga, that ain't good business my nigga. Y'all out here popping all that bullshit about all this money you got but your kids out here hurting? Man up fuck nigga[Intro]

Chorus x 2

Thugged out and all my niggas gangster

Fuck around and you gon' feel that banger

[Verse 1]

All you hear is bang, bang
They banging on my block
Oh Lord, oh my, somebody dun got shot
Now all you see is them choppers
Somebody finna get chopped
This murder shit don't stop
We retaliate no spot
Don't nobody talk to the cops
Niggas live by the code
Let's find out where they're staking
Shit, I know somebody gone know
And I know somebody know something
All them people outside
How the fuck none of y'all ain't seen nothing
Load them choppers nigga let's ride
I got homocide on my mind
Four deep and we ride
And in them chevy's nigga we flying
Hurt so bad my nigga I'm crying
Ain't no music and ain't no talking
Shoot the first nigga walking
In they hood, on they street
I'mma get them while none get me
I hit two my nigga hit three
Won't be the end of this beef
Im on pills don't need no sleep
Eyes up open up by the week?
Bitch it's dangerous where I've been
Dangerous where I roam
Always on point
Don't go nowhere without my chrome
And it's danger

Chorus x 2

[Verse 2]

Because all I know is murder
All I see is crime
Get the fuck from out of dodge
When bullets go the flying, better D-U-C-K nigga
Try your luck you think I'm lying
And you be riding in that hearse
Laying in a box that's pine
It's a hazard to your health
Don't you ever fuck with mine
Bitch I'm strapped up with that nine
And it shoot about thirty times
I got killers on my spor
That will knock you out for free
And I put that on [?]
Rest in peace my nigga look beat
Charlotte nigga trigger happy
20 murders in a week
Every time I watch the news, shit that's all the fuck I see
Another dead black male, just a victim of the gun
Nigga at age 21, see them choppers better run
Niggas ain't shooting to scare
They ain't shooting for fun
Niggas been killing for so long to the pain they go numb
Niggas knocking out your brain, then they living on the run
I'm strapped up all the time, won't catch me without my gun
Bitch you know it's danger

Chorus x 2

[Outro][Intro]
Yo, KOBK the murder gang
Shit
Free Tune, That's my bro
Yo, I'm the fucking coldest

[Verse: 1]
In the hood trying to make it out
So what the fuck they mad about?
Rappers in my city don't want me to make a route
Jackers gon' jack so I'm prepared to take 'em out
Baby's on the way and I ain't got a dime
Just a choppa to my name and these books of rhymes
All alone in a room with this crooked mind
Watching rappers' videos knowing I can take their shine
Calm, tell me be patient, and take my time
I been struggling too long now I'm takin' mine
What good is being hot if nobody notice?
That in a room full of rappers I'm the fucking coldest

[Hook]
Only, tells me some things I don't wanna know
And I can't
Tells me some things I don't wanna know
(I'm the fucking coldest)
No I can't

[Verse: 2]
Mind over matter but the matter is
The fact that we live with no time to give
Our fam, we throwing money at our kids
They be starving for knowledge and I can see their ribs
No ambition for college, they sitting at the crib
Selling drugs, probably be the next getting killed
On the block, there's 30 more just like 'em
I don't bond til those crackers come a reindict 'em
Chain smoking blunts, now they searching for a title
That you earned in the hood cause you shot a rifle
Guns make niggas feel tall like the Eiffel
Til somebody shoot 'em down and their body stiffle
Fuck a magazine, you need to read a Bible
Wicked preacher steal money for his own survival
Or maybe I'm just taking notice
That in a room full of rappers I'm the fucking coldest

[Hook][Verse 1]

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Thereâs a whole lotta hoes, and a whole lotta niggas
Clint Eastwood with the fight is gorilla
Turn the warfare to a cold-blooded killer
Take a load off my mind with the paraphernalia
You not familiar, might end up dismembered
My heart equals the 31st of December
Got an ice box where my heart used to be
Whats so bad about ya, really never was for ya
In the first place, you got me in the worst place
Wanna get you at a slow pace, he turned into a coke case
Toe-ticking with no fix, procaine
Clutching the stick at the niggas who balding
November, out of lease, having you falling
Death that you caused is outta here
Outta this atmosphere, the captains here
Twenty-three to your front like a Cavalier
Mixed with Jim Carry, got a mask the tears
Like Paul Revere, gotta warn you all
? sweet like alcohol
Mushrooms is my adderall
Rest in piece to all locked dogs
Lido?, TT?, and China man, wait hold up
These niggas dont understand, how we do
(How we do it on the other side playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
But you do when the gun is aimed at you
(How we how we do it on the otherside playboy)
Yall niggas dont understand how we do
(What can I do)Chorus x 2
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

[Verse 1]
Roll up blunts of that dro
Bullet proof under my clothes
Clutching my .45 close
Told mama that I love her, but we all gon' go
Walking with my head hung low
Wishing all my niggas wasn't dead no more
Reminiscing about days when we hustled for the dough
Drug money in my hands made my heart go cold
Always bending down, guess I ain't know
Never had shit, always wanted more
Nigga told me, can't take it when you go
Watch your enemies and you better keep them close
Going bout a hundred on a dead end road
'Til the pearly gates, seen God at the door
Fuckin' with the devil, I done sold my soul
Feeling bad cause I cheated on my girl wit' them hoes
Baby girl I love ya, don't want you to go
Doing what I can but a nigga still broke
Stay by my side, she ain't with me for the dough
Thinking about suicide with my brains on the floor
Never had a daddy, it was just big bro
If it's all over, I just want him to know
I ain't give up on rap, wouldn't stop 'til I blow
But the world about to end and it coming for my soul
And I don't wanna go

Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end
I'mma tell y'all like a nigga told me
If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g

[Verse 2]
Lord if you coming, give a nigga a sign
Lord, killer trying to ease my mind
Never went to church, occupied with crime
Stay down in the trap, busting down those dimes
Took my charge cause the pack was mine
Dropped in a cell, counting down the time
Dropped outta school, told mama all the time
I'mma go get saved but I'm always lying
Trying to live right in a world that's wrong
Just a nigga with a heart broke song
Can't get sleep, been up bout a week
Popped so many pills that my heart skipping beats
Waiting on the end, still selling my kit
Trying to stack money for a brand new benz
Looking for a lick cause a nigga need ends
Trying to find my dogs but they blowing in the wind
Caught up on the strip or they locked in the bid
So I'm praying, hoping that they get heard
Wishing they was free like some motherfucking birds
And I'm still in the hood where they killing over words
God looking down like "You niggas got nerve
Killing over money, hit the mall and splurge"
Worried bout the end, I can feel something
Seen them angels coming and the five all running

Chorus x 4
Just in case the world end
Just in case the world end

If I gotta die first, I'mma go out like a g[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
My nigga, I don't do pushups
Just pickups and dropoffs
With a bad bitch getting topped off
You try me and get knocked off
For a whole brick of that white soft
Get outlined in that white chalk
Two bowls of loud for that Randy Moss
My niggas shoot, they don't never talk
Jays run up to the car when I pull up, nigga
Coppin' more bands, I cook up, nigga
Fuck no, ain't no hook up, nigga
AK, catch a block shook up, nigga
Your bitch on my meat, she gave me her door key
Put it on me for one week, now that's where my work be

We ain't dated but a week, but still she gave me her key

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I saw your homeboy's picture, man: a grandmother of three (wow)

NBA money, nigga, this just one of my rings
You say a nigga gettin' money, look like no money to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nacho Picasso]
Hopped up out the coffin, gold fangs like I'm Blackula
Poke my bitch in the back and told her, "Work the spatula"
Then I took a piss, I half farted, I have flatulence
I be fucking all these hoes, I don't practice abstinence
Ask your friend, I'm masculine, the boppers keep on hassling
My Mexican on mescaline, stressing him, pressing kids
Pedestrians be stepping in cause I don't look that threatening
Babyface assassin, I throw tantrums, I be flashing
I get high fore I get dressed
Does this mean that I'm high fashion?
Self esteem high, I be high when I be bragging
Breathing like a dragon, beat 'em, leave 'em where we standing
Sniff that white Susan Sarandon or that young Dakota Fanning

Kill your idols, sawed-off rifles
Have niggas bleedin' like a menstrual cycle
Claimin' that title; nigga, what title?
Chopper make 'em dance like a ballet recital

[Verse 1]
Played up with motherfuckin' low cash
Tryin' to get rich with my broke ass
Nigga need bread, I'm lookin' for some more cash
Sick of blowin' back, yo, and now I wanna blow gas
Forty on deck, and nigga I'm gon' blast
Money ain't power, catch up yo' ho ass
Run up on the dope man, with a black mask
You know what it is, nigga, take me to your stash
Now I'm dippin', outta that exit
Whip that dope, make sure I stretch it
Gotta figure free, goddamn good investment
Now I'm known as that little nigga with a nest egg
Fuck that, nigga, blow a hundred on a necklace
Mossberg pump 'case shit get hectic
Badass bitch laid up at the Westin
Feed me grits, cigarillos full of Welch's
Nigga, I'm a badman, badman
Twenty-five thousand dollars cash, man
Have them killers jumpin' out yo trash can
With them red dots on yo Ray-Bans
And I beat a bitch pussy like a caveman
Whip that Benz like a slave master
You can try to run from me but my chopper faster
'Bout to lay the competition out in front of the pastor, nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Kill your idol, even if he me
Mossberg blow takin' off a nigga knee
In the middle of the war zone, that's where I be
Hand on my strap cause a nigga got beef
And that bitch suck dick like she ain't got teeth
Eliminatin' all competition with the heat
Illuminati illuminatin' and niggas can't see
Lame ol' flake is something I can't be
Leave it as an idol, something I can't see
Role model for your kids, my nigga, that ain't me
Better go to church, my nigga, I don't preach
I can only reach the one that I see

[Refrain]
Rollin' up blunts with they mouth full of fronts
Ride shotgun with the front seat slumped
I still black cause he just got jumped
Lookin' for them bitch niggas with the Mossberg pump

[Hook x4]

[Refrain x2][Intro]
Yo, Deniro Farrar
Peaceful music, nigga
Know that
Every morning I wake up
I look to the skies above and thank God for another day
Every night before I go to sleep
I look up to the stars and I pray
It donât matter if you a scared nigga
A real nigga or the mother of a dead nigga
You still look to the sky when you pray
Know that

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
Birds chirpin', druggers lurkin', tryin' to find they crack rock
Iâm in the kitchen helping my little niece pack up her lunch box
Still do or die 'round these parts so my gun cocked
Never know who might approach while standin' at her bus stop
Kiss her on the forehead, tell her make her uncle proud
Right after I hurt a nigga I fire up my blunt of loud
Now it's time I hit the block, take my chances sellin' rock
I'm already fire hot, just had a run-in with the cops, yo
(They look at the sky)
Staring off into the sky, smoking kush until I'm high
Watching my life pass me by, Iâm still tryna' figure why
My mama serving fast food, she work until her body tired
Do it all tomorrow, got too much pride to borrow
Iâm selling drugs to my fam with no remorse or sorrow
Just tryin' to buy some time cause we ain't promised tomorrow
My cousin's car got repoed cause he ainât pay his condo
I'm knee-deep in the dope game getting money in my cargoes

[Verse 2]
Reminiscent 'bout them days
Holding hands with my mama walking on that playground
Now Iâm caught up in that drama
Just a statistic, upliftin' niggas spirits
I was born with the gift to paint these pictures with my lyrics
I've been diagnosed the sickest
With none of y'all permission
I used to get beat with switches
Now we beat niggas pretendin'
I'm gone off that gremlin and arms reaching my semi
Paranoid, schizophrenic
Pray to Lord ya'll forgive me

[Verse 3]
Shit, Iâm just a lost bird flying on the wrong path
My nigga with them chickens make them jump back a whole half
Feedin' pigeons with my niece
I'm tryin' to help her with her math, birds of a feather flock together
Iâm so fucking glad
I turned out the way I did, without the help of my dad
Now Iâm all alone, blowing strong in my bachelor's pad
Penthouse on the top floor, I canât see shit but these birds
They told me that I could fly, now my body on the curb
Word

[Outro x2]
Every night I hit my knees
I just pray that god turns me into a bird
I fly away (x2)

Know that[Intro]
With your feet in the air and your head in the ground
Try this trick, spinning
Yeah

[Verse: 1]
Lost my mind at the voting poll
Police on my totem pole
Hoes is too and they know I'm broke
But my dick is dope and my flow is dope
Running game on her mental
Never fuck with her on her menstrual
Game sharp as a No.2 pencil
Drawing on fuck niggas, no stencil
Red beam on you, no pimple
Let me calm my nerves down
Codeine slowing my words down
I'm swerving on the curb now
Smoked away my memory
And all my evil tendencies
I ain't seen my mind in so damn long
Won't be me, I hope it remembers me

[Hook]
Where is my mind? X3

[Verse: 2]
Lost my mind on a mission
Dope boy still in the kitchen
Or the trap with that Pyrex vision
Cooking dope trynna get me a Bentley, but
My grandma sick, need a kidney
One thing one my mind, gotta get it
Y'all niggas rap about it, I live it
Y'all niggas never seen it, I did it, ugh
Lost my mind, I'm the sickest
Nigga, I don't need no witness
Y'all bitch niggas be the ones that witness
On the stand pointing out who did it, ugh
I'm hollering "fuck your clique!"
I'll fuck your bitch when the case spit
With no kick, they holler "oh shit!"
My mind gone, but I'm focused

[Hook]

[Verse: 3]
Lost my mind in a fucking Bible
Feeling like God when I hold my rifle
Killing off life cause they just recycle
Fuck you, who you? I ain't like you
Balled up fist, and I wanna fight you
Take my life, shit, I know you'd like to
My mind is a weapon and I just might shoot
...So y'all better duck down
Anybody seen my memory?
Laying next to John Kennedy
Or Kurt Cobain, what a goddamn shame
Sometimes I feel like ending me, but
Is it really worth it?
Shit, Cause I'm still searching
For my brain, or a better purpose
Cause right now I feel worthless, then
Karma brung pain, I deserved it
My inner thoughts got deserted
That lack of faith was my burden
It taught me to be more assertive
I got me a pack, start serving
Then got me a gun for the murder
211 them burglars
My evil thoughts go unheard of, ugh
Master mind of my craft, nigga
You think you get half nigga?
You must be high as fuck and out of your mind
I'mma just laugh, nigga

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
All of my youngin's some savages
Run in your trap, hit you up for them packages
Rob you for bricks, finesse you for pounds
Fuck all that talkin', they layin' you down
That'll teach niggas 'bout playin' around
Cartel connected, you better respect it
Fuck up the paper, send you to your maker
They layin' you 6 feet under the ground
Ridin' with choppas, masked up like Chewbacca
Got dreads like a Rasta, free all of my patnas
This one for Sosa and Gio, I got yah
Bentley what's happenin'? Lil Tony what's crackin'?
Dub, TG, DuRu what it do?
Don Don I see you laid back and be cool
I'm fuckin' this ho and she wet as a pool
I'm feedin' her dick and you buyin' her food
Shoppin' and robbin' and robbin' and shoppin'
Break bread with my niggas, you know how we rockin'
Hittin' these licks and countin' this cake
I don't give a fuck, I'm bearin' my face
Hopin' I live to see me a new day
E got that choppa and ready to spray
I'm runnin' through bitches, what more can I say?
Kush came from Cali, shout out to the Bay

[Hook: BankRoll Bird] x2
Niggas I know, they come shop for the work
Lay you on the floor and take all of your cash
Fuckin' these bitches, no cuffin' these bitches
No lovin' these bitches, they all for the smash
Niggas I know, they come shop for the bricks
Lay you on the floor and take all of your pounds
Got love for my niggas, shed blood for my niggas
Bust slugs for my niggas, I'd die for my rounds

[Verse 2: BankRoll Bird]
I be with the dope boys  like that nigga Ricky
Money got me hypnotized like that nigga Biggie
It's get rich or die tryin' like that nigga 50
And I'm about to go dumb like Timmy
You ain't talkin' money, we look at you funny
Lil nigga you wastin' your breath
I told my niggas, "I'll see you at dinner"
We eatin' 'til nothin' is left
My bro in the kitchen, he chef
But he keep the TEC, you would think he a ref
That .30 on me like I'm Steph
But all my bitches as jazzy as Jeff, Fresh
Prince in the city of Queens
Chasin' that sack 'til they crown me a king
Sacramento home team
I'm better than clever, ball harder than Webber whenever
Whoever however they want it
No competition, ain't got no opponents
My seat at the throne, they can't stand that
Cause I Eminem, Kim and Stan rap
A nigga might start shootin' if I don't know y'all
My city made a nigga's heart so cold, dog
Your bitch got nice lips and I'm like road dog
Pour 4's 'til I'm throwed off
The biggest menace since Dennis and O-Dawg (Aye)

[Hook: BankRoll Bird] x2

[Verse 3: YB]
To keep it one hunnit, I'd rather get blunted
These bitches be all for the smash
I'd bleed for my brothers, I love 'em, we thuggin'
They run in your spot for the cash
A bitch nigga run up, I post up with gunnas
It go down they bustin' your ass
I'm up 'til the sun up, I'm juugin' with Bird
No Stunna, we overgrind hard for this cash
We ain't kiddin' like JK, my homeboy got an AK
Only aimin' where your hood hang
It rock-a-fella like Just Blaze
The AK MJ how it give fades
Pussy niggas Shaq feet, boy you been gay
These niggas MIA like where the Heat stay
I'ma catch 'em with the work in the breezeway
Better freeze or catch a bullet like a Brees play
We need cake like a b-day
I hang with my niggas, my niggas my woes
Don't fuck with too many cause niggas be hoes
Bitches ain't shit, they gon' fuck with your foe
All for the smash so I'm passin' a ho
Sprint to the money, I dash and I go
Cause niggas be bitches and actin' like hoes
Be screamin' "Fuck 12" when they call em' the most

[Hook: BankRoll Bird] x2

[Verse 4: DuRu Tha King]
Nigga go crazy on yappas
Run with them choppas, cookin' up beef with that China
I'm a young nigga who's solid
Max on that shotta, Dub TG that's on my mama
Show me a check or show me respect
Either way it go I'm comin' for necks
These bitches around me, they know I got next
You takin' her out, I'm takin' her mouth
She strip on the side, I'm dick on the side
Broke down a whole brick and got rich on the side
Come to my crib, you see killas inside
Shout out to Beata, I'm from the north side
Bless up to Ghetty, I love the west side
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' it out
Boy you should die, come to my city, you might not get out
Niggas be claimin' they know me, don't know what you talkin' about
Nigga don't try to lil bro me, you'll get a gun in your mouth
My nigga that's not a real Rollie, why are you playin' around?
See you let these bitches control you, you are not fit for the crown
Kings

[Hook][Intro]

Three o'clock in the morning, leaving the club horny
Callin' any broad I think woke and I'm on it

[Verse 1]
Trying to maintain that shit that be hangin' with Patricia
But Patricia always hatin' on me cause I fucked her sister
Mr. Hit-'Em-And-Never-Call-'Em-Back, a cold-hearted man
Hoping I can reach Tamika cause she down with all of that
Smack her ass, pull her hair, she love to get it from the back
Hit me with a text sayin' that she wanna sex me
I told her, "Bring some lingerie" if she wanna impress me
Bitch, fuck all that talking, just get over here and neck me
She started reachin' for the door like she offended by the joke
Settin' her bra down on her bed and started kissing on her throat
Getting closer to the pussy, ready to get in this shit
Pull her panties to the side, and bitch is on her period
Tell me you ain't serious, this shit is priceless
Told her, "Get to sucking, bitch, and do it like you like it"
Dumbass broad is stupid but I wish I was a psychic
If I'd known she was bleedin' then she wouldn't have got invited
Got a nigga all excited, erectin' up my private

[Verse 2]
I can't get no pussy so right now I'm feelin' violent
I know you trying to go and hope your pussy got some malice
I'm dead-ass serious, bitch I ain't smiling
Then I hit her with the "what the fuck you mean 'no?'
I ain't trying to hear this shit
You ain't trying to suck the dick, then I'mma call the other bitch"
Acting like you ain't a dog, I know you let my cousin hit
Playing like you had to do it when you know you ain't shit
Nympho for the sex, can probably take eight dicks
Scrolling through these bitches like an iPod playlist
Ran across Jasmine, that redbone waitress
Ass like Trina with some lips like Megan
Good, classy broad but she still good
Layin' right under her man and I really wish she could
Come over and fuck me on my sofa
I'm almost out of options and I'm feelin' like it's over
For me to get some pussy cause it's almost a quarter to six and my
Hand in my dick, thinkin' about using my wrist
Pissed about this shit, I can't let it happen like this
Seen a call that I missed, and I hope that it's worth it
Hesitate to call her back cause she say she a virgin
But today you 'bout to learn how to bust that pussy open
I ain't jokin'

[Verse 3]
Heard a knock at the door, thankin' God like I'm spiritual
Hopin' that she wanna fuck, the situation critical
Gotta play my cards right and treat it like it's pivotal
Plus I'm drunk as hell and I'm a horny individual
Netflix on the couch, chillin' in the living room
Started kissing on her neck, she had the nerve to tell me move
I hit her with the stare face, "bitch, what you tryna do?"
She told me she just wanna chill
I told her, "oh, for real?
It's six o'clock in the morning, ho, and you know what it is
This ain't no talk-show, and you ain't look like Oprah
So hike that dress up like a sinner bitch and let me stroke ya"
I heard her suck her teeth, then she rolled the fuck over
Turned the TV off on her ass, hit her with the cold shoulder
This story far from over, and I am far from average
She say she practice abstinence, waitin' for the marriage
I told her "let me eat the pussy, we ain't gotta have sex"
Stop right before she came, her legs still around my neck
Now her ass drippin' wet, fiendin' for a cigarette
Ask me if I had a rubber, all I could think was yes
Ran her tongue down my neck, started suckin' on my meat
"Tell me 'fore you 'bout to come so I can spit it in the sheets"
Hit her with the OK, but you know how I do and freak
Before you know it I'm bustin', jizzin' all on her teeth
She punch me in the stomach, she mad, I guess it's time to go
Walked her to the door and said peace and fell asleep
(Bitch)[Chorus]

Clocking in clocking out, another day another dollar
You can't even pump your gas, without some niggas trying to holla

I just want you to know I noticed (4x)

You go to school And go to work. Cash your check then go home single parent all alone. God damn girl you strong

I just want you to know I noticed (4x)

[Verse 1]

It's 5 in the morning, and you ain't had no sleep
Cause your youngest baby teething, just 1 of your lil 3

Your baby dad is a statistic, another dead beat
Shit my daddy was the same, so my Moma raised me

But she still found a way, to overcome a break free
Working job after job, 1 or 2 or maybe 3

To put food on the table, making due with ends meet
So I know about that pain that you feeling, and it's deep

And he beat you like he's strong, but that really means he weak
Now your plotting for revenge, wanting to killem in his sleep

But shit we all humans, and ain't no body perfect
No I anit making excuse but that nigga just ain't worth it

This your last year of school, you're about to graduate
Lost some friends along the way, because their heart was full of hate

They mad cause you got that job, making more than what they make
Fuck them bitches, you don't need them any way

Family always wanting something, never call to tell you hey
Or to check up on your kids, or care to ask about your day

I just want you to know I notice...
You ain't alone, so anytime you want to talk don't hesitate just hit my phone

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

You threw on some yoga pants, that compliment your figure, just to run and grab some milk, you weren't worried about no nigga

But they always try and holler, but never step correct
Making comments bout your ass, showing blatin disrespect

But you always keep it real, and put them niggas back in check
They break their necks whenever they see ya, damn near causing wrecks

And that's when you're in you're scrubs, they ain't even seen you when you dressed
Got them kids wit no stretch marks, damn girl you blessed

Making moves on you own, you ain't worried you ain't stressed
Plus you never hit the club, cause you know it's full of mess

Trying to hold it in the road, and let GOD do the rest
Niggas throwing money at you, but you ain't even impressed

You clocking in clocking out, another day another dollar
You can't even pump your gas, without some niggas trying to holla

I just want you to know I noticed, you ain't alone
So any time you wanna talk don't hesitate just hit my phone

[Chorus]Lord, forgive me âcause the way Iâm living
They say what goes around comes around
Iâm gonna get whatâs coming to me
Guess Iâll be strapped up till they lay me down

And I done did too much to say
I never go to church and barely pray
Lately Iâve been going through some things
Hell, what the fuck Iâm supposed to say?

âCause I just had two baby boys
Iâm always calling their mamaâs out their name
When I get caught in my emotions
Lord, I swear Iâm tryna make a change

Ain't wrote my brother Tune in the month
But Iâm always texting with these hoes
Feel bad whenever he call my phone
He had a court and I ainât even show

And my little brother looking up to me
Lord, I swear I ainât no role model
My uncle a fucking alcoholic
Canât even eat unless he got a bottle

I been stressing about that money lately
It got me âbout to rob a fucking bank
And my mama fuck with bitches now
I could judge her, but I really canât

âCause the way Iâm living ainât no better
I said the way Iâm living ainât no better
I just got in beef with whatâs his name
So now Iâm riding strapped with my Beretta

Laying in my bed, canât get sleep
Eyes wide open and Iâm staring at the ceiling
99 problems but I really got a million
You don't know my struggle so don't tell me that you feel it
Spit it from the heart, I know they gonna feel it
I was born real so cowards gonna feel me
Watching my back âcause I know they wanna kill me
Donât go nowhere without my semi
Daddy was a killer so the bloodline in me
Heart of a lion even though a nigga skinny
Come to my hood and you gonna see plenty
Matchbox chevy with the hubcap missin'
Niggas on dope walk around all timid
Dope dealer pass through the hood in a Bentley
Never gave back to the hood where Iâm from
So the niggas from the block where Iâm from gonna get it
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Niggas get money and they act like bitches
Till they head get bust and they ass need stitches
Blinded by the greed so you better pay attention
Money don't make you real, my nigga
Better run a valuable motherfucking dollar
'Fore them hungry niggas break you of something proper
City of the Angels where they ride with them choppers
Eat, shit, sleep and even die with the chopper
I ainât got nowhere to go, my nigga
Got beat down to the floor, my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
âCause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well Iâmma tell y'all like my nigga tell me
While I see it well enough they never grow, my nigga

Laying in my bed, canât get sleep
Eyes wide open and Iâm staring at the ceiling
Never go to church and my mommaâs feeling hurt
Praying at night âcause she know that Iâm sinning
Best coming so you know I gotta get it
Money coming fast so you know thatâs how Iâm spending
I ain't got credit so the whips on me when I drop out work another day you rented
Unmarked car keep riding through the hood, with the Feds in the town and they might be in it
Niggas on tha westside just got bopped with a couple of 'em blocks so they might be snitching
Calling my phone, wanna talk about business
Ain't it fucked up because I smell something fishy
Everyone's fucked, tryna handle my business
Trigger finger itching and my eyeballs twitchin
All this work in the goddamn kitchen
Everytime I cook, a nigga get nauseous
Peepin out my blinds because the chopper feelin cautious
Runnin from the law, got a nigga so exhausted
That's all I know my nigga, ya'll hardhead and it shows my nigga
Money be the root of all evil, gotta watch your people sometimes you don't know them niggas
But that's how it goes my nigga, got beat down to the floor my nigga
Hurt so bad and it show, my nigga
They kept saying that I wouldn't be shit
âCause I grew up so poor, my nigga
Well Iâmma tell y'all like my nigga tell me
While I see it well enough they never grow, my nigga[Intro]
Lord forgive me cause the way I'm livin'
They said what goes around comes around
I'm gon' get what's comin' to me
Cause I'll be strapped up till they lay me down

[Verse]
And I didn't need to much to say
I never go to church and belly pray
Lately I've been going through some thangs
Hell what the fuck I'm 'posed to say
Cause I just had two baby boys
Mama was colored and Mama's at they name
When I get caught in my emotion
Lord I swear I'm trying to make a change
I ain't wrote my brother Tune in a month
But I'm always texting with these hoes
Feel bad whenever he call my phone
He had a quarter and it ain't even show
And my lil' brother looking up to me
But I swear I ain't a role model
My uncle a fucking 'nacoholic
Can't even eat unless he got a bottle
I've been stressing about that money lately
Got me about to rob a fucking bank
And my mamma fuck with bitches now
I could judge her but I really c'ain't
Cause the way I'm ain't no betta'
I said the way I'm living ain't no betta'
I just got in beef for what's his name
So I'm riding strapped with my Beretta
