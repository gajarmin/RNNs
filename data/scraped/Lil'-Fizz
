[Intro]
I'll be down 4 u baby
I'ma ride for u baby
I will be the one u need
I'll do anything u want me to

[Verse 1: Lil Fizz]
Sexy abs, with your hips to match
Apple bottom jeans wit your lil Gucci backpack
Don't stand there, admire my mac tac
Gift of gab, I never lacked that
In fact, when I whisper in your ears
I see your skin bump up
And the hairs on your arms jump up
I get the same feeling girl when I'm by your side
And when we kiss girl our souls collide
I can provide whatever you need
Just holla girl

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
Know how you got me on the line
But I can't stop thinking all the time
Boy where u be
Wanna be around u constantly
Give me that
No can't stand to go feelin
Before I'm even out the door baby
I wanna keep you there with me

[Bridge]
I'm that chick
What - no doubt
I'm that chick
Up or down
Don't even gotta say a thing
Cause I'll be down

[Hook]
I'll be down 4 u baby
I'ma ride for u baby
I will be the one u need
Give u anything u want
I'll be down 4 u baby
I'ma ride for u baby
I will be the one u need
I'll do anything u want me to

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Oow what u bet
I'll never let
Nobody else ever think they could come between
What we got between u and me
Cause baby boo u got it like that
And ain't no way I'm holdin it back no
Cause now I got u
And if feels good now to be with u

[B Verse]

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Fizz]]
I ain't tryin to get in your drawers
I'm a gentleman, I open doors
I'm ready and willin to give u more
Than the dude u was with before
It's automatic girl, you're the only one I adore
Long walks on the beach by the shore
U was all teeth when I came home from tour
I came off the plane with a teddy bear for u
With a card attached telling u I care for u
I'll be there for u
Girl you've proven yourself
I see your heart is with Fizz not the cause of my wealth
And u conduct yourself so smooth and classy
You respect Omarion, J Boog and Razz B
They all cosigned u and gave u thumbs up
That's all I needed
And this verse is summed up
And I'm ready to take u there
I gotta whole lotta love to share
I know you're down 4 me

[Bridge 2 (2X)]
I will give u anything
And I will do anything
Anything u want
Anything u want

[Verse 3: Lil Fizz]
I'm a D-O-G

It's hard tryna be F-I double Z
I'm the Jay Z of my generation
So sick I'm every hospital's number one patient
Girls be killin me with they fantasies
When all I really wanted was the GTD's
Two minutes of conversation then ya outta control
I'm a D-O-G, ain't no changin me

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
You think I didn't know you (You could be doggin me)
Tryna play me for a fool (I'm your new enemy)

I guess it didn't work
(I'm so, I'm so, I'm so)

[Hook]

You were tryna test me, and I'm so disappointed

Wanna be around you constantly

And if feels good now
To be with you
