[Hook]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild

Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon
Buck, bye tough guy, oh my god I’m so high
Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin
But what does it take to make a kid make a million children SLAM

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Sonsee]
I’m the nitty, nasty, gritty smashing, never slow gassing
Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
I’m a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
*hiccup* Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM

[Hook x4]

SLAM[Verse 1]
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the ho's wanna get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin to the picnic
But somethin's missin, wake up and stop dreamin
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park before two
And everybody know what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

[Verse 2]
In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
So I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took fo' hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin on the curb, for four fuckin hours dog
Thinkin bout my homie in the pen, lil boss hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin when I was sleepin
On them fools on the otherside who call themselve's creepin
But see sucka, gangs a nation crew
And everybody knows what the fuck we gon do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
(Sherm stick)

[Verse 3]
I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin go bullet lock it's ya birthday
My homie b.k., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them ho's wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
Niggas gettin bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin the muthafuckin cabbage patch
Niggas throwin up, it's a part of growin up
My piss test is straight, it ain't shit showin up
So duck, cause the next busta might be you
Now all y'all niggas know what my crew bout to do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip

Yeah, this for y'all niggas out there, and y'all bitches out there
Smokin that border, rest in peace big tray dogg, much love locHauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned!

Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
Its a mere party booster that will set things clear
It's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause it's really a small thing
But they're bitin' what I'm writin'
God it's great being the king
Some sound alright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones' tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said "Alert, hear this,"
Cleared his (?) throat and then began to persist
He said "Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist"
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back{*beeper goes off eight times*}

[Intro: Fredro Starr]
Aiyyo, fuckin bitches man.. (worrrrrd up)

Muh'fuckin hehahahh...

[stoned out conversation for 15 seconds]

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz]
If ya got a girl then you better believe
She got a, dick up her throat and a trick up her sleeve
But if ya don't take my word, take the word of another
I love my girl more than I love my own mother
Until I caught the bitch in bed fuckin' my brother
Now, pussy to me, is a stick and a bone
I fuck it and she suck it then I leave it alone
Then get out the crib 'fore her man come home

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
Ding dong, ring a ling a ling
Honey I’m home, scumbags and candy
Feelin damn dandy, crazy drunk off the brandy
Headed to the stairs, tip tip toe
With these squeaky ass stairs kid you gotta move slow
She wasn’t in the room, where could she be?
Wait a cotton pickin minute, I hear the TV
I slid to the den what did I see?
What you saw?
I seen a nigga hairy stink ass (word??)
And my girl on her knees (OHHH SHIT!)

[Verse 3: Suave]
A freak is a freak and a ho is a ho

A ho I had before was claimin love, I was blind see
You can say like Mary J., "Just Remind Me"
Was buggin when she started suckin fuckin peppermints
Blow jobs got better
How the hell you miss those hints?
I don’t know but then I got the shock that almost blocked me like an obstacle
My girl lip lock a niggas cock like a popsicle
Quick, my man flipped the silencer tip
Now let that dumb bitch go to hell and suck on the devil’s dick
Yep, you know money felt the steel
He should ate that pussy then it coulda been his last meal
So don’t let my girl suck your dick
Even if she’s suckin the next nigga dick

[Hook]
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
Suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)

Afficial Nastee Niguz (repeat 8X)

[Verse 4: Fredro Starr]
Picture this, picture that
Your girl’s holdin the next man’s glands and comes back tell you that “I love you”
Bacdafucup, break the fuck off

Smack the cum out your mother fuckin mouth

Cause it landed on my couch

[Hook]
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)

[Verse 5: Sticky Fingaz]
Sometimes I feel like a nut
It melts in your mouth, not in your butt
Oh andtell your girl to stop changing her lipstick
I’m startin to get rainbows around my dick
I got caught in the act, you pulled a gun, I gave chase
It ain’t my fault his bitch take in the face
Shit, she the one who found Jack, the black vagina finda
Hmmm big ain’t it, lick lick so good God I almost fainted
Suckin da next nigga dick

[Hook]
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (oh shit!)
She was suckin the nex niguh dick (worrd?)
She was suckin the nex niguh, suckin the nex niguh

She was suckin the nex niguh, suckin the nex niguh
Suckin the nex niguh dick

[Outro: Sticky Fingaz]
Fuck it I don't need ya, let the welfare feed ya (word up)
Non-thinkin, cum-drinkin.. (suck, dick)
Fuck you bitch![Fredro Starr]
I got struck by lightning and the thunder
Wilder than the shit from the tundra
No wonder
Help me up someone’s pullin me under
A scorcher, flame on the brain this is torture
Terrible, horrible sick shit I brought ya
Sacrifice the virgin, urbanized splurging
Split splice oper-fucking-ratin like a surgeon
Write rhymes that got shot up bullet holes in the paper
Escape the madness, Onyx the baddest yep
Souls of a soldier in the streets of survival
If you’re blinded by the blackness, here’s the gun to guide you
Fumble up crews, crumble up under pressure, god
It’s hard, fuck you broken tooth bitin’

[Hook: repeat 4X]
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey

[Sonne Seeza]
Come and just bust me feel the real shit
Drilled through your eardrum, hell yeah I’m fearsome
My equilibrium, is touched with the U.S.G., sickness
Contaminated with slickness
Filthy, nasty grungy facts of the wretched, I got it to flex it
Crazy desperate to set shit
Yeah son, keep ‘em on the run
If it wasn’t you too, then you musta been the one
It’s not a big case to erase who bass in my face
You’ll just waste ya time and blood so ya better play ya space
Cause if not some shit gonna get real stupid
And you and your man can’t troop it

[Hook]

[Fredro & Sonsee]
Ay you ya nasty ass, what’s up big fella?
Hey whatever whatever shit, the dirty desert dweller
Who said never? All in together
Now I’ma show you how the Afficial niggas fuck it up

[Hook]

[Sticky Fingaz]
One day I'mma rule the fuckin world, just mark my word
I've got the filthiest shit, human ears ever heard!
And even if you wash my mouth out with soap
I'll still be as disgusting and despicable!
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid!
My moms dropped me on my head, when I was a kid!
Back then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So unless it’s Armageddon somebody’s bound to get robbed
Watch out! This could be you I believe
With a gun in your face, it’s better to give than receive
I'm more than meets the eye, energize, make your blood pressure rise
Mad Face ain't no disguise!

[Hook: repeat 4X]
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey

Yeaaaaaaa!Aiyyo what about the hoes? (Hoes?)
Yeah you know, the hoes
This is for the nappy hoes, yaknowhatI'msayin?

All the hoes that wanna get scrappy, we gonna do it like this for ya
Check it one time

Chorus:
It’s just
Me and Jack, the black vagina finda (3X)
Me and Jack, it’s just me and Jack

Big DS:
I’m the mother fucker fuckin somebody’s daughter
Go down stairs, shake hands with the father
Say ya need a bag? No dad don’t bother
Excuse me mister sir but your daughter get the raw dick

Sticky Fingaz:
It’s not every day you get to be a genuine witness of the 1992 annual fuck fest
So take off your bra show ya breast, remove your dress
Yo what’s the matter hooker? Cat got ya tongue?
Or do you want my tongue to get your cat and get ya strung?
I got the whip-appeal plus chains and bats
And always wear hats when slippin into putty cats
Once it’s in there is no turnin back
Put ya feet to ya head till ya hear your bone crack
When bitches get dick they don’t know how to act
And once you black you never go back
I don’t discriminate and just leave it at that
I’m just one stinky kinky slim, not slinky
Fiddle with ya clitoris then pop your pussy with my pinky
Try to get yours, I’m tryin to get mine-a
It’s just me and Jack, the black vagina finda

Chorus:
Just
Me and Jack, the black vagina finda (3X)
Me and Jack, it’s just me and Jack

Those perverted motherfuckaz is at it again (3X)
Fuckin with a skin, fuckin with her friend

Fredro:
Mickey Billy's in like a stranger, the slick dick pussy banger, titty strangler
Rougher than a wrangler guaranteed to make ‘em bleed
They need pain for satisfaction
Big butt cheeks, the funky freaks seek action
Pimpin the hoes, smackin the hoes, leavin em on a subway
Lost without a token, can’t walk cause that ass is broken
First date veteran, better than a nympho
Sleek to the beat cause I be fuckin on tempo
Train like a trolley, lickin like a lolly
Smoke more cheeba than mother fuckin Bob Marley
Lady persuader, pink panty raider
Four times a week I get stuck in the elevator
La la, live to die, trick for the slick, I went way past the Y
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
He got too slick, now he got a sick dick
Cause I don’t really really give a fuck
Praise the lord cause even nuns get stuck
Never play me like a burger, I’m never double cheesy
EZ-Wider, all righter
Sneaky type of fighter
Try to get yours cause I know I’ma get mine-a
Me and Jack, the black vagina finda

It's just
Me and Jack, the black vagina finda (3X)
It's just me and Jack, just me and Jack
Me and Jack (4X)

Ya don't stop
And ya don't quit
We're gonna be fuckin some bitches kid...
Word is bond...
Word, to the hoes, with the fat pussies, cunts...(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back ... (the Onyx is here!)
Back up, back up (the Onyx is here!)

Chorus: Onyx (repeat 2X)

(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back .. the Onyx is here!
Back up, back up .. the Onyx is here!

[Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah make way for the wild child
Stop screamin, you're fiendin
Play that, say that, dip dive socialize
Uncivilized guys rise up
Hip hop underrated the way they stated gets me hated
Back up, back off, lick shot for the street smarts
Onyx is the antidote for all your problems
Gimme a hit
Damn, don't it feel good

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Yup, I know you love to hate it, but you cannot explain
Why you keep puttin madface in your veins
Oooh, yeah, there, I got it
Afficial Nastee psychotic

[Fredro Starr]
Spies got spotted
So travel through the mind of a maniac automatic
You panic get stranded, a nigga on the planet

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Feel the black stone hit ya dome, roam in the desert
My chrome fills and skills to put chills in ya backbone

Chorus 2X

[Fredro & Sonsee]
1-to-the-9-to-the-9-to-the-3, solid as a rock!
So back up off the block, blow up the spot
So left-right-left-right
Take it to the center, and enter
The black reign domain, a plane you never been to
And you know what this is what?
Face down on the floor
Give me it all, I got they back against the wall

Chorus 2X

[Sticky Fingaz]
Don't be afraid, you'll only lose your life that way
I'm an endangered species, surprised to live to see today
But if you're readin between the enemy line you'll find I'm insane
Too much strain on the brain, capable to pop a vein
So I'ma do-it do-it do-it do-it do it like this
Now Onyx is here, so back up or get dissed
And if you put me to the test, I'll lay you to rest
Bring it right to his chest, put it straight through his vest

Chorus 2.5X

Back, UP!!!  Onyx is here..[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
If the heat is on I gotta freeze a frontin' nigga
Shit’ll hit the fan from the hand squeeze the trigger
Attack of the bald heads, sleep if ya wanna
Beds is burned, step to this you’ll be a goner
Bitch ass niggas not respected but neglected
Move on ‘em, move on ‘em things’ll get hectic
So watch ya pockets, hold ya ho
Ya get hurt up, that’s the word up, fuckin’ with Fredro
Understand god damn, who the hell is that little ass man?
The kid with the scams for all the tight jams
Shootin at the stands, sometimes I grease the fans
Ain’t nothin worse than a bitch ass or which ass nigga that's fakin, lies for attention'
Try to ride a nut for a scratch so stop itchin
Wishin perhaps I play the right guard
Tryin to gain yards but I’ma hit ya with sacks
Two to the temple straight to the brain
So simple and plain
Ain’t a mother fuckin thing change but a hole in ya motherfuckin tank
I would like to thank my nigga
My nigga
My nigga
My nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga

[Hook x2]
Bichasniguz I'mma have to pull ya skirt up!
Bichasniguz I'mma have to pull ya skirt up!
Bichasniguz I'mma have to pull ya skirt up!
That's da word up, you get hurt up!

[Verse 2: Big DS]
Big DS, I’ll put a hole in ya chest
Grab ya by the neck, I hit you with the tek
Onyx in effect, we always come correct
Smack the taste out ya motherfuckin mouth
Big DS I show ya what it’s all about
Danger danger, danger danger
It’s all about anger, the nigga bitch banger

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Sonsee]
I be with the crazy criminals from the pistol projects
Beatin ‘em down, who we suspect to fake moves
They play the bitch ass, your choice is dead or death you choose
Make a bitch nigga silent as a bad case of strep throat
Wild crazy klepto keepin ‘em all petro
Duck kids on the block gettin hot with the rocks when the time hit the clock
I knock ‘em right out they Reeboks
That’s my word
I hit a slick city kid or a herb from the suburbs
Bullets can’t discriminate so I won’t either
Make you holier than a bible if you not a believer
This ya worst dream when ya face my team
Bend a bitch nigga over like the house of pain make ‘em scream
When I get you I say gimme that bitch ass
Slice ya throat with glass, get you a cast or a ditch fast

[Onyx]
Ain't nuthin' worse than a bitch ass nigga!
Ain't nuthin' worse than a bitch ass nigga!

[Verse 4: Sticky Fingaz]
Move back mother fuckers, the Onyx is here
My name is Sticky Fingaz I’m the nigga in your nightmare
Forget the crowd cheers, I live off fears
It’s the beast in me, even the music couldn’t sooth me
It’ll take more than U-Haul if ya tryin’ to move me
Ya see I wrote the rhyme, but it’s the weed talkin
All ya bitch ass niggas best just keep walkin
Before I spit in ya face
Onyx is the master race
Ain’t nothing sweet about me G so stay in a child’s place
With God as my witness, I broke the law
And had bitch ass niggas in jail washin my drawers
Hit the floors and do crazy calisthenics
Then when they try to flip they take a trip to the paramedics
Cause ain’t nothin worse than a bitch ass nigga
Talk a lot of shit, throw a punch and run
I have blood on my knife and a body on my gun
So listen up son, don’t act wild or I’ll cramp ya style with a bullet and a smile
Cause ain't nuthin worse than a bichasnigga!
Ain't nuthin worse than a bichasnigga!
Ain't nuthin worse than a bichasnigga!
Ain't nuthin worse than a bichasnigga!
Ain't nuthin worse than a bichasnigga!
That's the WORD up, you get HURT up!!!Aiyyo what about the hoes? (Hoes?)

Ah yeah! We gonna do it for all my kids..

[Fredro Starr]

Murder murder, who the hell heard a young black nigga like me gettin off scot-free
Murder murder, me never have peace, me always jump fare
We watch for the beast
Dead body over there, dead body over there
Everywhere a dead body dead body everywhere
So well oh well, oh fuck it, two tears in a bucket
40s spillin over in the tummy of a dummy
Statue at you, but don’t break my cipher
Smoker, still the most iller for the filler
Or just you might stop fogging up my glasses
Guns for fun, my son I’ll hit you like a chalice
Bang, let it hang out, you get the penis
Sorry for your stitches, the inconvenience
Or would you will stand still, my aim is kind of fucked up
Like the killer diller puff the stuff we got blunted up
Load it up, change the clip
Fire when you see the bloody red in they eye
Yeah it's time to survive

[Hook]

Nigga Bridges fallin' down, they fallin' down, they fallin' down
Nigga Bridges fallin' down, MUTHAFUCKAZ IS ACTING CRAZY!

[Sonsee]

I catch vics for trips, watch Sonee flips on bitch ass nigga geeks with ill freaks and sheik clothing
Diamonds shining, pockets bulging
Saw a guy and a girl with pearls around her collar
Sticky stuck the tek in her mouth so she couldn’t holler
We rollin for dollars
Mickey said three pounds seven in the man’s head
One move you’re dead
Dug out they pockets as if I had a shovel
Movin on the double cause we ain’t tryin to see trouble
Dreamin and schemin it’s gonna be a bloodbath
Got a Smith and Wesson autograph for your whole staff
A stick up a day keeps the pockets OK
A hit and run before you see another day
Cause the USG is where I stay

[Onyx, (Fredro Starr)]

MURDER MURDER! (Ya life's on the line)
MURDER MURDER! (Here's a bullet for ya mind)
MURDER MURDER! (I'm out doin' crime)
MURDER MURDER! (But me never do time)

[Big DS]

You dirty motherfuckin rat
Ha-cha-cha-cha now they got me on the lie detector
Why? Cause I killed the inspector
Resurrection, you need pork protection
Bridges burnin, your bitches I’m sexing
So damn crazy now they got me in correctional facilities (WHAT?!)
Why? Cause they can’t get with these wild juvenile Meanwhile in trial, I’m heading for Penal
Feelin senile, lost my mind when I was out doin' crime
Got shit locked down but never been locked up
All the time you get fucked for a buck
And motherfuckers is acting crazy

[Hook]

[Sticky Fingaz]

You done fucked with the wrong nigga brother
You’ll rather fuck your mother plus bust a cap for her lesbian lover
Bullets ricochet, you lay and pray for your maker
Two in the heart, a clip in the head
Read the obituary; used to live in Brooklyn now you rest in a cemetery
It’s a full moon, I get a chill in my spine
Decrease the population with my nickel plated nine
You bloodclot warrior, Rasta imposter
Everybody want to go to heaven but nobody want to die why?
Me do not know
See ya in the next life, buddy boy

[Hook] (2x)

[Outro]

Yeah muthafucka! Fucked up! BACK-DA-FUCK-UP!
You get hurt up! It's the Onyx man! That's my word!
Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck anything! Fuck ya momma, ya father![ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
I knew I was gone before they even put the handcuffs on
A whole chicken in the back of the Brougham
Rocked up, so I knew that I was locked up
Got a good lawyer but can't do nothin for ya
But they got chronic, I chills and get my puff on
Eat Ramen, hit my fifi, lift weights and get my buff on
These hoochies are trippin but I expect that, see
All on another fool's jock but they can't get a dime from me
But you my gee, see, and we supposed to be tight
So why the fuck you didn't send me no kite?
I been down for two and ain't heard a thing from you
See, that ain't the thang to do, let's keep this bangin true, blue
If it was you, you would want me to do the same thing
How you gon' slip and leave your homie on the hang?
I gots no time for you busters and you snitches
This is for the real - niggas and the bitches

[ VERSE 2: Jayo Felony ]
I had a down one, she kept my books on fat
We used to do it like this, then we would do it like that
This is for the real, to hell with the faker
I was on my bunk bed bumpin Anita Baker
Wishin I was in a hot thub gettin my back rubbed
Instead of bein in here with 4'000 thugs
I remember all the letters you wrote and the cards you sent
And them ends when you had to pay rent
But you would always get yours and couldn't nothin stop ya
Tight Guess and K-Swiss lookin proper
And you were proud to be Ms. Bullet Loco
Fool, don't phantasize off my foto
Even though you knew I was mackin you still stuck with me
Remindin me to stay sucker free
And when I touched down you kickin in straight riches
This is for the real - niggas and the bitches

[ VERSE 3: Jayo Felony ]
And now I'm fresh out, I was a C but they doubt me
Much love to the bitches that didn't forget about me
Because I surely won't forget about you
And everybody knows what the fuck I'm gon' do
Blow up from the flo' up, grow up and don't be to' up
The hoes that tried to clown, I diss them hookers like throw-up
I'm tryin to learn to keep my black ass on the streets
No more shackles on my feet
Makin funky hits like this I can't miss
Jam-Master Jay and T-Funk and my nigga Cool Chris
So when I'm at a picnic gettin my mob on
Don't walk up on me, we might have to get our squab on
And my female got a mouthpiece
Protection for the wicked streets of Southeast
My day is too short for you marks and you snitches
This is for the real - niggas and the bitches(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back ... (the Onyx is here!)
Back up, back up (the Onyx is here!)

Chorus: Onyx (repeat 2X)

(Onyx, Onyx..) Move back .. the Onyx is here!
Back up, back up .. the Onyx is here!

[Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah make way for the wild child
Stop screamin, you're fiendin
Play that, say that, dip dive socialize
Uncivilized guys rise up
Hip hop underrated the way they stated gets me hated
Back up, back off, lick shot for the street smarts
Onyx is the antidote for all your problems
Gimme a hit
Damn, don't it feel good

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Yup, I know you love to hate it, but you cannot explain
Why you keep puttin madface in your veins
Oooh, yeah, there, I got it
Afficial Nastee psychotic

[Fredro Starr]
Spies got spotted
So travel through the mind of a maniac automatic
You panic get stranded, a nigga on the planet

[Sonee Seeza/Sonsee]
Feel the black stone hit ya dome, roam in the desert
My chrome fills and skills to put chills in ya backbone

Chorus 2X

[Fredro & Sonsee]
1-to-the-9-to-the-9-to-the-3, solid as a rock!
So back up off the block, blow up the spot
So left-right-left-right
Take it to the center, and enter
The black reign domain, a plane you never been to
And you know what this is what?
Face down on the floor
Give me it all, I got they back against the wall

Chorus 2X

[Sticky Fingaz]
Don't be afraid, you'll only lose your life that way
I'm an endangered species, surprised to live to see today
But if you're readin between the enemy line you'll find I'm insane
Too much strain on the brain, capable to pop a vein
So I'ma do-it do-it do-it do-it do it like this
Now Onyx is here, so back up or get dissed
And if you put me to the test, I'll lay you to rest
Bring it right to his chest, put it straight through his vest

Chorus 2.5X

Back, UP!!!  Onyx is here..[Verse 1]
On fo' seven, the helicopter lights nearly blind me
In the south east streets is were you might find me
True bandana, my scanner, and my pager
In the blue 1994 one blazer
And I'm the one all the ho's wanna get wit
Jack Daniel punch and the indo spliff
You don't like the way I kick shit
You can get the dick six fo' three wheelin
Mobbin to the picnic
But somethin's missin, wake up and stop dreamin
Tyshe let's take a ride to the coast to get a demon
Bring it back to Gomper's Park before two
And everybody know what the fuck we gon' do

[Chorus]
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit (we gon smoke a sherm stick)
We gon smoke a dip, all of it
Not a little bit, we gon smoke a dip (sherm stick)

[Verse 2]
In the men's bathroom, fool let me have room
So I light it right, so it won't go boom
I took fo' hard hits, and passed it to the next man
Now it seems like I got powers like the X-men
Sittin on the curb, for four fuckin hours dog
Thinkin bout my homie in the pen, lil boss hog
Damn near dead, bout to head to the tilt
My homegirl woke me up, wit a carton of milk
I'm glad I didn't get caught slippin when I was sleepin
On them fools on the otherside who call themselve's creepin
But see sucka, gangs a nation crew
And everybody knows what the fuck we gon do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
(Sherm stick)

[Verse 3]
I flips the ill gangsta shit on the worst day
Bitches sayin go bullet lock it's ya birthday
My homie b.k., threw a party and we got there late
You know I had to make them ho's wait
And when I arrived, the whole shit was in a trance
Niggas gettin bong out, muthafucka a dance
Haha, gettin ready for the next batch
My homie's asshole naked, doin the muthafuckin cabbage patch
Niggas throwin up, it's a part of growin up
My piss test is straight, it ain't shit showin up
So duck, cause the next busta might be you
Now all y'all niggas know what my crew bout to do

[Chorus]

Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip
Everybody that like to fuck, throw ya hands up, we gon smoke a dip

Yeah, this for y'all niggas out there, and y'all bitches out there
Smokin that border, rest in peace big tray dogg, much love loc[Fredro Starr]
I got struck by lightning and the thunder
Wilder than the shit from the tundra
No wonder
Help me up someone’s pullin me under
A scorcher, flame on the brain this is torture
Terrible, horrible sick shit I brought ya
Sacrifice the virgin, urbanized splurging
Split splice oper-fucking-ratin like a surgeon
Write rhymes that got shot up bullet holes in the paper
Escape the madness, Onyx the baddest yep
Souls of a soldier in the streets of survival
If you’re blinded by the blackness, here’s the gun to guide you
Fumble up crews, crumble up under pressure, god
It’s hard, fuck you broken tooth bitin’

[Hook: repeat 4X]
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey

[Sonne Seeza]
Come and just bust me feel the real shit
Drilled through your eardrum, hell yeah I’m fearsome
My equilibrium, is touched with the U.S.G., sickness
Contaminated with slickness
Filthy, nasty grungy facts of the wretched, I got it to flex it
Crazy desperate to set shit
Yeah son, keep ‘em on the run
If it wasn’t you too, then you musta been the one
It’s not a big case to erase who bass in my face
You’ll just waste ya time and blood so ya better play ya space
Cause if not some shit gonna get real stupid
And you and your man can’t troop it

[Hook]

[Fredro & Sonsee]
Ay you ya nasty ass, what’s up big fella?
Hey whatever whatever shit, the dirty desert dweller
Who said never? All in together
Now I’ma show you how the Afficial niggas fuck it up

[Hook]

[Sticky Fingaz]
One day I'mma rule the fuckin world, just mark my word
I've got the filthiest shit, human ears ever heard!
And even if you wash my mouth out with soap
I'll still be as disgusting and despicable!
Unpredictable, liable to flip my lid!
My moms dropped me on my head, when I was a kid!
Back then I lost all my marbles, today I lost my job
So unless it’s Armageddon somebody’s bound to get robbed
Watch out! This could be you I believe
With a gun in your face, it’s better to give than receive
I'm more than meets the eye, energize, make your blood pressure rise
Mad Face ain't no disguise!

[Hook: repeat 4X]
Shiftee! Low down, gritty and grimey

Yeaaaaaaa![Hook]
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh
Make noise b-boys

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild

Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon
Buck, bye tough guy, oh my god I’m so high
Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin
But what does it take to make a kid make a million children SLAM

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Sonsee]
I’m the nitty, nasty, gritty smashing, never slow gassing
Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
I’m a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
*hiccup* Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM

[Hook x4]

SLAM[Intro: Onyx -Fredro Star-]
Oh shit.. yo, y'knahmsayin?
That shit just shot duke in the face
(That nigga right there!)
Nigga gotta be dead..
Fuck that then, let's rob that nigga man
Take that nigga watch and get the fuck out of here
(Fuck him!)
-Aiyo, young brothers out there
Shouldn't be sticking up people y'know?-

[Verse 1: Sonee Seeza]
Gimme the money, gimme the money
Here comes Sonee the greaser
Seize the hostages my conscience keeps tellin me I should just
Hit em high, hit em low everywhere I go
There’s no coppers could stop us
The pros; our motto is

[Hook]
Stick and move (4X)

[Verse 2: Fredro Starr]
8 o’clock in the morning time to wake up
Another brother getting paid in a way it’s a stick up
No time to even take a bath
Strictly cash tax free quick fast
Grab my Polo, jumped in the Timberland boots
I got Audi, time to get rowdy
Shiftee, low down gritty and grimy
I guess I got to find my crimey
Sticky Fingaz, yo that Sticky Fingaz
Jetted to the ave in a half of a second
He wasn’t at the spot so the stop I was checkin
Met him on the way, tucked away was the weapon

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Single handed me and Mickey Billy took a trip to Linden
Picked up some cheeba and brew, yo what else we need?
Nothin’
Now we on the E train back to Archer and Sutphin
Oops, it's our stop, the 40-deuce get loose
See three other trooper and they tried to call a truce
One had a link, the other a goose
You know what we took and you know what we left
But the third one played a punk, he dissed his posse and stepped
With Sticky on the loose there was nothing he could do
So I pulled out the old taped-up .22
But that was only petty, skills a Philly get ready

[Hook]

[Verse 4 Fredro Starr]
Yeah, yeah; hand over the money
Don’t get like “doc what’s up doc?” This is Muggs Bunny, ain’t nuttin’ funny, ha it’s a stick up
Sticky got sticky and tricky with the wallet, but this ain’t El Segundo
It's just the four, bad, brothers from the ghetto

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sticky Fingaz]
We had an option after 12 in the city
Man we gonna roll on some Chez Whitey nitty
But first we got trips because the man got geased
Yo mister I just got robbed, have you seen the police?
“Nah, none over here”
Good, so run all your gear
Rolex watch, rings, the Gucci underwear
You might think I’m sorta outta order but I’ll rob you for a quarter
Chez Whitey you’s a goner
You’s a gonna wanna call the pork, pig, ya dig, police, peace

[Hook]

[Outro: Fredro Starr]
Aiyyo, young brothers out here

Yeah yeah, hand over the moneyHauk, who goes yonder?
It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham
Well, speak up man, what is it?
News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned!

Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
Its a mere party booster that will set things clear
It's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now in these times, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause it's really a small thing
But they're bitin' what I'm writin'
God it's great being the king
Some sound alright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't be conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones' tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said "Alert, hear this,"
Cleared his (?) throat and then began to persist
He said "Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist"
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's backMove back motherfuckers - the ONYX is here

12 noon in the hood, Hennessy on the rocks, that is my potion
Bitches singin that sad love song like Billy Ocean
But to them hoochie hoodrats (I) give em no leeway
So now I'm peelin out hittin switches on a freeway
Leanin to the side (right) bouncin when I hit a dip
Slowin down so my CD won't skip
When trip I'm pullin up on all-gold D's
The orange bud is sticky, crack a forty with the O.G.'s
And it was cool until they put me up on the scoop:
"Yo Loc, I saw your main bitch in a coupe
Whooptie-whoop and they were goin to the mo-mo"
So I'm thinkin: Oh no, it's time to roll to the pad and get my .44
No ho is worth another case, get out my face
As I bring it to the table like grace
Bitch, and I want nothin else to do with you
Speed on, hurry up and get gone because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right

Not givin a damn about a punk bitch, it's all about the sex, man
Cause if the Loc take a fizzall you're goin to the next man
Prraw, prraw, prraw, that's how my toolie sound
When I pullin off on her
Cause I don't want her
You know what I'm sayin?
I wasn't born with that bitch
And I ain't gon die with that bitch
And I tell that bitch to split quick
And prraw sounds I make out the pipes on my muthafuckin 64
But let me get back on this bitch, though
My O.G.'s raised me to never ever let them hoes plays me
I pray that you save me, they pushin up daisies
Cause if I caught you in bed with Ted and Fred
That still wouldn't make me put no strap to my head
Bullet Loc stayin tall, though, through it all, though
Some of y'all ain't good for nothin but a bootie call, though
Yo, so I'm off in the wind and stayin true
Speed on, hurry up and get gone because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right

There's a pijama party goin down...
Fool, you should know that I'm with that
The baddest hoes in the world want the Bullet Loc to hit that
I'm on the prowl, I'll be the one gettin my stroke on
I never hesitates to get my loc on
Ugh, get my smoke on ,but you know that's only right, though
The po-po wanna know why my eyes low
But I got a surprise, though
Pedal to the flo', that's how I peel out
Drink won't spill out, chill out and let my crop sprout
I'm out it's on ( ? ) takin it easy
Bitch, don't try to hide when you see me
Your game is wack, so stay the fuck back
I drop you off at the bus stop to give that horse his tail back
You been dismissed, dissed like snotty tissue
Get outta here, disappear bitch, but I won't miss you
And they all know what a real gee'll do with you
Straight give the boot to that ass because I'm through with you

For the past, decade..
And the last, ten years..
Many reps were made..
Many debts were paid!
Some CREWS, paid DUES..
Others REFUSED, to LOSE..
And that's ALLLLLLLLLLLLL, the NEWS!We get open! (8X)

[Run]
I seen you hopin and scopin I'm copin as I get you wide open
Dyin and lyin while you're cryin and mopin
Flippin and rippin money-grippin be gropin
The baddest apparatus got the fad as I'm open
I never slip or fell, I raise up ?? well
I bash you in your bell, you got static in hell
And when you seen the fire you got jealous, you jeal'
So sucker just retire, you admire my skill
I'm never the type of guy to close the door in your face
I got you wide open, Run is runnin a race
Takin what's mine and what's left is a waste
Leavin them behind and all suckers on the chase
Got a dope track, comin real dope an'
I get legit, we get, I get..

We get open! (14X)
We get..

[Jam Master Jay]
Word up!
I freak the beat up, boom! Now bass up, pick the pace up
Jam Master blastin through the plaster cause I has ta
Hard rocks like to rock it, you can't stop it
?? Poll in ten years, I'mma walk away a prophet ??
You don't stop, I stop styles in the attic
Kick the fat flavor that you can't be mad at
?? what's the matter, more mix in granny's batter
Run-D.M.C.'s fatter, so kill the chit-chatter
Zigga zigga Jay, jigga jigga pump pump
Gettin bigger Babe Pah, figure nigga freak the funk
3 in the Head, ten yards to go
Blow up the spot for those that forgot
Stay stable as a navel, try an' rhyme rough and able
(With the Baldhead Kidz!) Word up, blow up the label
Boom boom boom, broke-in, got ya jok-in
Me, Run and D, we're gettin open!

We get open! (16X)
We get..

[D.M.C.]
Open the door, let me in
So my rhyme, can now begin
Forget the hit and all the (shit)
That you used to get with, because it's not legit
I rewrote the script, I flip the ship
I bust a lip, it's time to rip the mic I grip
Darryl McDan', use abuse
I bruise the crews, I refuse to lose
My composure, I will bulldoze ya
A froze enclosure, where no one knows ya
Who dat - who flew that head, well it's said
D put the head to bed and you're dead
Moms is cryin, MC's is dyin
I'm knockin down jaws with paws, like a lion
I wrote the dope quotes, now the punks is scopin
I knuckle up and punch and bust his fronts open

We get open! (8X)

South East San Diego in the muthafuckin house
619
Gangsta Nation crew, nigga
Bullet Loco
So get your muthafuckin facts straight
Check it out

[ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
What that Diego like? A Uzi or a Mack 10
Bullet Loco and I'm bailin with my niggas from the pen
These snitches and tricks makin the set look real bad
Instead of that rag, buster, you need a badge
I gotta watch the pad real close for the break-in
Cause suckers be fakin but it'll be no more mistakin
Hand-pick my click, no weak link or busters
Just pimps and murderers and straight up hustlers
Who ain't givin a fuck about a nine to five
When I can pull up on ya, blast that ass and then drive
Your car away, far away and leave you with a frame
Sittin on bricks and that's a muthafuckin shame
You don't know my name or the set that I claim
For years I let embalmin fluid take over my brain
Killin over colors, fuck if it's my brother
But if I hesitate on he draw I might not see another
Day, some say ( ? ) smokin and I start chokin them bricks
And I'm pissin on your floor cause I ain't housebroken, bitch
They snitched on the Loc when I was bangin
But now on my nuts you're hangin
And I just ask myself

Yeah muthafucka

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

Nigga

[ VERSE 2: Jayo Felony ]
You must be on caine, speed, water, weed, hot cock or ready rock
It's the Bullet Loco on the 47 block
On a mission as I'm gettin Inside like Edition
Bitches are wishin they could be huggin up and kissin
Me, but see Bullet Loco gon' stand with the upper hand
Hookers be lyin like the muthafuckin weatherman
Bitch, it ain't gon rain, it's a sunny day
For my AK to spray and lay any hooker that wants to play play
Taytay your baby kids were up and saw me fuckin you
Beatin up the poo-poo with my dick stuck in you
I might smoke anyone when I'm swimmin in the water
( ? ) to San Diego news reporters
( ? ) puttin out a fuckin hit
Suck my dick, you'se a trick, your perspective ain't shit
To my click I flick a shermstick bud in your eye
Bangin till I die
Nigga

Yeah fool
And it don't stop

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

[ VERSE 3: Jayo Felony ]
My little homies walk the streets strapped ready to peel a cap
So my enemy's gone on a muthafuckin map
Six feet deep, his boys might try to creep
I don't sleep, I keep my trigger finger on my heat
Huh, and sho' enough here they come on a sneak tip
But I got a AK-47 with a 50 round clip
Buck - I hit the driver and he crashed
Ran up on em busters and let em have it as I blast
Tic toc, you don't stop, mama smokin crack rock
Break that shit pipe and tell that ho to stop
But on my block you got them ends, you got the lleyo
My kids got a appetite, so I just can't say no
I'm cuttin up my brick just as soon as I can buy it
I even got a sample of, here smoke and try it
It's all about the street life, my knife and my rag
The Loc used to sag even when I played tag
Fuck the drag, here I come with the gun, son
Blast that ass, question later, I ain't the one
Toss up the Thunderbird, never leave a homie hangin
Cause Bullet Loc ain't goin out, fool...

And I just ask myself
Muthafucka

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

You must be on dope, nigga
Yeah and it don't stop

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

You must be on dope, bitch
