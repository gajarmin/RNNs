[Verse One] [Statik Selektah]:
The best
And that's word to my momma
2010 ain't no more drama
Word to Obama, a new day dawnin'
I wake up to make beats every mornin'
Head bangin' from last night
Still got jet lag from that last flight
Still got bloody knuckles from that last fight
And we the best in the world, that's right

[Reks]:
ShowOff
We most official, win it when we pen it
We tendin' to kill 'em with it
The lyric will spill if ain't best in the world
Never timid, never shy
Seventh hour with the best of my
Iller lyrics why try
Contestin', been a minute, I'm in it to win it
I'm a be lieutenant
My spittin' are realer image
Y'all lie, y'all die
Y'all cry faggotty, Raggedy Ann rappers be lackin'
In the back of seats tryin' to steer
Horror here, time to fear
Kali, JFK, Termanology, R.E.K.S. beyond y'all
Blah blah, Statik is a don y'all
Hangover like an encore y'all don't want war
Y'all bitch, y'all snitch, y'all just
Rob jars take pennies
My niggas, can we just make dope shit
So sick, like Manny
Homie on the juice, Corey in the booth
Family
Pass the deuce deuce and the Henny
And can we

[Termanology]:
Well I'm Termanology I got bitches galore
You might have a lot of bitches but I got much more
With my super duper group comin' out this year
ShowOff motherfuckers, cold knockin' the boots
Reks, JFK, Term, Kali and all of us
You don't wanna spar with us
Lyrically you get swallowed up
Give them ? and rock, come spit a bar with us
Punk we spit phenomenal, uh meet us at the top

[JFK]:
From Stick 2 The Script to Spell My Name Right
Yeah, we that same clique, come too game tight
We sacrifice your head, to spit classic shit
Keepin' the show live, until the casket dips
We worldwide
Around the world in a day
Continue to flood the streets
Take over the airwaves
It's Politics As Usual, Hangover is here
Who you know is six albums deep in the last three years?

[Kali]:
Too many cups of Henny
Not enough weed
Too many fuckin' pennies
But not enough G's
To many late nights, bright lights, Cali trees
Too many rappers, not enough MCs
Too many actors in the place but I'm established
So we just keep our distance
Like a bad marriage
There's no comparison cause they average
This is magic, way beyond classic
Do you cause we gon' keep doin' us
Nobody can ruin us, tell 'em stop pursin' us
They'll never catch us, we're way beyond pass gone
They jottin' down all the lyrics from my last song
Put your hands up
I know I make it hard to breathe
We tear the club down I know we make it hard to leave

Cause we the best in the world[Intro]
"Oh, it's you again! Don't you ever give up?"
"At one time I thought of giving up, but now I think differently"
"You can help change things, by learning more about your culture"
"and believing in yourself."
"Oh yeah? You gotta be joking."
"It's no joke. Tell me!"

[Reks]
I'mma write this here rhyme like Guru's in the passenger
Standin on the East coast, starin out to Africa
Accolades, Escalades fade
My vernacular remain in tact for the generation that's comin after
The average rapper you praise days numbered like a calendar
Challengers caliber mediocre enter the catheter
IV's, wrap 'em up, mad as fuck, need a ladder up
Escalator, elevator, skyscraper, hella haters
On Primo beats, meditate a bit to elevate my spit
Scribble daily scripts, hell in wit
Angels I strangle the instrument mangle chop can't go pop
I gotta remain boom bap, true dat, who dat be?
Mr. 'Say Goodnight,' I'mma blaze the mic willingly
Kill or be killed industry, and the realest of the real emcees
Solo flow enemy, future of the rap
Golden Era dead {"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
We in the 25th hour, it's now or never
We gotta get it 'fore it's gone forever, remember
In the end time waits for no man, what's your plan?
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Reks]
Before I fade to black, face the mirror, face the fact
Fate appear to backtrack where the plaques at?
Where the love for the cat?
Fortified flow, fire from fire like fame
Foresayer in Josiah desire to perspire
The 25th hour upon me, calmly walk the wire
Annihilate enemy ire any higher than I are in the sky
Or heaven I require less than mediocre
I reawoken the deeper thoughts of sleepin prophets
Regardless of others offers I authentic dialect, I'm a vet
Y'all are just wakin up, 'Say Goodnight'
Slap a rapper, take his mic, greater height
Spit a rhyme saber like
Inner mind paid the price, A-B-C-alike
Hey Preem, we a tight, chemistry
Any beats sent to me I'mma instantly write
'til the fingertips crippled
It'll be sort of arthritis to finish a line
If you more than rhyme this
{"No time for looking back, it's done"}

[Hook]

[Reks]
You ever chant with the rebels, dance with the devils?
Answered the higher levels, ride with the iron elbow to elbow
In hellish circles where the heat is echoed
You ever let go, stresses from pressures boilin beyond the kettle?
You ever petrified, exorcised demons
Believing you leave 'em breathin they'll get even
Odds are beyond y'all, achievin peaceful means of seekin deacons
Ain't no way out, they 'bout beat, by any means
Ain't necessary but they bury them very young, hell or heaven
Them adolescents, is pedalin, packin metal and settlin
Street wars, revolves life behind tight walls
When I falls, psychos strike the right chords
They at pause, bumpin Ricky Ross
Kids is on crack, they lost
Wipe a lot, no time for looking back, it's done
Golden era over and dead, I'm over your HEADS~!

Nobody, nobody
Me against the world, trust it’s no party
‘Cause all that glitters ain’t gold
So I’ve been told
Been down them lonely roads where the nights get cold
When we was kids we used to say
“Oh the places we’ll go
Oh the places we’ll go
We’ll go so many places”

[Hook: Sample of Hope’s “The Rain Don’t Last” (+Reks)]
Could it be the world’s grown colder? (So cold)
Maybe I’m a losing soul (Well maybe I can’t win)
The more I try, it just gets harder (So hard)
And my pain is getting old
Somebody said that nothing lasts forever
Just the storm so I’ve been told
But it seems that when it rains, it pours
And you know (I try)

[Verse 1]
What becomes of a born loser?
I used to believe I was conceived to be king
Mommy was a drug user
Daddy died young, as a son I have seen
Many nights where he abused her
He was just a teen, and she was just a teen
When I was brought into their life hula
Hoop of deceit and lies
My poor bleeding eyes
Used to watch Nikki on the scooter
A daughter with no father may never realize
A man’s touch, a man’s trust, scrutinized
You either treat her like your queen or your bitch, right?
I had a lite-brite
It used to light up my life until the bills weren’t paid, and day became night
‘Zay became like my big brother
He would hand me down ‘nough hand-me-downs, get me through a few summers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Daddy didn’t preach good loving
Just about the time Momma had me in the oven
I was something in the making
Praising Momma raised a boy through the dramas of a Papa’s leaving
I’m a believer in Karma
So when Daddy died of AIDS, complicated days of a young and
Coming of age, I’m in a daze
Let me cut straight through the chase
I lived it, no twistin’ it
Christmas was gifts from the gov’ment
Watching my Momma plummet
Baby boo in her stomach, womb
By the stove in the winters
Heart cold in the summers, summers
Couldn’t fight the belly rumbles
Humble beginnings were mine
Family lying, uncle dying
Time and time again head to that Welfare line
A ladder to climb through hard times

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Momma got the lupus in her bones
Roof is caving in like the upper support’s gone
Move to the South, still Massachusetts home
So through the sunshine, the heart is a cold zone
Harder to pen storms through wind storms
When Com. Sense said Borrow a Dollar, economy was strong
Now we try to borrow tomorrow to get from
Yesterday’s somber with limited income
Outcome: We out of luck and some
Hence I’m living from buck-to-buck
Fuck what Clinton, Bush, and Obama do
Politicians got us in the hole I just can’t fit my Momma through
It’s possible to do impossible, but by pursuit of proper route
Obstacles, keep writing and cock and shoot
Screaming “who got the loot” like Notorious B.I.,
Chose another brother now I’m victorious, see why?

[Hook]

[Bridge][Reks]

Premo
Reks
Long time coming
Listen!

[Reks]

I think they want the new P.E now
Ice Cube, Nigga With An Attitude now
They want a dude who's immune to the rules
Short fuse, aiming at Q, Bishop on the roof now
They want me to say; Fuck who in the game
If your the best rapper alive, then Reks insane
I think Preme's insane, best producer alive
Me up on his track is like needles to the veins
Like burners to the brain, suicide chess, playing suicide king
My aim when I came was to bring back the Gangstarr audio reign
No longer R-E-K-S, it's R-E-Cocaine
Y'all on the way out, Reks on the way in
Eastcoast boom bap, PM to the AM
Opinion on my rap, delivery propane
Rhythmatic, eternal king, supreme, remember the name - REKS

Scrathes by DJ Premier

Rockabye, pop rapper to sleep, heavenly conscious
Melodies monstrous, R's one hell of an artist
Sylibal darksmith, lyrical bars pimp caution
Beware of close proximity cause conflicts
Even through all this garbage, nonesense, media sponsers
I'm gonna spit the raw shit, regardless
My thoughts in cockpit, steering past and just through the darkness
While nerds be writing blurbs in office
I am return of the legendary, duck through the cemetery
Soul of the ghost in my bones, so I never worry
UHH, I think they want the new Makaveli
I can really feel the pains and the strains through my belly
Hunger gettin' deadly, ain't a killer, don't tempt me
Fill the booth cuz the youth mental frames on empty
Opinion on my rap, the flow's ether, the soulseeker
Born leader, R-E-K-S remember the name

[Hook]

[Reks]

Yeah, I think I wanna kill Bill O'Riley
187 G-Dub, peel wheels on dunallis
Mommy I'm sorry, but when these dudes rap
I be thinkin that I should pull a Shyne in the party
Nickel nine in the audience of weak rap shows
I never needed guns, but as my stress grows
Need that East-swag back, a new Westcoast
80 percent of the new South rap shit blows
Now the Midwest, shinin', respect their grindin'
But turn up my face, the bullshit rap-whinin'
UHH, say goodnight to the industry, DJ Premier sentenced me
To prepare, something lethal for they ears
So here it is for the people, compare me to no other artist
I swear no equals, I hear their public opinion
On my rap, say the future of the game
Top 10 D.O.A. - Reks, remember the name

REKS[Hook: George Carlin & REKS]
They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don't want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interests. That's right. You know something? They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them over board 30 fucking years ago

Now I dumb it down to sleep
Close my eyes, pretend I am blind
But I know, yes I know, yes I know-o
There are no words to speak
I bite my tongue this time
And pretend not to teach
But I do, yes I do, yes I do-o

[Verse 1: REKS]
Good day to ya, might I say properly
Nothing like the good old American monopoly
Property, how do you control space?
Make 'em hate self, went out to control race
Democracy, please come out your hiding place
Hypocrisy, our leaders bare your ugly face
Mine eyes can see the coming of divided state
Philosophy, I know that I know nothing, Socrates

[Hook]

[Verse 2: REKS]
Uncle Sam and Uncle Tom were politicking
Sam was cracking the whip, Tom was cotton picking
Sam said to Tom, Tom wait a cotton picking
Man now you could be out the field, in the kitchen
Tom said, sir I reckon, so I got to listen
Gonna get me a bow tie, I'll get to fetchin'
Whatever you need fetched, and you can call me Benson
I'm at your service sir, if it don't involve lynching

[Outro: George Carlin]

They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them over board 30 fucking years ago. They don't want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers[Verse 1: Reks]

Lowest position to be is in the dirt man
I’m in that position like underneath the earth fam
See Jesse birthed Pam and Pam met David
And David just couldn’t stay, Pam couldn’t take it
Had to face it in them dirty dark slums
Where we barely saw crumbs, wishing thanksgiving come
But a lonely son stolen from God’s hands
Only homie get my plans with this dark skin, accepted outcast
Got pressured by ass before the adolescence
Malnourished, I guess it’s a blessing to understand hunger
Do other younger kids wonder where their school clothes
Handed them Skippies with holes and so my shoes froze
I was a bully, a punk, got A’s and I flunked
He got AIDS, I was shocked but didn’t comprehend
When momma said we was not infected by his sins
Yeah we was on the block but that was innocence

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Reks]

I used to beg for a place to stay, no bed
Nigga lay down on the floor and just close the eyes
No disguise, many knew I was in a bind
Sure they tried but this was my mountain to climb
Counting time thinking I’m destined to be great
See the great comes from nothing, what an obvious fate
A day late, one hundred pennies short
Smoking Newports on my way to court
Like Big he caught for an assault, I never did real time or a real crime
That’s a reason to be proud yet and still I’m feeling like
Iron Mike must have felt when he got that facial tattoo
Things I say so taboo mad at you? Nah displaced anger
Smoking, sipping Tanqueray, never met a stranger
Me an depression we are close like the star and manger
Jesus and the angels, I’m a picture painter
I ain’t shit but an egotistical bastard
See a pistol I’ll blast it, weak with peer pressure
Speak with fear bet ya, thought I had a heart of stone
Many years later rectangle box all alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reks]

Late calls, I ain’t coming home, studio time, crashing at spots
I can see you there just watching the clock (I ain’t shit)
If I could think about myself less
And focus on the pain I’m causing at home (yes)
But I’m too selfish
Worthless and helpless, chosen to be reckless
Poisoning myself with nicotine and Hennessy
To the flesh and memory, ask a simple question
I’m raising my voice instantly, the Devil is an enemy
A liar and a friend to me, keeping em close
Is to to Hell that you’re sending me? One last toast
To the born beggar who cried himself to sleep
When Billy said men don’t weep but I wept and I slept
And I woke then I smoked then I drink but I quit
And I quote, I’m a hypocrite
Pause that shit for a sec, I need a cigarette
I ain’t shit"Black cream"

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse One] [Reks]
Dear Oprah Winfrey
I know misogyny
Is rampant in our music and it pains you severely
But Dear Ms. Billion Dollar Income
Hear me
The path to success isn't merely:
Respect self, sincerely, remember Celie?
Slaved after mister
And when she disobeyed then he whipped her
Well we was picked up, broke down, whipped up
Said, "Thanks" to master when he tipped us
Upon tree, lift us
Noose as a necktie
Excuses, I guess I
Use cause I refuse to let my
Ego be abused by the stereotype
That blacks just might be better off as have nots
Than to have cops, harass us
Poor Jacqueline Onassis
Husband gunned down, supporting our black asses
We as poor folks frown upon a brother's success
The more he has, then we have less
And we have yet, been able to afford
Without buying the store
Instead of repair, get all the white Airs
Force 1/one to look in the mirror
And be ashamed as the truth appears
Nigga, negro, Afro, hero
To the youth who want to rhyme for deniro
And shine like them joints in the earlobes
The pain I've seen
Watchin' my people spend they black cream

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse Two] [Reks]
Everybody ain't Kanye West lord
I tell the kids, get a dream you can afford
But kids want stunts, smoke blunts and impress broads
Sip on syrup cause they idol got his cup
What this does
Is make it harder to give a fuck
The impulse
To ball got Cosby pissed off
That "buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto"
To invest in scratch tickets is a fucked up motto
Dress our autos, barely dress our kids
Some want Tims, but he gon' wait
Daddy need new rims
Damn
Did I write that right?
Question is
Are you gonna right that wrong?
Put my mic back on
Free speech is tell a nigga 'bout a nigga's self
You poor knowledge even if you got dumb wealth
Poor knowledge?
Dumb wealth?
All the money in the world, your black ass can't spell help

Chains and whips to chains and whips
Right into the latest kicks
And we
Floss our ice
Brush off haters
Black man's plight
Lusting paper
(We just gonna get paper)
We bought your American dream
The negro epidemic, black cream
(Black cream)
"Black cream"

[Big Shug singing]
Heeeey
Stay on your grind baby
Brush off the haters
Remain a player
Gettin' this paper
Black cream, yeeeeah
Black cream, yeeeeah
Gettin' this paper
Gettin' this paper
Black cream

[Outro] [Big Shug talking]
Big Shug. Reks. This is how we get down man
Cats is fightin' for money out there
We gotta keep it movin' man. One way or the other. I'm outWelcome to the 21st century
Park your spaceship, walk with me mentally
Over to the left we have death in the form
Of a baby in an incubator, fresh out the womb
Born to a fiendin´ mom
Pop died in Vietnam
He was one tantrum away from an aborted life
Afforded life, now the plight of a bastard child
Is past the Nile to fight civil wars
Several centuries bore the Civil Rights movement
Niggas like movin´ I think the tale
[?] grill that white chick
Nights seemed darker than black folk
Now Obama telling us have hope
His skin pale now in comparison
I look at how he treat Iraq, it´s embarassin´
Big Brother telling little brother give up your oil
And give up your cash
You don´t they mash your ass
Spoils: the American way
Did the Indians make
Makin´ deals when no deals to make
Jewels for your land
Jews in the camp Auschwitz
Crammed bodies into the fire
Was damned for the simple fact they wasn´t blue-eyed
Japanese did Enola Gay as she flew by
And as she dropped the bomb
The West was calm
The East was tortured by the gas and alarms
Saddam, he was hung, he was hanged
Just another nigger on a noose--
And he didn´t even order the planes
Welcome to the 21st century
Anthem on the symphony
Walk with my mental design
Kamikaze, Uncle Ozzie said boy you need Jesus
Best believe he´s and them fire breathin´ demons
Leave em in the slums, look at him
Hummin´ pin, strummin´ the tune of the ghetto echoin´
Drummin´ the [?] Geppetto puppets
These pawns are pop songs
I love it, how I rose above it
Then up on the pulpit
Spit sermons that Eric would adore
Epic exploration, raw metaphors
You ain´t never met a force
Pen in the paws, this enormous
Flawless flow´s a fortress, foes can forfeit
Before spit, I was on some aww shit
Listened in awe, then became R with God´s gift
From the darkest of tunnels I bore life
I walked when I saw night
Rode into the sun like sunlight
Shining in the midst of hell
Rhyming so I missed the cell
Too busy scribbling lyricism I dwell
Within the--
Realm of the 21st century
Revolution Road, got a revolution flow
Mentally I blow, leave the holes in your speakers
Jesus in the soul, Reks in your earpieces
Gotta get the dough
Benjamin stacks in the pants´ creases
He´s just cut from a mold
An old head po´ head sick with diseases
Tongue spits seizures, cause foes amnesias
Show to the O-F-F to my death is my peoples
See through hoes and follow codes
Rose from the bottom of the slums to the heights of the steeples
Any opposed now below
You not know a boy who raps similar, nann nigga equal
Game over, you mournin´ like so?
You John to the Does
From the cranium down to the toes tagged
Under zippered bags
Where you get your lyrics at
Fags.com? We get rid of that
If you want to leave your wig attached
Better not spit or rap
Cause I chip in half paragraphs with the battle axe
Ebonical tongue chronical times
I young, fly, flashy
I´m grimy, nappy, I´m R-E ashy
From the dirt, never been classy
Severin´ your fucking veterans with my raps, see
Not here to chit chat, rather spit raps
Get my chips stacked
Greater than a nigga named Gatsby[Intro]
"Oh, it's you again! Don't you ever give up?"
"At one time I thought of giving up, but now I think differently"
"You can help change things, by learning more about your culture"
"and believing in yourself."

"It's no joke. Tell me!"

Glorious salutations and hellos
In other words peace to my [?] fellows
Been a lot of ups and downs in the ghettos
Smiles and frowns maneuver through the pounds
Not the loud or the pistols, talking about crowds up inc Bristol
Skyping with my kids did he miss you
Wish I could be there to hug and kiss you
Distance the issue, relentless the grizzle
AKA grind shake and bake time
Cooked a classic, wake 'em up time-starved bust capper
Chino Vinnie style
Pen be mad superior to inferior literature child
Of the Christian Parker school of art
The shout to the missing martyrs fought for all us
Beautiful parlors with the [?] joggin' from the noggin
Father MC, the father him see
To God be the glory, spoils to the victor
Off the chain the scale the Richtor
Mr. glass, meet the pain inflictor
Cross out your name, add me to the list of
Quiet storm that formed in the lips like whispers
Grow to a venomous growl
My signature wild wild
It's a glamorous markish style
You punk bitch often, I'm in a loft with the pen
Upper class senior whip ass with the phlegm
Ahem ahem, lozenges for the carpenters
Master craftsmen, swift pat as if this is aspen motion
Picture closed caption
In the zone adaptin'
To the habitat, battlefield battlecat
Tongue like a thunderclap
On my J-O-B, number jack like 1-0-1 I might
You bow wow, nigga bow down
Rhythmatic Eternal King supreme
Need jewels for the crown, you fool simmer down
As I sizzle saute, Hazardis Soundz all day
Flawless flow my forte, all my vocay

Talking Cube not the cousin Dede
Verbal AK machine gun tongue make 'em lean like the fiend go dumb
Bag a skunk, cream in your shorty bunk
You will all succumb

Make you think of funeral service
Rest in peace to you bitch ass MCs
Eyes Watching God got you niggas nervous
Word up

(54 points for Jordan)[Lil' Fame]
Let's take it back to that real hip hop shit
Bring back. . . the spirit of Pac, Biggie, Pun, Big L
All in one
I introduce y’all to my nigga:
Reks! Come on!

[Reks]
This is historic rhetoric from the one R-E-K-S
Reborn through legends, giving a new breath to lungs
Spirit of Pun, L, Big, Makaveli the Don
(Lil' Fame: The flow timeless, salute to 5 hands!)
To hip hop honors greats too late
So on this tape I recreate what heaven took from us
Passion of Pac, the swag of anything Biggie drop
Big L’s non-stop shit on you talk
And Big Pun with the deli delivery that’ll lyrically
Top Super Lyrical, Ebonics I’m giving you
Kick in the Door, this Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z
Who listen to the greatest to write on 5 mics
(Lil' Fame: This is a representation of warriors monumental, follow me
Set it off for Pac!)

The revolution is on in this song, so holla Westside (Feel me!)
Pac’s like definition of a thug nigga that’s right
And to my enemies, get down on your knees
‘Cause if it’s beef we gon’ ride, Hail Mary!
If there’s a heaven for a G, picture me sippin’ Hennessy with B.I.G, Pun, L and Pac (ha-ha)
Up on the clouds on the block looking down Mama smile I know you proud of me now
I’m a O.G.! And to my homies don’t cry ‘cos we do or die pour a little O.E (Yeah nigga!)
Fuck the police! (fuck all y’all), on these streets
It’s Me Against the World, M.O.P

(Blow it up for Biggie Smalls)
The glorious Notorious, (Brooklyn nigga!)
Dead on trigger, (lift ya)
May you rest in pieces, your entourage tour with Jesus, Gucci fly
Mafioso Don with the Bad Boy logo, palm grippin' the Dom Pérignon (what)
Moschino buying, private jet flying
I’m like the black Frank White, ‘cause my game’s tight (right)
Brands and spokesmen strolling and get a bitch open
Hopin' I’ma hit her with the Trojan
Keep a box by the Glock on the dresser
Lifestyles to apply pressure, baby baby

(BX! Salute to Big Pun, come on. . .)
Punisher's ready, I got the machete in a Chevy
With the pistol as heavy as Heavy D, lyrics heavenly
Metaphors and melodies show you how to be a player like Bill Bellamy (ah shit)
My niggas known for felonies
Boogie Down New York the ground that I walk
Find you in the dark surround you with hawks
Act like you in charge (yo yo yo)
Terror is the squad, I’m a lethal mathematician
Adding up the cash, you're fishing
Rappers missing, poetry that so proficient
Known as the dopest written, vocal spitting
Rolling with the Puerto Rican coalition
All the focus missing, ¡pana!
You can't match my grammar, Scarface face like Montana
Test Pun and miss the manana

(We ‘bout to take it uptown, Harlem world, Big L, salute!)
Big L was D.I.T.C.'s truest
Been between more sheets than Klu Klux
Your rapper Big L would give two fucks
Ya ho love me too much
Never seen her grill without my two nuts
American gangster, Frank Lucas
You got the "how could he?" bling
I rock the "what's poppin' now?" ring
Money longer than Yao Ming
The Harlem City cat, with the hard gritty raps
You be all yappity-yap, my dogs really clap
I’ve got the fly gear and I like to fly Lears
All across states got your bitch payin’ my fares
Chill with the idea anybody compares
Nobody comes near, Big L, oh yeah

[Lil' Fame]

What up, what up
Statik Selektah, show off, show off
Their nigga Reks, their nigga Reks, their nigga Reks
Show off, show off yeah
Blaze P, Blaze P, Blaze P
Show off, show off
Ya nigga Fame, Ya nigga Fame, nigga Fame
Show off, show off
To the homies ride with me, look for my shit soon yeah[Scratch Hook]:
"Limos, arenas and TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes"

[Verse One]
I scribe my life on border lines before the rhymes
I thought of dime chasin', mind racin'
Off the fine wine agent inauguration
Of a poet
Laureate, my story yet
To meet the apex they say Reks the whole east best
They say that s-t-a-t-i-k
The greatest of the DJs
Producer brother truest in the beautifulest decay
And we say, we took it from the ghettos to arenas
Found our heaven in between us
Seamless scene of dreamers
The team in position, powerful autograph and taking pics
Groupies front row turn to Marriott making flicks
Amazing this in making a matrix is bound to wake to this
The patience is a virtue, burst through the waiting list
Graveshifting it just to make difference
Just to make the distance in us and them significant
From Paris in my cinnamon's lavish living the benefits
Sincerely all keep it one and all on the trips with us

[Scratch Hook]:

Autograph pictures and classy hoes" - Beastie Boys 'No Sleep Till Brooklyn'

[Verse Two]:
I'm doing rhymes now, bye bye to crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Doing arenas in Athena and I know you seen us
At every festival, fans put us on pedestals
Packing metal's forgettable when you've mastered a better flow
Of income, and then some, now here come the effin' hoes
I went from ashy to classy
Shorty asked me to sign her double D's overseas
To add these foreigners that we're performing for to our conglomerate
We prominent we jammin' it, profits from the rhyming shit
Shorty it's an honor to be on the dick of someone so notorious
We worshiped as a don of spit
Pondered if I chose another route, bowed out
Took the safer role punch a clock instead of blazing shows
Doubt for the the nonbelievers all I believe is from the ghetto
To the arena, sky's the limit for the big dreamers
Word up

[Scratch Hook]:
"Limos, arenas and TV shows

[Verse Three]:
And we our hometown royalty
All you see is the red carpet for the progress
God bless to y'all who stuck with us through the process
Of course it's not all flawless
Evil forces want to see us falter
Separate as we divorce ya
And I don't fault ya
Father forgive him for not feeling the roster
The rawest since Rawkus before it lost its luster
I feel like Busta Leading The New, feeding them food
Even through the meaningless Stat and Reks is meaningful
Breezing through cities the allure and it's all a blur
All occur cause we keep it true, say they seeing you
What's been missing as we sitting on a dynasty
Rap minus me at negative one, honestly
Rap minus Stat, just wack each track crack
East coast can kick you're feet up, cause we back
Straight, No Chaser make those papers for those acres
Build your bucks to break up, let's cake up
Wake up

[Scratch Hook]:
"Limos, arenas and TV shows

I wanna travel the world
Lace my wife with the diamonds and pearls
My mom with a crib
So she can live in peace she deserves
Give my son Zeke everything I missed as a youth
So every time I get in the booth
I rap with a focus
Rats and the roaches
No more of that
More like plaques and awards
It’s the new prognosis
Ride or die ? always said you the dopest
And I know this so I’m aiming at the game like coaches
Pain had us hopeless
No more living broke like as hobos
We building like Legos the logos
Show-o-double ff (showoff)
Reppin’ M-A-double S (Mass) like a Malolm X out of jail photo
By any means necessary
Green’s the itinerary
Lawtown scene and the dream’s to be rich, you ready?
Well live it up, fill the cup, make a toast
All my niggas know that victory’s close
Held your head if ya…

[Hook]
Big dreamers, we all seem to be big dreamers
Wanted it all, oh we wanted it all
Cause, we big dreamers
When me and my homies were small we kept our eyes on the mall
Big dreamin’ til my rims spin
And my swag right
Cause my gear fresh
And mom’s got a crib of her own
Shit I’m grown, so I’m gonna keep big dreamin’ I got gots to get it

[Termanology Verse 2]
It’s all-scientific
Mystic, you know the earth and the stars
Don’t hesitate to say heard of the law
We the boys from the north
When Krumb put me on, I was under 21 with a gun in my palm
But that was way back
Wishin I had a starter jacket
In the part of Bradford Street where the crack heads were on the corner clappin’
Before the I-Tunes, I was high-noon
With my Ice-Cube tape bangin’ at the loudest vol-ume
Had to defend mine, without seeing Fed-time
Member when I told my momma, I ‘ma make it big time
That’s when I made up my mind, I was big dreamer
Aim for the sky, label guys gonna feed us
Caviar and such, now we on the bus
Perion and cuffs?
Cali in the dutch
We on a world tour
I’m so proud of myself, I seen the big picture
IMAX theatre, ology, I was a big dreamer

[Hook]

[Krumbsnatcha-Verse 3]
The million dollar man, call him K-Dibiase
OT the ice man, a rap’s Liberace
Frost bit, three hundred thou for some car shit
Still underground, get the hoodies for the mosh pit
That’s just a dream now, but it’s like a part of me
Escape mental poverty, now its like monopoly
On my mind constantly
Out for the property
? Money and vision is missing properly
And I’m a work til the good lord bury me
Give back to charity, manifest prosperity
And nothing change when there’s money to burn
Just be stunnas with the young gunnas Reks and Term
It started from a dream on the corner just rapping
But now we hard to find like Osama Bin Laden
Dreams now materialized, ain’t no surprise
From the bottom to the top, seen the family rise

[Hook]"Black cream"

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse One] [Reks]
Dear Oprah Winfrey
I know misogyny
Is rampant in our music and it pains you severely
But Dear Ms. Billion Dollar Income
Hear me
The path to success isn't merely:
Respect self, sincerely, remember Celie?
Slaved after mister
And when she disobeyed then he whipped her
Well we was picked up, broke down, whipped up
Said, "Thanks" to master when he tipped us
Upon tree, lift us
Noose as a necktie
Excuses, I guess I
Use cause I refuse to let my
Ego be abused by the stereotype
That blacks just might be better off as have nots
Than to have cops, harass us
Poor Jacqueline Onassis
Husband gunned down, supporting our black asses
We as poor folks frown upon a brother's success
The more he has, then we have less
And we have yet, been able to afford
Without buying the store
Instead of repair, get all the white Airs
Force 1/one to look in the mirror
And be ashamed as the truth appears
Nigga, negro, Afro, hero
To the youth who want to rhyme for deniro
And shine like them joints in the earlobes
The pain I've seen
Watchin' my people spend they black cream

[Hook] [Big Shug] (Reks)
From chains to whips
To chains and whips
Hopped off the slave ships into the fly kicks
Floss our ice, gettin' paper
All my niggas want paper
We just gotta get paper
(We bought your American Dream
The negro epidemic, black cream)
Black cream

[Verse Two] [Reks]
Everybody ain't Kanye West lord
I tell the kids, get a dream you can afford
But kids want stunts, smoke blunts and impress broads
Sip on syrup cause they idol got his cup
What this does
Is make it harder to give a fuck
The impulse
To ball got Cosby pissed off
That "buck that bought the bottle
Coulda struck the lotto"
To invest in scratch tickets is a fucked up motto
Dress our autos, barely dress our kids
Some want Tims, but he gon' wait
Daddy need new rims
Damn
Did I write that right?
Question is
Are you gonna right that wrong?
Put my mic back on
Free speech is tell a nigga 'bout a nigga's self
You poor knowledge even if you got dumb wealth
Poor knowledge?
Dumb wealth?
All the money in the world, your black ass can't spell help

Chains and whips to chains and whips
Right into the latest kicks
And we
Floss our ice
Brush off haters
Black man's plight
Lusting paper
(We just gonna get paper)
We bought your American dream
The negro epidemic, black cream
(Black cream)
"Black cream"

[Big Shug singing]
Heeeey
Stay on your grind baby
Brush off the haters
Remain a player
Gettin' this paper
Black cream, yeeeeah
Black cream, yeeeeah
Gettin' this paper
Gettin' this paper
Black cream

[Outro] [Big Shug talking]
Big Shug. Reks. This is how we get down man
Cats is fightin' for money out there
We gotta keep it movin' man. One way or the other. I'm out[Verse 1: Reks]
I came to build with you, paint a real picture
I dont gas you up, I keep it real with you
I dont walk around town with the six figures
Whisper in your ear what I'd buy you to get with you
I ain't never been the life of the party
Yet you always plant the seeds so you could call me
And I probably dont deserve you
Worthy of a world view
Travel cross oceans but he's still gon' hurt you
Im'a be your shoulder soldier ride or die
I'm the kind of guy counting my blessings cause I'm destined to catch ya eye
You gonna love me when you wake up and he ain't by your side
Say bye bye to the falsified realities
So many beautiful women become casualties
Let me be your healer, glady
You could have me to use and abuse
Push me grab me all you gotta do is ask me, and I'll be there

[Hook: C Sharp]
I don't wanna wait too long
For you to return back home
Feelings is much too strong
If you don't love me
Please let me know
So I can walk out that door
No break up to make ups no more
If you dont love me

[Verse 2: Reks]
My best regards to the love lost sentiments to women whove been cut off
Walked on, treated like a hit it quit it rap song
This ain't one of them rap songs
This a love poem to romance gone...wrong
When trust is long gone ill be ya ear
Listen here record careful you forever and more
He left you beefin with the landlord
And ya little man need a man for the answers
He just wanna fuck you
Give em lip he flex his muscles
Neighbors said they heard a tussle
Come here ma cause he ain't 'pose to touch you
He's supposed to love you treat you right
I can't knock his hustle
Wrote this song for the wrong thats been done to ladies in the humvee
Cause you livin comfee
Till he bored with you and throw you upon streets
Song speaks to the ones who seek one true love

[Hook: C Sharp]

[Verse 3: Reks]
Never wore the finer clothes drove expensive cars
I was into study halls tryna study broads
Women from venus, men are from mars
So I thought that we would meet up in the stars
Cheek she gave him, muah
I was gettin geeked thinkin she was gon show the bra
Till she told me we should pause
Get to know each other before we really get involved
But I was tryna get up in them draws
Introduced to blue balls dog
The truth was love her puppies was lovely
But now im tryna chat before you touch me
Rap you wanna fuck me no more with the break ups make ups
No time to waste love you dont love me
Please let me know so I can pack bags hit the road
Walk out that door fasho
Kid games for the kiddies im a grown man
Only plan to kick game if you with me

[Hook: C Sharp][Verse 1: Ea$y Money]
I’m a motherfucking derelict, nigga, títere malo
He fuck with Easy, he get a hollow
Show no remorse, please tell him I don’t
Give a fuck about you, eat dick and swallow
Better put them on ST. we are
A bunch of mon-S-T-E-Rs
Run up on you all, let three squeeze off
Draw blood like a phlebotomist when I clap mine
Your life, that’s synonymous with your rap lies
You called a snitch on anonymous rap lines
Y’all know just what time it is when I rap I’m
Goin’ down as one of the best that did it
Wanna go rhyme for rhyme, I brought some rounds
This ain’t no merry-go, I don’t horse around
Easy will slaughter clowns, funny how the rap game
In a drought when it’s so watered down

[Verse 2: Termanology]
I’m a derelict peace to my cousin Derek in the bing
He go and said it heroin sellin’ adrenaline
I’m Einstein with the rhyme, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my fine mami will ride, show me a sign
Getting money and I’m on it, distorting these rappers, flaunting this
It’s more than a vick I’m plotting I’m robbing the whole economy
I step into the booth I turn it into a sauna
I’m chilling in the Bahamas you chilling in your pajamas, b
Hickory dock hot nickels will pop
I’m on tour with [front?] doc and go on selling the rock
I’m the same old Term, [quarter water?] trying to roll up
Better hold up if you want to talk shit ‘bout we
I’m history and I get more gs than the average rapper
Will ever get or see. Unfortunately for you, I’m going to stick around
Keep my weed bright green, but I keep my liquor brown

[Verse 3: Reks]
Yo I’m a derelict, definite rhyme specialist
Rap’s still in a deficit unless you mention my syndicates
Speaking through raw epilogue Easy, Term, see to earn
Leapfrog, it’s your turn, jump on in
Buzz on them, [?] in, bust your gun
I clench my pen, kill the masses with the paragraphs
Us go in. Y’all just burst my thoughts cursed
Bar first, guzzle, bartender hustle hustle
Trying to keep it authenticious slaying the towns style
Brain in the clouds now my wildstyle
Fab Five Freddyish, ready set get your green on
Your clock HNIC, someone to lean on
Fuck the thuggery you mean mothery
See the team’s strong the Bean gone star gazing be long
On your radio slates for eons but these pawns
To the system’s hating, kill them all for violating

[Verse 4: Artisin]
I am like a derelict, they should put my squad in a group home
Get your dude low in the [?] I’m dealing out
Death for free, you can get a homicide coupon
Make your heart collapse, let me break you a few bones
Compound fracture, poke through the skin
Let my nigga poke your girl while I’m poking her friend
I’m a motherfucking sin, I ain’t sacrilegious
My life consists of rap, drug deals, and clapping biscuits
Shot down like a shorty when you ask for digits
I’ll tell you know that you’re wack, I am that realistic
So you could save the time and save the trees
Cause most of this paper is wasted on these fake MCs
They hate indeed, instead of spending every day hating me
They should go home and make a beat
Or write a hot verse, but I guess they’d rather get shot first
So maybe they just really forgot how being hot works[Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Intro]
Lord, I got something that your money can’t buy

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
I know dudes that catch your body like a stage dive
Cross over, move the work like they A.I
Wolf on wall street, get high on bass side
Still drinking tiger bone like consistently
I’m still smelling like weed shopping at Tiffany’s
I don’t commit no problems, I just had an epiphany
I used to fuck a Spanish bitch and her friend bad
And when she went to work I got some friend head
I never asked about her man cause he been dead
You see I still communicate through a star text
Star Trek, flip phone, I eject
The process, focus on the project
Yeah, stay in the tumble when they broke
But now they getting rap money acting like it’s dope
I remember when you sold soap acting like it’s gold
You niggas’ll sell your souls just to sell records
Niggas robbed you then sold back your necklace
Throw you off the roof, niggas living reckless
It’s cause

[Verse 2: Termanology]
My lungs might go black, I stand from the Pakistan
Afghani kush, Amsterdam, packing jam
Throw a drink in my palm like it’s my catcher’s hand
I take a hundred shots then I throw up in the street
Drink Champs, drink Lager on the beach
Fortunate alcoholic, Gucci wallet is brolic
Gin and Tonic, Vodka, cranberry, getting bodied
Marijuana, purp, 30 Xannies and them Oxy’s
Mix a Klonopin pill with a shot of Brigade
I drive drunk home, Jesus take the wheel from me
Save my soul, the one that Satan trying to steal from me
I get drunk ‘til everything sound real funny
My still stomach only thing to kill or steal from me
I be wilding in the club like I’m still 20
Wilding out, getting locked, who got some bail for me?

[Verse 3: REKS]
Shit fuck it, show up
Always I sip some shit, lyrics that lick his ears
Anonymous, we’re syndicate, drink Champs in this bitch
Give me a fifth of Rémy Martin, nigga
Nuh-uh, you don’t want no fucking problem, nigga
‘Bout time me and compadres went all day
With models to this motel, now we’re seeing the world sideways
Pissing alleys and hallways, you be spitting that blaze
We be spitting the John Blaze, please give me besos mami
Can see the preacher Sundays, saturday was a blur
A bunch of bottles and bitches holla if this is your
Prefered type of weekend on the world tour thinking
With Q-Tip, Phife D, Young G, Alisha E and
Skeet, skeeting like it’s 1993 again
Might just hit the tree again, will we ever see you in
Show off CNN? Focus like the poachers
I’m tipsy off the potion, mixing absent devotion
To the Henny minus Coke’ll leave you slained like homie from La Nostra
Straight, no chaser with the soda, word up[Verse 1: Reks]
Reks and Term, get your urn, get your hearses ready
Voorhees vs. Freddy boy we murder every beat
Giving heat, driven medleys
I’ve already severed heart beats and arteries
R to E King supreme philosophy
Follow me follow me pussy pardon me possibly
We knew AZ, Nas, Jay-Z, big bars
You spit charms then we split the walls and seas that part
Moses of flowers, focus them darts to heart stop
Till sasquatch feet, I repeat this is art
You are not psychosyllable, my lyrical’s top notch
Leap frog over y’all, hopscotch
We brought Sha Money for harmony, I’mma need y’all to promise me
Lots of accolades and praise for two rappers bringing it back
To back in the days minus the chains
The East need that king back so we came to be that boss
Reks and Term, it’s the Face Off

[Hook: Reks (Termanology)]
A deadly duo is a duo that can do it deadly
Psychosyllable, I’ll go lyrical apeshit
Face to face let’s face off (face off)

Psychosyllable, I’ll go lyrical apeshit
Face to face let’s face off (face off)

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Termanology, the definition of horrific sadistic animalistic
Explicit vicious lyricism, call me cannibalistic
I will eat any rapper that got beef, you looking like red meat
And I got dinosaur teeth, I repeat I’m a monster
Running through the allies of your conscious
Catch you at your calm son then stretch you like a Charleston
And chew the way I do chew rappers and then I spit em out
This ain’t nothing I kid about, leave jizzum on your bitch’s blouse
I’m on a mission now, bullets, pistols, missiles, bloaw
Pull up with my chick, she’s wild, she’ll stick you, kiss you, kill you, wow
I’m in my shrink’s office plotting on a Brinks truck
It’s full of long money, Sha Money made this beat awesome
You want a face off, me and Reks already ready
My machete is deadly, it cut through your Pelle Pelle
So let’s battle, but you bring it, better go hard
When you hear that show off show off know your dough’s gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reks & Termanology]

[Termanology]
Trust me they do not want it, I’m fantastic
Hop out a mini-van blasted
I’m trash, I’ll cum in a fan’s eyelashes
It’s murder masters, duo double murder assassins
Killing everybody, making money off of your actions

[Reks]
Hurt on enemy cats can send my sympathy passed as ministers
Sinister sentences I send em to ?
Pardon the bitches I’m vicious, lyricism jurrasic
Pencil and pad shit past these modern rap bastards
Politicking with Term, how we gonna earn?
These rappers getting shredded, beheaded, pick a new cranium severed

[Termanology]
Call a medic, I said it I mean I meant it
Depending on how much lettuce I get I will leave you shredded
So forget it, call the ambulance
Leave you looking anonymous like mannequins
Me and my Hispanic clique be on some satanic shit

[Reks]
Shit me and my conglomerate Dominic pencil prominent
Poetry, ponder ? to spit all you can do is honour it

[Hook]Esoteric, representin' in my home territory
Boston, rock the house

[Reks]
Enter my tea party, mind ya manners
My fingertips flip more alphabets than Vanna
Raisin' the banner, count em' sixteen, it seems y'all MCs forget
We got to have it but we can't have it yet
After the Reks number seventeen
Follow, I swallow and spit bobbles
Like the hollow tips, shatter ya dreams a mass lotto
Northern border slaughter runnin' up
B-O-S-T-O in the state to blow the whole planet when we flow
Skydivin' off the Prudential like I'm demented
Cause I chill with all these drunk MCs who schizophrenic
Reks and Eso mix like Terry Glenn and Bledsoe
Pass complete, E how the rest go

[Esoteric]
Yo, we breakin' necks of these space cadets
Makin' threats, J and Reks make checks and star-laced cassettes
My rap style whoops MCs like a crack vile
You suck vibe, like whitey duck five
Up inside march the mass, rap and talkin' trash
Cats in body caskets
Don't have to ask when it come to rippin'
Just chill, I fit the bill
Fit the skill from that abandoned hill
I know you sucker ducks wanna join in my fleet
When ya see me in the Lex swingin' up the street
Straight destroyin' the Bean, you could learn from this
Esoteric and Reks, two microphone mass murderers

It's ya man Mr. J-live
And it's ya man Sahdeeq I be a household name

[J-Live]
In New York we conquer like Ghengis, with no need to con
Straight up and down like ya head when the beat's on
Infiltration camp just like Marine recon
And kick ass with cleets on, dangerous to sleep on
Like cats with matress but you put the sheets on
Equipped with the lost by stewards from dusk till dawn
In other words, you made ya bet so lie in it
Career-wise the sleek shall now be infinite
I punk and pro-name from proper to pronoun
Cause we chase clowns from Medina to Beantown
Whatever's left, let my man Reks shut it down
Cause they banned from both spots, yo Shabaam how that sound

[Shabaam Sahdeeq]
It sounds monstrous, most MCs poposterous
Wearin' hoes in they straw like rhinocerous
In BK, we quick to light shit like phospherous
Leave ya burnin' like a witch huh, screamin' like a bitch huh
Ride till you die like a kid in a hearse
Slummin' a verse, leavin' layin' under a nurse
Worst flow I heard since rappin' dukes flute
If we was on a plane I'd push you out the cargo chute
With a parachute, full of dishes, best of wishes bitches
Bater up this rap game's all hits and misses
Keep it cookin' like kitchens
And lace y'all fools with the fixins
Start up ya engine, I'll race y'all niggas till the endin'
That's all that matters

Pacewon
It's Young Z I gets high off ends
Represent it in my home territory
Straight out of Jersey, you heard me

[Pacewon]
Yo, nigga been jayed, Redman and El De Sensai
Ballers hit the club every Wednesday
Flossin' love us, tall boy dizzy off of us
Chillin' on Chancellor right by Ruckers
Check it, CEO see me blow
Man with more friends than the TV show
Like milk, got a creamy flow
Easy yo, roll like C3-PO
Kidnap the president, don't leave evidence
Body get injured don't use medicine
Even if I'm guilty, step off innocent
Born in Brooklyn, now a North citizen

[Young Z]
Look, a motherfuckin' stoned crook
Erase ya whole family name right out the phone book
Accident, is you kiddin' me
We enemies, I blast them niggas delibrently
In North, it's lil' niggas on the creep
I'll take Jigga's rims and sell that shit to Bleek
Run yo mouth they catch you in the street
With the 4-5 out just smacked you to sleep
Yeah, he ain't know def is real
Yeah, half a Sweet up in Bed it's real
Yeah, all y'all talkin' slick
It's Bricks motherfucker get off my dick

Danja Mowf...Lonnie B
Represent

[Danja Mowf]
Hey yo, my words get around like he say, she say
When I rhyme and connect the lines like freeway
Tried to be the most def like I'm from BK
But I'm Danja Mowf, Down South from the VA
Since I came I been in the game like EA
When I had gazelle and the snake skin BK's
Now I run around niggas like I was a freeway
Get up in they ass so fast I should be gay
Don't give a fuck and keep talkin' like BJ
Talk shit but I back it up like a DJ
VA nigga what, make it look easy
As I pass the mic to Lonnie B. watch what he say

[Lonnie B.]
I got something for all y'all who like to battle niggas for fame
VA gon' tear y'all other spots out of the frame
My name alone will have you gaspin'
I be dashin' through ya lines like a running back in action
Head crackin' wack rappers like Bo Jackson
Ya out for lifetime, never deal with ya right rhymes
Face who, I'll make ya hold ya breath till ya face blue
Ya whole crew gon' look like Smurfs when I'm through
I'll go on and on like Erykah
Maybe next lifetime I'll be scared of ya
But right now I'm ahead of ya
Out the hucket bucket, ya funeral when they bury ya
And scream VA up in this bitch, who wanna carry ya[Verse 1]
Ahem, clear phlegm, commence to air dem
Gems dem jewellery, keep all buffoonery
Away from him, ten porch monkeys dancing for the big boss
I ain't gon' say their names I'mma let y'all
Be the blind niggas leading blind niggas into them
Flame James Brown, black prayer, fuck James
Better duck, see my man before he ready to kill again
Palin and McCain, Herman Cain murder on the brain
How come the cops who shot Diallo were were arraigned?
Strange Music with a Tech N9ne, turn the crime scene
I seen violence lean, probably green, probably rule the all
Devilish balls from heaven, (?) Hell is hard
Did they mistake us for Waco, Texas?
David Koresh in flesh, this a culture not a cult
'80s to the '90s where they find me on revolt
Now a nigga think he god because no fork on pork
Motherfuckers better to die, what's live for?
I don't live for USA, hear me I die for the theory
Where liberty is liberty, so if I sense an enemy
I click clack back, turn his soul into a memory

[Hook] x2
I pledge, no allegiance to no flags
These streets coloured with rags
Felt blues or the bloodshed
My country, 'tis of thee

[Verse 2]
Little schoolboy, hand on his heart
Pledge allegiance for the bloodshed and wars we fought
Caught a glimpse of the victims, the afterthoughts
Post traumatic, the syndrome, sleeping in parks
Little ghetto boy, hand on his Glock
Cocked back for his rag just playing his part
Taught, aim for the head, not the leg, you got
To blow the top off, pop off, better be sure
You leave no trace for them to know your face
For them to go so ape, then spraying up your place
Revenge got a raw taste, aw wait, baby in the crib hit
Baby in the rib, now baby can't live, baby dead, baby get wet up
Results with niggas fed up, tears at wakes
I pray you keep your head up
Dead up, or dear god, you dying your all for colour schemes
All a dream to get the CREAM, boss
Laws, fuck the cost to floss
The glitter, the gloss
The bigger the voice, the bigger the choice (Salute!)
Concerned for em, learnin' em
Revolutionary's necessary, and your flag's we burnin' 'em

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Reks]
Hard body, my bars probably
Are off John Gotti, Bob Marley
Step poppy banging I was hardly
Higher than them handle bars
Big was higher than the stars
Be now handle bars, awesome gnarly
Awe son to Marcus Garvey
Tongue flew back to Africa
Sing Sing, Attica, pardon me
This the kind of beat that bring the this is that part of me
Pray for me attitude magnitude possibly
Katrina flow, water, don't try avoid us
Kidnap DJs, ducttape for dollars
Propaganda revolution gun cock your hammer
Lyrical gift with big ass bad santa
The grammar slammin' in your sleep spit
Bitches on this weed and thong song shit, Freaknik
Mardi Gras party hard
I'm laughing at ya'll, hardy har
Bar for bar body all of ya'll, freaknik

[Hook: Reks]
I'ma need participation here
Hands in the air can I get an aw yeah (aw yeah)
Sucka DJs let's get one thing clear
Hazardis and Reks yeah this our year (aw yeah)
B-boys and DJs DJs
MCs graffiti artists
Whenever we play we play
The revolution now in your ear

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Haile Selassie lungs, Bob Marley bong
Marcus Garvey hardy get my black party on
Malcolm X tech, by any means
Still rep Queens, by any means
Martin Luther thoughts, smokin' Newports
Old English 40, fucking an English shorty
Elijah Muhammed heart, with his crown too
Farrakhan tongue, you hear my sounds through
Harriet Tubman feet, mind of Mandela
Shots rain nigga you gon' need an umbrella
Obama focus, Cashis Clay hands
Seen black eyes like Ray-bans
Che Guevara beard, vision of Chavez
And still run laps around A-rab heads
So let's connect throught that e-mail address
And keep the shit moving forward Haz never backwards

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Saigon]
While our society buyers rival a variety of liars
They putting something in the water probably a virus
Wise iris bright as the eye of Osiris
But I'm overlooked cause I'm dropping science
Instead of eyein' for flyness
How we survive all the bloggers who try to rob us
And never give us our propers
Cause motherfuckers is knob slobbers
They like balls in they mouth
And I ain't talkin' bout Gobstoppers
Click boom, no shakalaka
And how can ya'll listen to yada yada
When I could concoct a provcative verse and merk it like a choppa
It's not the shit to be black no more
I think we need to be seein' some afros more
A rebel without a pause
No pause for the cause
It come to that revolution it's balls to the wall
Saigon legendary, salute
Let me get the fuck out of here before the hook come

[Hook][Intro]
(women speaking) Troy Davis broke my heart. So that really lit my fire, when they executed an innocent man but let a baby killer go free. So I have a problem with things like that

[Verse 1: REKS]
Illegal to be high, but legal to die from cancer
Chance to commit suicide, why thank ya
Troy Davis dead, Casey Anthony free
She can have another baby, don't fuck with police
Scratch that last line, yeah, fuck the police
Everybody prep to plead the fifth when they stroll streets
We are all targets for dogs as precious as harshest
Reality's protection's preposterous, but God is
Separate from State, but the godless
Clearly state in who we trust, cause forefathers
Are the many saw one, not unity dumb dumb
But in the meek for weak to succumb
Too many were home, or fed syphilis
Guinea pigs thinkin' it was government benefits
The ignorance, the bliss of the double A's in the back, gotta love it

[Hook]
Reality is
Lies, deceit, pain, complicated pressure
Reality is
Envy, greed, mysterious, wants over needs
You see, life is make believe
Pinch me, I must be dreaming
Gotta find who Gepeto these strings
Pinocchio spreadin' them wings
Reality is

[Verse 2: REKS]
If showing your own body parts is optional
But that there caused body parts you must protect
Somethin' about this life here is not logical
Through the windshield, should've protect your neck
New wish it, but paralyzed can drive
Idiocy of it all, we can't disguise
Give the kids condom to practice safe sex
Priests making sure alter boys stay blessed
Say REKS is about shock value
Say whatever's on mind to find what button to push
Nothing 'bout what I say should have you
As upset as a criminal say, or George Bush
Our boat was not even bought cause it causes
Financial hardships, we are all heartless
Cause pain and pass off to other sources
Water cooler talk in office

[Hook]

[Verse 3: REKS]
Reality is, a tragedy just
Like a Shakespeare'in plot, Aleppo twist
Dark fantasy, yeah they exist
But Mrs. Teacher on a mission tongue kissin' teenagers and shit
Bring 'em home cause the husband a prick, that won't give her the dick
You work a six to nine, then nine to six
She take advantage cause the cameras don't capture after school field trips
But didn't recognize gossipy kids
Couple Twit pics later, Mrs. in a cell later
It's hell and the missions is given to all ages
All colors and creed can get swimsuit
Wake up in the fiery layers to no saviors
This is to say, we got the right to choose
Free will abuse, guilty consent end up front pages
Judged by the judge, judged by the people you love
Final day to the hells up above

[Hook][Reks]

[Hook]
I wanted to rock them three stripes, Timbs, and Nikes
Momma told me when I'm older I'll experience life
But now it's all grey hairs
It's all grey hairs
It's all grey hairs
It's all grey

Thought I was old enough then to know wrong from right
Momma told me when I'm older that I might see the light
But now it's all grey hairs
It's all grey hairs
It's all grey hairs
It's all grey

[Reks]
I pop bottles and read the good book
Skipped college, man
Watched top models
Cuz soon they'll be hollering
We made travels like Gulliver
Used to be kings like Solomon
Then became slaves like Tubman and then
Government wanna us see us running like Harriet
To avoid the establishment
Of prison cell blocks
Little shorties come out of the womb, ready to sell rocks
Rock charms, Jesus Christ pendant covered in ice
I guess my only advice
Is watch jewels, gems, come with a price
It's such an identity crisis
How we can cop new bank gear
Not care what the price is
Jesus hang from a cross and now he hang from your neck
Still no respect, dont' know who Christ is
We are living in times of the most critical kind
Grey hairs got visible lines

[Hook]

[Reks]
Can you sense it that hopes is missing
That the focus isn't there any longer children
Being raised by a new age
Given a new craze
They listen to the beat and nod
Disregard thoughts written
They walking dead around us pimping
And our mission is no longer to reach within 'em
Our mission should be now to decrease the tension
But instead we just give in to nature
Label hate us cuz we don't let the radios make us different
Getting grey hairs from all of that anger building
I'd be lying if I said I ain't aging and sensing
A bit of change in my ageless wisdom
What are we to do now
For the patient victims
Who just wish music would return to its senses
That we at some point would respect our mission
And give back to rap, the greatest invention

[Hook]

[Reks]
Hip-hop influences raised me
Say, for instance, Jay-Z said the streets is watching
So I kept on driving, head bobbing crazy
Though the couple in the next car upset
They couldn't make me
Turn the volume down, my volume up
And I'm a ride 'round town
Blast that volume, WHAT?!
But these days, these kids really don't give fuck
Listening to Dip Set, now they sticking you up
Take every rhyme literal, YEP!
They more criminal, PLUS
It's more reality to kill for a buck
But how can I judge?
When it's a part of the beautiful music I love
They iPods full of G-Unit, the best thugs
Next club, everybody in the cipher rhyming
Out to get rich and die trying
Dark clouds keep us out of the grey
The sun rising, looking better today
So I say...[Reks]
Now Folks listen here, R-E-K-S
Yo, we done trekked from the east coast
Get up from my dawg in San Francisco on this Gunz Still Hot Remix
Rasco, Ed O.G., livin' legends in the game
Barkin' wit' one of the young dawgs
We about to set it like this, c'mon

[Ed O.G.]
If the suns still hot, then my guns still hot
You number one wit a bullet, wit just one shot
Ass-backwards, I'm a dog spelled backwards
Who puff backwards wit tan timbs and black hoods
You gangsta, but testifying for immunity
Write your eulogy, time to close your window of opportunity
Ya career is over for major damages
Cheap labels, whack records, weak managers
Amateurs, pros get paid a fee
Niggas love the game so much they play for free
Talk shit behind my back but won't say it to me
Rasco and Reks, now which asshole is next
Ed O.G. is Boston bound
You lost ya skills and lost ya sound, now they at the lost and found
We so hot we take cold shower
Get it on for hours, compare your shit to ours...c'mon

[Rasco - Hook 2X]
Ayo, we spit it, you cats better get wit it
Nuttin' but cash man, we stay fresh-fitted
If niggas is layed out then Rasco did it
Find me at the spot wit the guns still hot

[Reks]
I spit 16 bars of the deadliest paragraphs
Take the rap game, divide it by one, and then shatter half
Use the other half for target practice
Every rap cat wit a pad and pen or iron horses turn corks to ashes
Rasco sent to spit, my gun hot wit the clip
Pistol [???], make ya heart pump, jump and then skip
R E K S wit adrenaline scripts
Keep it rockin' like the pendulum twitch, past millennium tick
Continuous wit, the coast to coast
Flows to ya throat, flows you can quote
Alls toe to toe, ready for war, my south paw will pop ya confetti jaw
This ya first taste of Reks dawg, you'll get many more
Rollin' wit two vets, and you bet we armed
I don‘t do threats, when I bark wit the dawgs I bring it on
You whack cats ya lifelines up so beg Regis
If you could make just one more call to the Lord Jesus

[Hook 2X]

[Rasco]
My six-shooter can shoot from all ways, hotter than the sun
For some we get dumb, you know where we from
C-A-B-A-Y the area
Ras' lock it down like a pitbull terrier
My Beantown recruits, rockin' black suits
For all of these whack groups, cause nigga we bout loot
You want proof? I speaks nuttin' but truth
255 feet and get shot off the roof
I be the hitman for grands
Nuttin less than the franks and grands in the hand, reppin' for San Fran
My plan is this, expand the list
Travel the globe and take the world off hold
Spit cold, my ice is froze quite nice
For that price I'm ready to pull that heist
We still precise, pin-point ya joint
Remove the groove, blown outta ya shoes
I can never lose, I bruise tracks for stacks
Of them green backs, have me a drink and lean back
And think of all them times I blew those spots
Cover ya knot because the guns still hot

[Hook 2X][Verse 1]
Hello heaven, welcome heaven, this is my life
Bye-bye to bad times, zoom in with the bright lights
Momma in the hospital bed, I see you being fed
Tube in your mouth, they claiming you dead
But instead, hello heaven, hello heaven love
Open your eyes, whispered a word
Here's what you said
You said "I'm gonna walk through the doors, get strong"
So much to fulfill in life for real
Illness making your bones succumb
But you a soldier
Soaked up power to lift and move boulders
Third rock weight on your shoulders
Feeling cold as Kris Kingle's toes is
Medication got you out of focus
So they called you hopeless
Told her she was near comatosis
Tears on your cheeks when I wrote this
Hello heaven love
Note this, momma woke with tears on her whole face
And yeah I downed a whole case
Chose to celebrate heavens gates gonna wait for her old age
So we take time to thank above
Hello heaven love

[Hook x2]
Love, love, love, love
Hello my love
Love, love, love, love
Hello heaven love

[Verse 2]
Hello heaven, welcome heaven to my world
What will convince me to leave my girl?
Baby in the belly, we arguing steady
Son here already, for another, are we ready?
My heavy thinking of the choice we made
We ain't God, judge or jury, how a life we take?
Hello my love
I'm sorry for the choice we made
The voice we played is in my brain
I can't be getting rid of my fam
If I'm to be damned and damn
So be it
Like Soviet Union, (?) music
Alleviate pain, still I'm Judas
Evil maneuvers, my baby's youth gets removed with
A decision I now consider stupid
I took your innocence
Trip to clinic with a plan to end it quick
Hello my love
Where's the benefit?
Zeeky going years not knowing what a sibling is
Venomous conscience feeling guilty all just
Trying to reminisce and get the stress off us
It's why I take time to look above
Heaven hello
Hello heaven love

"Let me stay with you, 'til the morning" (Yeah)
"Wakes the night" (R.E.K.S.)

How can it be so wrong?
(They call me Reks)
Back for the streets
When it feels so right

[Verse One]
Ayo, the east need they king back so I came to be that
Checkmate the game like chess, I came to seize rap
Never been a name like Reks, best believe dat
Wherever I aim my best, I plant a seed at
I see that
The game has changed but I'm prepared for change
Fans can relax, I won't relapse
This ain't Rekless, and with that said, where the heat at?
Nas said, "Hip hop is dead", they bringin' me back
Like Christ on the third
With the words I'm a throwback
The flows that are picturesque as Kodak
First out the arena like a gladiator
Gettin' at a hater
We the makers of the major moves without the major paper
Quiet as kept, I crept back in
Back flippin' off the roof, a suicide sentence
How do you define 'menace' without mentionin' Reks is a fallacy
Any before me, done, won't fear none after me
That's Genesis
Revelation enemy associate
Whoever get the premonition to fuck with me is over with
It's over for soldiers
Had a nice run but I'm back like spines to remind y'all who the true chosen is

[Verse Two]
Ayo, I think I can, no, no I know I can
No need to hold my hand
I got's the upper hand, I am
Son Of Sam Berkowitz
Merciless, rap verbalist
Right on cloud nine to penetrate the Earth with it
Demonstrate superb like verses
You need services?
Ghostwrite your CD if P. Diddy purchases
Hotter than a credited street journalist
Speak murderous bars that cause onslaught to y'all nervousness
Statik, I got beef with your beat
Came to murder it
Rappers got cred on the street, but ain't deservin' it
Sick of all this hip hop beef and fake murderers
Thug claimin', drug slangin', gun bangin' worshipers
2/3 of it ain't real
Peace to third who still
Keep it authentic with a raw feel
The game need a change and my aim to deliver
Until I claim my spot in hip hop's hall of fame

[Verse Three]
I think if Pac or Big Poppa was poppin' they poetry, niggas wouldn't eat
Wouldn't be so many rappers killin' on every beat
Wouldn't be so much division 'tween the west and east
Rest in peace
To Punisher, Big L, Eazy E
To MC mean to carry the torch
Guess I be, livin' proof to Stack Bundle before I D.I.E
We can drink, write songs, get lit like Bob Marley
Hope rap won't be held against me when God call me
R.E.K.S. is prolly the Marcus Garvey of artistry
Warring with leaders to get my people out of poverty
Do the knowledge, too many artists is slaughtering all the speak
History of rap is packed into my arteries
R.E.K.S
The underground, legendary
Beep, beep, hurry, hurry, MC's need to worry
You in the booth, you best beware
Cause I solemnly swear to be a problem this year

Lowest position to be is in the dirt man
I’m in that position like underneath the earth fam
See Jesse birthed Pam and Pam met David
And David just couldn’t stay, Pam couldn’t take it
Had to face it in them dirty dark slums
Where we barely saw crumbs, wishing thanksgiving come
But a lonely son stolen from God’s hands
Only homie get my plans with this dark skin, accepted outcast
Got pressured by ass before the adolescence
Malnourished, I guess it’s a blessing to understand hunger
Do other younger kids wonder where their school clothes
Handed them Skippies with holes and so my shoes froze
I was a bully, a punk, got A’s and I flunked
He got AIDS, I was shocked but didn’t comprehend
When momma said we was not infected by his sins
Yeah we was on the block but that was innocence

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Reks]

I used to beg for a place to stay, no bed
Nigga lay down on the floor and just close the eyes
No disguise, many knew I was in a bind
Sure they tried but this was my mountain to climb
Counting time thinking I’m destined to be great
See the great comes from nothing, what an obvious fate
A day late, one hundred pennies short
Smoking Newports on my way to court
Like Big he caught for an assault, I never did real time or a real crime
That’s a reason to be proud yet and still I’m feeling like
Iron Mike must have felt when he got that facial tattoo
Things I say so taboo mad at you? Nah displaced anger
Smoking, sipping Tanqueray, never met a stranger
Me an depression we are close like the star and manger
Jesus and the angels, I’m a picture painter
I ain’t shit but an egotistical bastard
See a pistol I’ll blast it, weak with peer pressure
Speak with fear bet ya, thought I had a heart of stone
Many years later rectangle box all alone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reks]

Late calls, I ain’t coming home, studio time, crashing at spots
I can see you there just watching the clock (I ain’t shit)
If I could think about myself less
And focus on the pain I’m causing at home (yes)
But I’m too selfish
Worthless and helpless, chosen to be reckless
Poisoning myself with nicotine and Hennessy
To the flesh and memory, ask a simple question
I’m raising my voice instantly, the Devil is an enemy
A liar and a friend to me, keeping em close
Is to to Hell that you’re sending me? One last toast
To the born beggar who cried himself to sleep
When Billy said men don’t weep but I wept and I slept
And I woke then I smoked then I drink but I quit
And I quote, I’m a hypocrite
Pause that shit for a sec, I need a cigarette
I ain’t shit
