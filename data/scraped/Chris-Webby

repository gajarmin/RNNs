[Verse 1]
I'm on the edge, one step and I'll be over
Unless I take those 12 steps, aimed at gettin sober
That's the shit I told myself I'll handle when I'm older
And now I'm older and still got this devil on my shoulder
Bottle up my problems, like prescriptions I'm poppin
All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often
Now these cards are dealt, told myself I don't need help
Numb myself to everything, and keep on runnin from myself

[Hook]
Let's drink away the pain
Let's make another toast
Let's smoke another blunt
Until it's just a roach
And pop another pill
And drop another dose
I haven't lost it yet
But now I'm coming close

I'm just chemically imbalanced (On that shit)
I'm just chemically imbalanced (Lost my grip)
I'm just chemically imbalanced (One way trip)
And now it's too late for turnin back (x5)

[Verse 2]
Left here to battle this addictive personality
That's got me living in this alternate reality
Losing touch with what is real ever so gradually
Cause at this point I need these chemicals to balance me
It's like I'm following a blueprint that the devil made
Since I first took my Ritalin in the 7th grade
The doctor gave me 60 milligrams, just a kid
Barely weighed a buck, it's like they used me as their guinea pig
Crazy teen, medicated ADD
Doctor said take only 1, but you know I was taking 3
Blazin tree and skippin class, getting drunk and missin math
Bangin chicks without a rubber, crushin pills up on the desk
Chemically imbalanced in this motherfucker, startin shit
Still I was a smart kid, got myself a scholarship
Private schools with it,  button-downs with the dockers
And the JanSport full of weed stuffed into my locker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See I was blacking out weekly, livin on repeat
Still in highschool but the teachers could never reach me
Always was the fuck up with a chip on my shoulder
And a pocket full of anything to keep me from sober
See I was livin like there's no tomorrow
Chewin on a xany bar, rollin up the window smokin blunts up in family car
Bottles to the head, got detention on the reg
Never listenin to what my parents said
I was always rollin with an ounce or two
Everytime I'm bouncin through
Flippin everybody off like Shady taught me how to do
Always thinkin that the more we burnin, the merrier
Just a kid from middle-class suburban America
And so many others like me, listen to me nightly
Happy that somebody else is feelin' what they might be
So Christian pop a pill, oh yeah I bet you will
Cause if that shit don't make your problems any less forreal

[Hook][Produced By:  Kato]

[Verse 1]
Listen I’m just here to kick it regardless of if you’re with
Regardless of the critics getting all up in my business
Regardless of the fact that getting here took me a minute
In this game of life, chilling with my stand-by ticket
Goddamn I did it, I built the stage to get my voice heard on
And it’s real to say
Shit I’m still a normal dude, got bills to pay
And if tomorrow’s not promised I’ma chill today
Cause like you we all bleed red, we all human
We all just tryna navigate our way through the confusion
We all just want a piece of the pie
I’m staying zooted while I’m waiting
Let me roll up a doobie and keep it moving
I got a few chinks in my armor, too
Never used to see the world, now I’m starting to
And I’m just reaching for the motherfucking stars like you
Without a joint that shit’s hard to do
So I tell em that....

[Hook]
We all gonna die one day, so what?
But while I’m kicking I’ma have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
Cause when life gets tough I shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
And we all got bills to pay, so what?
But while I’m in the green I’ll have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
And when shit gets rough I’ll shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Chilling, baking out my Chevy with my crew in the cut
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff

[Verse 2]
I’m just out here tryna function
Bobbing and weaving through the percussion
While I’m puffing on a magic dragon daily like it’s nothing
As I watch my competition and proceed to one-up em
And if they don’t like what I’m doing then, man, fuck em
And if they ain’t been down since jump I can’t trust em
Ever since my friend ratted on me and I ended up cuffed
In the back of an undercover whip
Cause my homie couldn’t help but run his lip
As soon as the fan was hit with some fucking shit
But that’s life and I’ve learned how to choose my friends better
Learned how to master my craft and be a trendsetter
Learned how to get knocked down
Learned how to get back up
I learned how to rock these crowds
Learned to accept that what’s...
...going on is a blessing beyond a logical fact
I don’t know if God is real but someone’s watching my back
Maybe it’s my boy Nick, we still miss you cuz
Next joint’s for you, now roll up

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
I’m gonna take a puff
Then I’ma blow it out
I’m gonna roll it up
And then I’ma burn it down

[Hook][Produced By: BRIX]

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Yeah I got em saying
Ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo, ohh noo

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah nigga, oh no, gin and four loko
Who you getting crazy with, ese?  You know I’m loco
Headbutting hoes like I’m ocho (cinco)
I be in the valley with the stoners and the cholos
Niggas stacking more dough, you know how that shit go
You should get a pen, write it down and take a photo
My cologne say Versace, my dick say blow me
My drawers say polo, yeah bitch polo!
Need a white girl with an ass like Coco’s
Hit that pussy right, girl I bought you some Menolo’s
That was Adderall, shit, I used to pop NoDoz
Used to have one bitch, now I got four hoes
Hi my name is Jarren, I am not normal
Aaron Schwartz in(?) that pussy, hit it like Arnold
Mr. Drummond, Willis, Kimberly, looks like a porno
Skeeted in her face, I treat that bitch just like a urinal
Webby tell these hating niggas slit they wrist
Every track we on we take a shit on it
Ladies show your tits, meet a nigga back stage
Where you’ll see me pull my dick out and lick on it
Me and Webby hurting
And we murdering any motherfucker that's looking at us sideways
Cut the body five ways
We skin em and drop em off on the highway
These pussy ass niggas so irate, we got em screaming…

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9Ne]
I was sent to  demolish and decapitate whoever thinking they killing
Doin' the hottest we activate and murder many men that make hits say god is a rapper, wait
Better bow before Nina, don’t even try to spit at the great
Sick, then I’ma get pissed, their finna get wack and fake
Bitch, get on my dick quick, give it a lick it, acclimate
Get what you’re giving, give her the gift and go gravitate
Acting a ape, I ate up a animal I aggravate
Whole lotta people getting a whiff of the Niner
They loving a nigga cause I’m a hell of a rhymer
Women are looking finer, I never decline her
She wanna climb my timer, stick it and I slime her
I get the pudding, never gotta wine and dine her
When a busta run up with a broken heart he get a shiner
When it comes to murking on music I’m a deadly designer
I’m drinking my Hennessy mixture out of a Steiner!
If he tripping I'ma buck or I’ma cut a nigga up with a machete
Cause I’m running with a gang that’ll bring that flame
With a thang and it’s heavy
You don’t wanna fuck with a Tech N9ne
Or my nigga, JB or Chris Webby
Havin everybody sayin “oh no”, bustin up the window of a 6 Chevy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
We don’t fight fair, we right here
We the reason you’ve been waking up with nightmares
Got em running, got em running
From the second they see us coming, I got em saying…

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Hold up
On your mark, ready, set, go
Look at Web flow
I be jabbing with the right and then I hit em with a left blow
Knock em back in time like they chilling with Bill and Ted, yo
To a land before time, T-Rex ho
So many bars you would think I’m living on Death Row
Webby just a motherfucking dog, where’s Petco?
Follow a plate of kibbles n bits with an egg roll
Genius in the laboratory cooking blue meth, yo
Call me Heisenberg, cause when I rhyme with words
These motherfuckers are behind the curve
I drive and swerve, turn and I ride the curb
And hit every pedestrian that doesn’t find the nerve…
...to get out of the way, “Jarren did you see that shit?”
Yeah maybe you should drive, cause the weed I hit
Got me feeling so loca, la vida, bitch
Why you even pass me that shit?
But fuck it man I am an animal, but you never seen my species
A brand new breed they discovered in CT
Homegrown bitch, yelling “feed me, feed me!”
And every listener is pressing repeat
Bitch I got a sick mind, stomach bug in the brain
Insane, you gotta keep me handcuffed with a chain
But I’ll still break out like Burt Wonderstone
So anytime you see me coming, yo, I got em yelling out..

[Hook]

[Outro]
Strange Music, Funk Volume, Homegrown
Juggernauts of this independent hip-hop shit, man
Bitch![Produced By: SAP]

[Hook]
I came to pass the blunt around (blunt around)
I fuck around (fuck around)
Pour up a full cup and chug it down
Homie that was yesterday (yesterday), so they wonder how (wonder how)
I can do this every single time I come around
But it’s so eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y

[Verse 1]
Yeah I’m puffing loud, got me buzzing now
I’m just trying to do some shit that makes my mother proud
Live from the underground, met with all the labels
And they said I could make a million dollars if I dumbed it down
But I said “fuck that!” I’ma do it Web’s way
‘Cause I’m fucking dope, well at least that’s what my friends say
Lyrically a sensei, muy caliente, comprende?
Thursday to Wednesday I be so crazy
It’s not what I try for but it’s my business
Homie you should mind yours
I couldn’t lose my mind more
Jumping out the window on the 9th floor
Now they’re saying they gotta send me to the psych ward
Straightjacketed, a battle it ain’t happenin’
That be like seeing Drake and Rampage in a cage match
And I’ve been put up on this planet to ramble and raise havoc
With a bottle and an eighth a day habit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
-O-U-N-G veteran, everytime I’m stepping in
Cold as the toes of a penguin
Bad to my skeleton, bad to the bone as I’ve ever been
Feet up on the throne that I’ve settled in
Running off of adrenaline and unprescribed medicine
Lighting up an L again and hit it til my head’ll spin
Started with a crumpled up Lincoln and now it’s Benjamins
Used to be a loser but now the world is watching Webby win
It’s so easy, veni, vidi, vici
Young Houdini, rabbit in my three piece
Used to be on YouTube, now I’m up on TV
Everybody spell it out, it’s W-E-B
Add another B-Y, you’re about to see why
I’m a giant, start my sentences with “fee-fi”
Fo fum, go dumb, putting work in
So it’s time you met the man behind the curtain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Killin’ this game since it ain’t love us
I do it so easy, it ain’t nothing, I tell em it ain’t nothing
I see you dropped your new shit but it ain’t buzzin’
I’m killing this game since it ain’t love us
I do it so easy, it ain’t nothing
I tell em it ain’t nothing, I tell em it ain’t nothing

[Hook]Yea I'm back up in this bitch just like a uterus
And I don't need no lubricated condom when I'm doing this
Always got a doobie lit
Swerve behind the wheel and maneuver it
Twenty-twenty with it, use my eyes to see the future quick
Moving shit, I'm just trying to be what I'm supposed to be
Supposedly I'm dope, St. Nicholas ain't as cold as me
The thing we got in common is I'm always with a Ho or three
Make them drop it like someone with Parkinson's carrying groceries
Cause I'm here and I rap that shit, doing shows and stacking chips
Take my shirt off when I spit that's why your girl is on my dick
Got these tats all on my body and a pocket full of piff
Fill the bong up with some ice cubes, baby take a hit
See I'm running for the title, everybody voting Webster
Drinking straight tequila out a mother fucking blender
Middle finger stay up, nobody can censor
I'm a dog always sniffing for the female gender
Friend her up on facebook and from there it's a wrap
Send a poke and then tomorrow she'll be sitting on my lap
Even back when I was broke, my girlies always had a rack
Love them big titty bitches with bodies covered in tats
It's that marijuana twister, grabbing ladies from the mixer
Then I bring them to the telly, and crack a bottle of liquor
Cause I never gave a fuck, I'm the type to bang your sister
Then go back to your crib and fuck your moms like Stiffler
I hope you get the picture, take it on your Kodak
Up in Webby's World you cannot reach me with a road map
To find it you need Adderall, Ambien, and some Prozac
Always cooking fire, someone show me where the stoves at
Keep on dropping heat, all you players grab your cleats
Cause I'm in this game to win it, I won't settle for defeat
From the suburbs to the streets, I will stand by what I speak
And I don't even know what this bitch is saying up on the beat
But I got a hundred bars on me
Everything that we throw on the credit card's on me
Every drink that we get at the titty bar's on me
And I'll be living just like this until my heart don't beat
Bitches it's Chris Webby, that whitey who spit deadly
With my foot up on the pedal like I'm Mario Andretti
Fucker I rap flames and murder the rap game
Spitting 'til I'm number one with a bullet like Max Payne
Got that Nerf gun tucked and I'll aim it at your gut
Better duck, it's that cracker and slapper of big butts
Getting drunk, always looking for some double D cups
But in the lab I cook it up like I'm WolfGang Puck
Get up in the game and I go straight ham
When I get the rock up in my hand
Cause I'm here to get it popping just exactly how I planned
Take a stand right here for this rapping shit
And keep my lyrics accurate
Test me but beating Webby just simply will never happen bitch
Salute me cause truly I be the dopest on the chords
Master Yoda with the bars, I'm a Jedi with the force
That's cause Webby done got that flow
They can act like they don't know
But they ain't fucking with me period yo

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
C Web in the booth and I speak it real
Got another beat to kill
And I be roasting motherfuckers
Rest In Peace Patrice O'Neil
Roll up another blunt
Now how that Diesel feel?
Got me swerving man
Who the fuck gave me the wheel?
Who the fuck gave me these pills?
Now I'm off in another dimension
In need of an intervention
Cause these drugs are too fucking expensive
But I'm feeling terrific dude
Banging these broads with no fucking protection
Yeah, what were you saying babe?
I wasn't paying any fucking attention
Rumbling engine, rolling up in my Camaro and cruise
Living it like a pirate man
Always got me a barrel of booze
Skipping the food
Go right for the tiramisu
Sippin' and rippin' the bubbler
Puffing until I can barely move
Lay back and then stare at the moon, ooh
Bippidy bobbidy boo
Webby be rippin' it properly too
Hipping and hopping and rambling shit
Cause these pills I've been popping have got me confused
Screwed up, burn it down
Light it up, pass it around
I'm a bad boy bitch
You didn't know? You know it now

[Hook]
We just doin' what we doin', and we'll never give a fuck
Put some liquor in my bottle and some ganja rolled up
We just livin' like whatever and we'll never have enough
Bout to get this motherfucker turned up (turned up)

Like nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
I'm not the one you want a problem with
Positive, you better follow it
Swear I'm ready for whatever standing in front of my mirror
Supporting my confidence
A little weed, you could throw it on top of this
We get it poppin', yo bitch gettin' topless
Now that you know, niggas adopting the flow
Niggas can't stop this shit
The problem is we won't acknowledge it
But me and Webby (I wanna get that)
If that nigga wanna get mad, sit up and get up
And fuck that (get that)
Now I'm playing like a kid on the black top
Got the juice with a flat top
You got a flat face
Bad boy, it's a bad day
Look at me sideways, and I'mma hit you with a uppercut
Too cold, better bundle up
Huddle up cause we comin' up
Turnt up, finna fuck it up
I guarantee that the crowd go crazy
When I hit the stage, you could bet a hunnit bucks
Boy we out here grindin'
Smoking the finest, getting the highest
Getting the mommas, you know when I'm coming
Just smell for the ganja
Vegas; soldierz, takin' over
Traveling and taking shots
Tattoo shops, don't forget the place to rock
I need a nasty girl to taste the cock
In the office, running all over these niggas
Like bitches, you niggas is softer than niggas
That just got to prison, this Project X shit is real
Somebody pass the god damn liquor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
That rap phenomenon
Inked up, looking like Comic Con, Rasta mon
H.A.M. on the mic, no Ramadan
Go on and on, and leave with a soccer mom
Cause I kill that beat
Roll one up in that Swisher Sweet
Sticky green, sticky green
With orange hairs, like Pete and Pete
Flowing double time when I freak the beat
Holding up mine when I hit the street
Burn so much, I be high for weeks
Spit it so dirty, I need new sheets
My grinder's full, and I ain't talkin turkey, cheese
I'm talking AK47, Purple Kush and Sour D
Put it in the bowl, I'll get a dutchie rolled
Sprinkle some keef on it, and then away we go
Get in the flow, lighting up heady to dro
Partying on, got that confetti to throw
Killing the spot from the moment
That Webby'll step in the door
Hit some shit, got my pencil gripped
Instrumental ripped, living life
Above the law, and way under the influence
Getting mine while the price high
What can I say? I'm pretty fly for a white guy

[Hook]I'm never rated G
(Sound Cutoff)[Used???]every swear from A to Z
Since way before the show was first hosted by both AJ and Free
And at this point I think these rappers are afraid of me
Up in the cypher by myself like guys why won't you play with me?
But I dont stress it
Ima' spit and teach em' a lesson
And show them that Connecticut's here, there's no question
I kill the mic from the very moment I step in
About as often as future re-use and pitch correction
I am
A freak of nature
Write these words on a piece of paper
And when I drop it, it's guaranteed it'll leave a crater
A season change, flowing a hundred degrees or greater
So amped up I do stuff and can't remember the reason later
I rap for all kinds of people just check my client list
Rapping like I never left the 90's, on my grimey-ish
I had the RZA teach me how to throw the iron fist
Now your off your feet like a podiatrist required it
Huh
Beat you in your effin' skull with a giant stick
Like I'm Donatello so really I wouldn't try it trick
Show you what time it is
So let me in the cipher
And spit fire off the top like Nick Cage in Ghost Rider Kid
Rep the Suburbs
Everyday we ****
And drink alot of beer and party
Until we see the sun sir
Cable television said no cuss words
Still I am a monster
Keep hiding under your covers[Intro]
Oo yeah, this some super villain shit
I like it
Yo, it's C Webby

[Verse]
These people rate my music triple X
With all the X I rap about, and add the fact I'm getting all your bitches wet
You wanna come at the best, then bring a bigger bed
Cause I'm a rottweiler dawg, you a Giga Pet
I bag O's like General Mills
Now I'm on a paper chase for those federal bills
But you know it's Chris Webby, you could listen what I'm speaking
I got paper in my pocket, the shit to roll my weed in
You know I get it popping, I'm dropping, I stay nice
When I'm rocking on the mic, and yeah fuck it, I am white
But I got a lot of weed and we 'bout to give it a light, mon
Chilling here with mics on, blowing up like pipe bombs
That's just how I'm going, i'm coming for the throne
So fuck it I'm home, rapping with Muggsy Malone
We back in the booth, and yo they can't see me
It's CT, and on the mic i'm a Web MD
I'm like a surgeon, I'm that dude on Google that you be searching
And no one ever messing, cause you know that I be hurting
Any motherfucker stepping it, you'll be resting bitch
In peace that is, yeah I'm coming out Connecticut
You know I'm coming through, you fuck with me you getting slaughtered
I'm a genius, why the fuck you think I'm drinking Smart Water?
I be going in and rapping the shit
No one could say that I'm not off of the top when I come through chilling with Sway
I be going, and they think it's again like Doomsday
Cause I go in off the top and like hey
You know I'm coming through and doing that shit when I be dropping nice
Eyes bugging out of they head like Rocko's Modern Life, I go in
And add some Nickelodeon, I'm flowing and nobody controlling him
You know I got the sodium, a lot of salt up on my french fries
Don't test guys, I'll knock you down as easy as I swat flies
I'm coming in, I got the six piece up there at Popeye's
And swap spit with your fucking bitch on my dick when I be coming ridiculous
No one be coming and I'm wrapping shit up just like a Christmas gift
It just be coming, you know I'm coming through
And no one ever fucking with me, it's Chris W
I'm from the burbs, they like "Yo, he ain't from the hood so he ain't spitting shit"
Well if that's your fucking theory that's ridiculous
Because I'm nice, and you know that I be rhyming cool
And yes I did go to motherfucking private school
I know a lot, yeah I had a fucking scholarship
And yeah I had your mother too, and she hollered quick
And then I made her spit, but she swallowed it
No one ever stopping, beating me is just preposterous, dawg
I'm coming new, you know that I'm writing
Coming with lightning like this is fucking Clash of the Titans
I'm fucking ill, when I be flowing no one ever be holding me
You know nobody dope as me, repping 2-0-3
That's just where I'm coming from, and I'm stunting son
Hands around your bitch like a cummerbund
You know I'm going in, that's just how I'm rapping
Beating me don't happen, I'm the next Eric Clapton
With the shit I spit with passion, ripping them apart
Like Apocalypto I'll be standing at the top of your heart, bitchYea, this is where I show you how nice I am. 50 bars

I rip up the mic dirty, battle anybody who's worthy
The only player out with a CT jersey
You see me, heard me, felt me, purely
The sickest on the earth, ain't no shit to cure me
I am surely, a rhyme busta, fuck ya
If you go against the kid then I'll have to crush ya
Knock you down like a gust of wind if fists touch ya
Cause I always stay on my grind like Chad Muska
Take that suckas, hit em with brass knucks
And kick em with Tims on and fuck that ass up
I eat em like Pac Man, the score just adds up
Should be in a trash can, shit I'm grouchy as fuck, yup
I'll wrap my hands around your neck and choke ya
Shock ten thousand volts, Zeus lightnin' bolt ya
So keep your courage close if I go and approach ya
Cause I'm here to "Face Off" like Nick Cage and Travolta
Spit molten flows that shatter your chest
Leave you with a broken nose for a lack of respect
So please son, if you really wanna battle the best
I'll put your fuckin' life in "Jeopardy" like Alex Trebek, yes
I'm not your average vet, blastin' a TEC
I'll ravage your set, beat you up like masochist sex
I never met another rapper of my caliber yet
But them beatin' me is like me passin' an Algebra test
I be flippin' like a calender, lyrics be scorchin' em
Rap valedictorian, swingin', stingin' like scorpions
Skin whiter than porcelain, but bringin' them dark forces in
Sick like the shit they caught on the Trail to Oregon
I'm talkin' Cholera, Scarlet Fever, and Dysentery
It's scary, you'd swear to god I memorized the dictionary
I'm buyin' if the "Price is Right" with Drew Carey
Fairly out of my mind got you runnin' like Tom and Jerry
I am very mentally nuts, spit with quickness
Step to a bitch like baseball, designated to hit this
Got your head spinnin' like kickflips, when I rip this
Hardbody like my flows lift weights at Planet Fitness
You can't get with this shit Chris spit I'm this sick hit piff
Till I'm flyin' through the air quick as a discus
You simply can't dismiss this, ready to go the distance
In the booth feelin' like a fuckin' kid on Christmas
This is, me back and fresh as can be
Hell I got more kicks than the UFC
More kicks than Jet Li, or Tekken 3
I'm nice, anybody I've ever met could agree
Could it be? The dude who's droppin' analogies
Hustlin' to make a salary, and burnin' opponents quick as a calorie
I will glad-a-ly, charge up the battery
And swing with a bat and see if I can knock your ass straight out the galaxy
Fact not fallacy, I rapidly drop shit
Pilot in the cock pit and sure as a clock ticks
I'll be here throwin' more fists than a mosh pit
50 bars later and I'm still spittin' hot shit

Yea bitch, I'm nice!Yeah, put your bottles of Adderall in the air
This to everybody with A.D.D
You know you got it, ha, listen, listen

[Verse 1]
I got Attention Deficit Disorder, I ain’t kiddin' em'
Don’t know where I’d be without the Adderall and Ritalin
Poppin’ them shits three at a time in heavy dosages
And go back to the doctor like, I still can’t focus bitch
That’s right, It’s the A.D.D
Got officially tested in upstate CT
And after I did my part
The dude went to my parents and was like
Hmm, where do I start
His levels are off the charts
This shit is killin’ me, but still I rap it skillfully
Even with a certified mental disability
I know ya'll feelin’ me, it’s drivin' me mad
Got A.D.D so bad, I can’t even add

[Hook]
I can’t pay attention to nothing, end of discussion
I just got that A.D.D, A.D.D, A.D.D
I just got that A.D.D
And teacher I know that I can’t focus
Whatcha gotta know it’s just that A.D.D
A.D.D, A.D.D, I just got that A.D.D

[Verse 2]
I day dream more than Lupe, sing a different tune
Space out, eye fuckin' that biddy across the room
It’s true I’m not messin', this shit would get you stressin’
Teachers callin’ on me I’m like, uh, could you repeat the question
I don’t pay attention, I miss out on every lesson
Get lost cause I wasn’t listenin' when I got the directions
Start typing in my phone, and then forget who I was textin'
Zone out during sex and lose my fuckin' erection
I really hate this, constantly misplace shit
Losin' my wallet, phone, or keys, on a day to day basis
It’d probably help If every night I didn’t get wasted
And high enough to be a passenger aboard a space ship
But since I do, then fuck it
Even though losing my scholarship is not within my budget
Cause son I’m not playin’
I, uh, shit, I forgot what I was sayin’

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My brain just doesn’t work cause of all the drugs I’ve done
Plus the A.D.D. to the point that thinkin' even hurts
Teachers try to talk to me as if I am gonna hear it
All I do is crack jokes, space out, and write lyrics
My brain’s unraveled over time like a rope does
Lost my mind like the change in your sofas
But I don’t gotta take my meds to spit it dope cause
All they do is give me dry mouth and a coke buzz
So what? I can’t focus but it’s straight
At least I got a good excuse when all of my work is late
Maybe can’t pay attention, but there is still a place
In my brain that allows me to murder a mixtape
Wait, maybe it ain’t even so bad after all
Fuck all the doctors, I don’t need to pop an Adderall
I’ll just be a rapper and such to make bucks
But if that doesn’t work, uhh, I guess I’m fucked

[Hook][Hook]
Listen boys and girls to the song I say
And the story I’m about to tell
It’s about a guy who had lost his way
And in the end wound up by himself
Cause I met a lot of girls in my travels
Had my share of the one-night stands
But I’m still alone at the end of the day
Riding solo through the badlands
All by myself

[Verse 1]
Still looking for my Juliet
But no one’s introduced me yet
And love ain’t nothing like they show you on the movie sets
Me, I’m just a loner that’s just always how it’s been
But no one-night stand can replace having a friend
And fucking all these bitches ain’t gon fill the emptiness
Now I’m depressed waking up from my dreams in a heavy sweat
Does my Juliet exist, shit have we already met?
Kept my heart locked away and now my fucking head’s a mess
And it’s my fault because any woman who’s ever loved me
They moved on cause they wanted more than a fuck buddy
And now it’s busy rapping trying to make myself some money
Great, now that I got it ain’t nobody here but me
So when I meet a lady now it just ain’t the same
She already knows my name
And it change the rules of the game
Half these girls up at the open bar are only trying to bone a star
So for the rest of my life I won’t know what their motives are

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It’s not that I dislike women, that’s not what I’m trying to say
But when emotion gets involved I just tend to push them away
My mood is always flippin’ you would think I’m bipolar
Half the time I’m just too high to remember what I told her
Chemically imbalanced cause I lived my life reckless
And taking all those drugs throughout my fucking adolescence
It was my choice, so when I’m acting crazy I don’t blame you
I’m the reason for all the shit that I’ve put my brain through
If I seem distant in the bed after I hit it
It’s because I don’t know how to love and nobody can fix it
So this is my apology to every girl who’s loved me
I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you wanted ladies trust me
Am I afraid of happiness? Why don’t I even try?
I’m so passive with these women that they passing me by
All that sloppy drunk and rough sex and I could give a fuck less
Cause I still ain’t found love yet

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thinking bout my love life as I look back
But I’m still a fucking one-man wolf pack
So many things that I’ve done I wish that I took back
So many moves I didn’t make I probably should have
But that’s life and now I really now how shit is
All those years being a player fucking these bitches
But after all the parties and the shows and the models
I’m still alone and nothing but stories in a bottle

[Hook][Hook- Miss Daja]
They say, They say this life is gonna chew you up and spit you right back out

But this games all I know about and I know it ain't fair

But I’m almost there, I know I’m almost there

[Verse 1- Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I’m feeling stuck really what the fuck, I kill it with the lyrics while I struggle for a buck
I’m frustrated, feelin like I shoulda just made it
Making money off of shows but can't even make a payment on a new whip
On the edge I’m really bout to lose it
But the fans keep me motivated I know I can do this
It’s funny, seems like everybody focusing on the lyrical content but I’m barely seeing any money
I’ll leave your nose runny cause I’m so sick yo
Still scrapin together quarters to get bogies down to sicko
I know this life has more in store for me, and if it don't then I'll put a pistol to my temple with nobody forcing me
It’s costing me blood,sweat, and tears and I hate the shit
I love the game this ain't just tryin' to make me rich
I love you hip-hop simple as that
But how much would it hurt to show a little love back

[Hook]

[Verse 2- Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I been chilling in the basement underground
They in the master bedroom throwin bucks around
Trynna be original every time I drop a rap
But all these labels lookin for another copy cat
Anyone say I’m bitin' Asher or Sam Adams swagger is gettin' knocked out if I catch yas
It's bullshit I've been doing this my whole life
And you say I’m jockin him just because were both white
They say "he's good" but he's no Slim Shady
Well how come every black rapper ain't compared to Jay-Z
I never said I was better than Em-kid
In my humble opinion Marshall's the best that's ever lived
I’m trynna do me and create my own lane
And though the haters gossip at least they’re sayin my name
And if I don't make it then life ain't fair but uh at least I know I was almost there

[Hook]

[Verse 3- Chris Webby]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So many damn shows I’m basically on tour
So fuck these labels if they ain't knockin at my door
My grass roots fan base is bigger than these dudes that are signin
This is crazy am I losin my mind
Dropped five mixtapes in a year and a half
No Pop-Tart shit
You hear that it's rap
And here are the facts
I grind harder than most of these dudes do
Always got new shit posted on YouTube
Shout to Khalifa cause me and him are supplying the most free music to your speakers
And if you ain't likin it shut your mouth bite your lip
I can't be stopped there's too much fuckin fightin Chris
This is history pen and hand writin this
Poseidon with the flow
King Triton bitch
So close I can taste it
I'll make it
Haters smoke a blunt by yourself and just face it

[Hook][Verse One: Chris Webby]
Got my life on repeat, man, the beat goes on
Nikes flat up on the street, and I keep those on
Recharged and rebuilt, I can speak no wrong
Don't like me? Then fuck you, like that Cee Lo song
Two middle fingers up; ambidextrous
Fightin' for my freedom of speech, but then they censor it
Killin' any microphone in sight just for the heck of it
Chris Webby, bitch, still reppin' for Connecticut
Lets get the shit
I've been back on the road and going hard
Venue after venue, showin' 'em that I flow with no regard
Now I'm makin' money, got more green than Oprah's yard
Got these people like "Aaiyo, you really think he wrote these bars?"
How would you feel if you were on top
With a couple thousand motherfuckers aimin' for your spot?
But I am where I am, I'mma keep it on lock, baby, so lets rock

[Hook: Daniel Zavaro]
Oh, baby, don't you see I'm fallin'
Looking down, and I feel like I belong
Turn it down, again, you keep talking
And the beat goes on

[Verse Two: Chris Webby]
See the beats still going on, Webby rock it so terrific
With a flow that be colder than the Nagano Olympics
Made a little dough, put some lobster on my dishes
Picking up the flow and then I drop it on you bitches
Motherfucking guillotine, you won't have your head attached
When I step up on the stage and people sayin' "Webbys back!"
Can't stand the whack shit so I'll wreck a track
And spend my Friday murdering Rebecca Black
And I still be the one you fuckers feel
And I won't stop 'til I got myself a couple mil'
In the building, and I'll show you how it's done for real
Revolutionary shit, Battle for Bunker Hill
But instead of red coats, I'm killing MC's
And anybody dumb enough to go against me
Heavyweight champ like Jack Dempsey
Shit, you better step, B

[Hook: Daniel Zavaro][Verse 1]
Let me set it off cause it's going down
Now I said it, killing beats so producers look around for a medic
I'm the reason Casey Anthony got off without a sentence (I did it)
Plus I'm the reason Snooki got pregnant
Hustle these others cause these fuckers are under my league
They just mad that everyone this summer is bumpin' to me
Jugular punch I'm just like the WWE
Pulling off the rubber and I'll come in your mother for free
Shout to the Workaholics cause I'm a wizard
Drinking liquor till I got my fucking head in a pisser
Puking up my chicken dinner and a piece of my liver
And without brushing my teeth I'm making out with your sister, huh
Cause Webby don't brawl or fight fair
That's why they're falling off like Walter White's hair
Haunt your nightmares I'm givin them cold sweats
I'm at it again, now let the story progress!

[Hook]
See, Webby in the booth then I'm at it again
All I need it's a fucking pad and a pen
I said I'm at it again
Everybody go ahead of your friends
And let the mutant ninja rapper begin
Said I'm at it again
Super villain coming back at the end
I'm on top now, I'm laughing at them
I said I'm at it again
I'm at it again, I'm at it again
I'm at it again, again, again

[Verse 2]
You see, I'm running for title
They running for class president
Burn every last remnant, up in the lab getting in
Pick up the pad, letter it, don't need no swag etiquette
Connecticut, get ready and never give my rap sedative
Foul mouth, mother fucker, better learn to deal with it
Banging Tilla Tequila, then blow a load on Mila's tits
Pull up to your grandmother's house and I make her feel my dick
Milf hunter bitch, I'm as sick as they get
I'll be sipping on my bottle, in a room at the Ritz
With a cougar and shit, holding up a doobie and piff
I don't need no blood test just to prove that I'm sick
I'm fucking loony see me howling at a lunar eclipse
Wolfman like Del Torro, body bigger than Goro
Finish me? My combat styles are mortal
Always rolling deep, bitch better bring a snorkel
Hungry for the money, and I gotta have a fork-full

[Hook][Intro]
Yeeeeaaah, Webby

[Hook]
I've been going hard, all these years been on the low
Used to show up to the spot and they would stop me at the door
Now my name is hot so they be acting like they know
And they leading my right through those velvet ropes
Now I got them saying, aww naww, who the hell let Webby in
Aww naww, who the hell let Webby in
Aww naww, so run and tell your friends
It's time to get it started mother fucker, let the games begin

[Verse 1]
Oh hello, hi there, back in the ring, never fight fair
I swear, shades on tint, never seeing through my eye-wear
No button down but I'm sleeved up, so many shows and I fly there
And my fans be getting them tickets quicker than pissing in public in Times Square
That nightmare on your street, stay with the hash like corned beef
And I light it up and I breathe it and my blunt be full of that four leaf
We killing this and I'm on my grind, running shit I got sore feet
24 deep on my tour bus, rolling right out to the floor seats
I'm blowing up what are you doing, sitting at home and YouTubing
Hating on me from a laptop, but these type of people I'm used to em
You ain't doing shit but smoking weed, watching porn, got no degree
You're a disappointment and blame everybody else that you never got where you hoped to be
See I worked for it, you sat back, I grinded out while you relaxed
And now you like; "Fuck Webby man, yo, I should be where he's at, wait is that him, did he just cut the line, wait where's Denise at?"
But I ain't gotta say nothing back, cause I got your girlfriend on my lap

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somebody turn my mic on, throw in that beat I could ride on
Shut up and listen cause fuck it I'm spitting so cold blooded, python
Connecticut over to Saigon, looking at me as if I am an icon
Getting that dough like I started with Tae-Kwon
Drinking this gin they be calling me Qui-Gon
Started out in that small time, mixtapes in the trunk of the car that I was driving in
That Altima, with back bumper hanging off the side, people honking at me (get off the road!)
Getting pulled over so often I'd have my registration at all times, hanging out my window like
Sorry guy, I know I was speeding, I'm fucking high, but my plates are good and I'm fucking dry
Smoked all my weed on my way down here, we ain't got no charges? Fuck you, bye
Peel off in that shit box, so kick rocks, I'm out of here
Then head back to my parents house and get drunk until I run out of beer
But that was then, now I'm living differently
The clubs that would always turn me away, now they all let me in for free
The girls that used to blow me off, now they all on their friggin' knees
Still blowing me off, only difference? Now it's literally

[Hook][Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Axe murder a beat the way I spit a free
Lizzie Borden in the flesh come and get at me
Like the witch of the west, I roll wickedly
Can’t see me like Paranormal Activity
Lickidy split, I rip shit quick-ily
Get ya camcorder out, bitch just picture me
Killin’ shit everyday till you get sick of me
Cause I been a beast, since the priest christened me
Blowin’ up ya tape deck, C.T. to Great Neck
Dutch full of O.G. Kush and some Train Wreck
Safe sex? nah, I’m too raw
I stick it in they jaws and I get ‘em out they draws
I’m a boss and break laws but never take a loss
Flyer than macaws, I’m just doin’ it because
I’m the best to do this within my age bracket
Waka Flocka, Soulja Boy: none of ‘em can match it
That’s it, jot it down, print it up and fax it
And tell all your boys how Webby spit the madness
Got pussy goin' nuts like I got some catnip
More than a tad sick, I murder ‘em for practice
Do what I do when I…BURN
Then ya gonna Puff Puff Pass, it’s my…..TURN
I throw down with titans, I’m rhymin’ more
More bars than a phone in a Verizon store
Bitch, I’m bigger than a body of a dinosaur
I’m crazy, who would ever blow a line before
Goin’ into a math test, energetic as ever
And all I wrote down was my name, it’s "Chris Webster"
Too drugged up to pay attention in class
So I got kicked out and put my focus on rap
But don’t do like I do, cause I’m fucked in the head
All these un-prescribed meds, now I need special ed
I’m a beast, I’m a dog, I’m a mothafuckin’ pot head
Nerf Gun in my hand, step and you’ll be shot dead
Still mothafuckin’ crazy, don’t doubt me
Pocket full of lint, pack of bogies and my house keys
Aw, jeeze, I be burnin’ the palm trees
Keystone Light to your fuckin’ Dom P
Lazy kid, I still live with my mom, see
Smokin’ bud sleepin’ late, playin’ Nazi Zombies
28 days later, see me in the paper
I’m a mix of Stewie Griffin with a little Darth Vader
Leave a crater in the earth when I drop my mixtape
The north star ain’t this hot for shit’s sake
Chase a 40 o.z. with a box of fish flakes
They might forget my name but they’ll remember how my dick taste
Dictate the scene at all times
Cause the ninja rapper’s back with an Optimus Rhyme
You Underclassmen can’t see The White Noise, bitch
That’s why my mixtape’s bumpin’ in ya boy’s whip
Oh shit, I spit and wreak havoc
My vocal chords like twin Glocks, let me blast it
Cause if anybody steps then I’ma bury ‘em
C.T.’s on my back and I’ma carry ‘em
Smoke blunts till my IQ’s very dumb
Stay high like the water bill at an aquarium[Hook: Apathy]
Ray Bans, boat shoes, J Crew, I’m back in New England
Seersucker, seafood, attitude, I’m back in New England
B&B’s, yacht clubs, hot tubs, I’m back in New England
Cape Cod, Block Island, Nantucket, I’m back in New England

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Murder on Martha’s Vineyard, they found a body
It’s early morning, the water’s choppy and real foggy
Found Bobby face down on the dock
With his brains blown out, family still in shock
They heard the pop, pop, pop, pop
Knock ‘em out the box, cops knocking
And they got their doc where they heard the shots
But they never caught the murderer searching along the rocks
They probably dropped the weapon down to the lobster pots
And the locals know where and which hoes go to get the blow
Blow for blow, you can hear the story on the radio
Waking up, ache is up, anything to make a buck
Fluke till we puke, rubber boots and an 80’s truck
Fuck bitches, get money, buddy, I’mma get
All them trashy hoes numbers in Misquamicut
I’m so Connecticut
Cashable, the actual, factual
Most of y’all raps way too vaginal

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I don’t even gotta say it, motherfucker
‘Cause you know the state that I’m in
Connecticut since my family came up from Ellis Island
From Michigan and Avellino till they hit the port
At the Statue of Liberty then they went up north
My momma's maiden name Palumbo
Been in Newark since jump yo
The same city we ride around when we got the blunt roll
My hometown watch me graduate up from a freshman
Representing for Connecticut, presidents every second
I’m New England through and through
My dad grew up in Mass
Back in Worcester in the 60's with his guitar strap
Over his shoulder
Fast-forward
Now I’m on the same path
Grew up right here in New England, ‘bout to put us on blast
Where I’m at we got teenage drinking in large quantities
House parties and kegs and destroying somebody’s property
Crazy fucking debauchery, there’s nothing like it, honestly
So step over the state line, see how we get it popping, B

[Hook]

[Outro]
I remember thinking, as the cold water rushed in around my head, that I was in certain drowning. Cold water in my lungs and I actually felt the sensation of drowning. Somehow I struggled to the surface alive. I made immediate and repeated efforts to save Mary Jo by diving into the strong and murky currents but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion[Verse 1]
I'm the Hip-Hop antichrist, they'll regret it if they hand me mics
Jack The Ripper, huntin' bitches down by candle light
Changing the standard of nice, brandish a knife
I'm what's crackin' like I'm tightenin' ya hand in a vice
Huh! My flow nasty, get a Tampax
So many bars you would think I was flippin' Xanax
Fuck caterin' the bitches when I spit yo
Go and listen to Drizzy you dumb bimbo
This is real rappin' Webby flow it with a passion
Get these letters in my brain and cause a chemical reaction
Droppin' vowels and consonants, powerfully rockin' it
With enough force to level a continent
What I'm droppin' is the right way, I got em' guessin' what I might say
Go bananas like Johnny Drama and Andrew Dice Clay
Since the 9th grade Webby's been a psychopath
Headphones on in detention when I was writin' raps
Queue the lightnin' crash, queue the smoke machines
A factor you should fear, even Joe Rogan screams
Dopamine and adrenaline till' I'm hemorrhagin'
The fuckin' villain's back in this bitch, you better remember him

[Hook]
Say good night to the bad guy
No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why
I'll be here until they bury me and thats why
They know to run when they see me
I'm the motherfucka haunting your dreams
I'm the motherfuckin' bad guy
No fuckin' around, don't got to ask why
I'll be here until they bury me and thats why
They no to run when they see me
I'm they motherfucka haunting your dreams

[Verse 2]
You can catch me where the wild things be at
Hit em' so quick they can't react, even an Atheist would believe that
Fuck shootin' guns, I fire cannon balls
With the physical strength of a Neanderthal
Roar! I'm a Tyrannosaurus Rex
Start by beatin' up the verses and I'll slam the chorus next
Got a standard for success and for me it's bein' the best
The games like a bench presser, let me get it off my chest
I'm a vet, but I ain't checkin' on the healthiness of any K-9s
I'm giving you the news bitch, NBC dateline
Hear me through the grapevine, murderin' tracks
Leave you layin' in the bed where they do surgeries at
I been the hottest dude under the sun
Beatin' me? You got a better chance fuckin' a nun
Fuck it I'm done, got my competition on the run
Won't be happy till' I'm number one, deadly with the tongue
Rap bandito doing' coke by the kilo
The mad super villain is back, Magneto
So bow down to me or get eaten like sushi
So fuck you and have a great day, Yours truly

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah...Webby
I drop 50 bars, mad bars, raised the bar twice
The bars are on me all night
If they wanna go bar for bar we can do it on sight
I'm a beast, you're gonna never see me lose a bar fight

[Verse 1]
Everyone got an opinion but they won't step up
Can do a fucking handstand still got no leg up
So go ahead, talk your shit, yo, come on get tough
I'll Instagram a dick pic, you could all get fucked
I'm still as sick as a malaria patient, I'm very impatient
Stomping up the stairs of the basement (I'm coming)
No hibernation, yo, this bear is awakened
And half the game be softer than what Ben and Jerry are making
I'm a transcendentalist with literary arrangements
Vocabulary is like a dictionary replacement
But they only talking money and they last time I was checking
The greater percentage of America is in a recession (hold up) (what)
So what you're sayin' is these diamond crusted necklaces
And convoluted messages is really what you're messing with
Where's the dope shit what happened to that
Back when people stepped up to the mic and actually rapped
But now I'm on it, been here for a minute, and now I'm back to get them
Had this devil on my shoulder during catechism
Staying high from the purple and the hash I'm hitting
Brain moving slower than Rick Ross' metabolism
I'm here to rap a rhythm, so why you saying shit (why)
So many fucking punch lines, I'm about to break my wrist
Undefeated, yo, I'm hard to be playing with
I'm the king, alter alias is Marcus Aurelius
Killing beats, murder scene, and I'm washing my hands carefully
Scrubbing all the blood out the trunk of the Grand Cherokee
In need of therapy but the doctor's scared of me
Says I need a trip to Shutter Island cuz apparently
I've lost my damn mind,yo, I'm sick in the head
The reason women say that chivalry's dead
I'm that guy, trying to find some company laying in misery's bed
Staying blunted with a fifth to the head
Judge Dredd with a weapon now, laser beam flow bout to blast that
Mother fucking lyricist, you can hashtag that
Freestyle crazy, they like; "Yo, how he rap that?"
So hot off the top, I'll melt the plastic in my snapback
In a hatchback running people over till your body parts are stuck in my motor
Never sober, I got to charge my G-Pen like 12 times every weekend
Sharks and minnows with it always treading in the deep end, shit who needs friends
I got my headphones, an iPod, rhyme book and a pen, homes
Shit, I even got bars in a dead zone
I get it crackin' like chiropractors with neck bones
Shit, I been slept on, way too fucking long now
Studied every fork in the road taking the long route (yes sir)
Mapped it out like cartography, build my bridges strong
And now I know that anyone that stomps at me will tremble in my hands
Run them off my lands, see I always stuck it to the man
Fuck it, cuz I can, bringing out the ruckus is my plan
Puffing on a gram, if you want some trouble I'm your man
Comfortably stand right where I'm at
Soon to be legend, ain't no fighting the facts
About to rise to be a mother fucking titan of rap
Give them pieces of my soul and put my life in a track
In the game where people quick to put that knife in your back
Gotta teach yourself to move like a wolf or get preyed on
Fuck blowing up the real challenge is to stay on
You must be fucking stupid if you take on
This crazy white boy, keep my game face on
And my shades on, and my brim low, and my mind right
Cooking up a sick flow, chewing through my leash, now see the kid go
Because now we here bitch, welcome to the showYea I'm back up in this bitch just like a uterus
And I don't need no lubricated condom when I'm doing this
Always got a doobie lit
Swerve behind the wheel and maneuver it
Twenty-twenty with it, use my eyes to see the future quick
Moving shit, I'm just trying to be what I'm supposed to be
Supposedly I'm dope, St. Nicholas ain't as cold as me
The thing we got in common is I'm always with a Ho or three
Make them drop it like someone with Parkinson's carrying groceries
Cause I'm here and I rap that shit, doing shows and stacking chips
Take my shirt off when I spit that's why your girl is on my dick
Got these tats all on my body and a pocket full of piff
Fill the bong up with some ice cubes, baby take a hit
See I'm running for the title, everybody voting Webster
Drinking straight tequila out a mother fucking blender
Middle finger stay up, nobody can censor
I'm a dog always sniffing for the female gender
Friend her up on facebook and from there it's a wrap
Send a poke and then tomorrow she'll be sitting on my lap
Even back when I was broke, my girlies always had a rack
Love them big titty bitches with bodies covered in tats
It's that marijuana twister, grabbing ladies from the mixer
Then I bring them to the telly, and crack a bottle of liquor
Cause I never gave a fuck, I'm the type to bang your sister
Then go back to your crib and fuck your moms like Stiffler
I hope you get the picture, take it on your Kodak
Up in Webby's World you cannot reach me with a road map
To find it you need Adderall, Ambien, and some Prozac
Always cooking fire, someone show me where the stoves at
Keep on dropping heat, all you players grab your cleats
Cause I'm in this game to win it, I won't settle for defeat
From the suburbs to the streets, I will stand by what I speak
And I don't even know what this bitch is saying up on the beat
But I got a hundred bars on me
Everything that we throw on the credit card's on me
Every drink that we get at the titty bar's on me
And I'll be living just like this until my heart don't beat
Bitches it's Chris Webby, that whitey who spit deadly
With my foot up on the pedal like I'm Mario Andretti
Fucker I rap flames and murder the rap game
Spitting 'til I'm number one with a bullet like Max Payne
Got that Nerf gun tucked and I'll aim it at your gut
Better duck, it's that cracker and slapper of big butts
Getting drunk, always looking for some double D cups
But in the lab I cook it up like I'm WolfGang Puck
Get up in the game and I go straight ham
When I get the rock up in my hand
Cause I'm here to get it popping just exactly how I planned
Take a stand right here for this rapping shit
And keep my lyrics accurate
Test me but beating Webby just simply will never happen bitch
Salute me cause truly I be the dopest on the chords
Master Yoda with the bars, I'm a Jedi with the force
That's cause Webby done got that flow
They can act like they don't know
But they ain't fucking with me period yo
Finito[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm rollin' safe and sound, easy as I blaze a pound
Put my middle fingers in the air and never take it down
Writin' raps for me is easy, I just play around
Hit em' with these crazy adverbs and outrageous nouns
And still no labels found me and fuckin' signed me yet
And though I grow impatient, I know my time is next
I'm a big dog, y'all are tiny pets
I'm an autobot, I got it tatted on my chest
Optimus Primes my mothafuckin' bodyguard
So I hit em' with these you can never stop me bars
I'm at the sake bar, gettin' blacked out
Till I wake up on the sidewalk passed out
The judge is tellin' me this is my last chance
So I gotta stay grindin' like a lap dance
Got bitches bendin' over like they had a back cramp
Insert below the lower back tat, damn
I'm why your girlfriend lacks pants
Huh, steady work her out like it's fat camp
Uh, yo, somebody grab a trash can
Shit, at least somewhere to ash man
I gotta dutch lit, rappin' with soul
Leave you with a fat lip like you're packin' some Skoal
Cause I do it for the Franklins
I'm a blue whale and the games full of plankton
I'm a vet, a top threat, known to rock sets
Tear it the fuck down for DJ Booth.net
So yes, I'm ballin' truly so y'all should shoot me
You can see me on that online Call of Duty
Smack booty, I'm rude and intrusive, hardly lucid
Hittin' DJ Booth with that exclusive
I need no excuses, I spit that crack
Play fetch with the disc jockey bring that shit back
They said Asher's the best in the burbs, well at least that's what they said
And that's for one reason, cause they ain't heard Web
I make a mean song, plus I kick it from the head
Always buzzin off the A.D.D. meds, Hempstead!
To CT you know I make the best stutter
No Will Ferrel, but you better step, brother
Ha, that's why your girl's ass bare
I hit it, and didn't pay for the cab fare
Now relax there, don't get pissed off
I'm the survivor on my island, and you been kicked off
Think this kid's soft? R.O.F.L
I got the look, got the swag, and a flow that sells
My reputation so excels so just stop
I do more then watch for sex, drugs, and rock
I'm silly and such, fillin' a dutch
Battlin' dudes who simply suck
Then go fuck Hillary Duff
Tryin to rap it with my dick in the butt
And spit fire, so I'm sorry Lizzie McGuire
See, I'm rappin' past the throttle, I'll crack a bottle
So you better get the fuckin picture like a graphic novel
I got your little bastard boggled
You couldn't fuck with me even if we spittin' at a brothel
Cause I be killin' em like Hostile, murderous with words
That's why they sayin' Webby is the best up in the burbs[Intro]
Yeah, Webby, Freeway, yeah!
Block to the Burbs, man
If you nice, you nice, end of story

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I'm reppin' for the burbs, still I'm murderin' verses
With Connecticut inserted in ink on my epidermis
Written in my skin layer, with rhymin', I've been greater
Writin' lyrics on a piece of paper since a sixth grader
With my CD disc player, playin' loud up in the Sony phones
With a style of the flowin' that I call my own
CT's what I call my home and I'm never leavin' you
Put us on the map is what I need to do
And even through the hate and the criticism I take it and listen
But all you fakers are breakin' the way I rape 'em with lyricism
I stay with the clearest rhythm, regardless of burb spot
Burbs to the blocks if you spittin' a verse hot
And that's all that matters, you either got it or not
Regardless of where you grew up at with your mom and your pops
See, I'm in it to the finish, never plottin' to stop
Rhymin' heat, pilot seat, kamikaze the spot
Think you dope? Well you're probably not
I could body the block with nothin' but a sixteen on the top
I'm like Tony Soprano when I rip it I bust flow in a suburban commando
And I'm bigger than Hulk Hogan
Check it I'm wreckin' every consecutive second
In from Philly back to the 2-03 that's what we representin'
I've been destined to make it, and I won't stop 'til I get it
And now it's Freezer and Webby, two different worlds are connected

[Hook]
(C) Ride to the 'burbs, take a trip with me
We gon' cruise all around the world
(F) Man, they hatin' when we visit, come around they girls
Visit burbs, visit ghettos all around the world
(C) From the burbs to the block take a trip with me
We gon' cruise all around the world
(F) When we visit try to keep us from around your girls
Visit burbs, visit ghettos all around the world

[Verse 2: Freeway]
911 it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From the hood to the burbs, every one of you people heard of Free-
Way, and for y'all that ain't heard of me
House old one in '06, no burglary
Survived the Roc split, continued to drop hits
These rappers continue to bite my shit, commit perjury
Outer space bars, Freezer still spit mercury
Flow is from outta this planet, women from Venus
Men are from whatever planet, they think with they penis
E.T. bars, spacemen look for me when they land it
Never panic, hit up Webby tell him, "Ready to canvas"
Globetrotter, I'm in Africa, be back by the evenin'
Don't sweat it, I will be there on behalf of the Beamer
Plus the Delta Sky team while I insist that I'm reppin'
When I fly that's who I fly with, I'm a diamond member
Any weather, ? I can get up on a jet and jet it?
Back home they call me Chester, cause I get the cheddar
Yeah I get to the green, I got my shit together
It's a national hustler, I still ? rocks in the united states
Still bobblin' mecca, from the burbs to the ghetto
Word to the wise, never lie in your rap songs, learn from Geppetto
Pinnocchio, tell lies and your nose grow
Me and Webby ride, get cheddy 'til we old folks

[Hook]

[Outro]
From the Burbs to the Block
Burbs to the ghetto[Intro:]
Yeah, y'know you think this is all there is to life sometimes
You grind so hard, huh, you forget, but I guess I'm moving onto bluer skies
Right

[Hook:]
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I'm moving on to bluer skies

[Verse 1:]
You see the life I used to live I don't know anymore
I'm a step away from not being broke anymore
I'mma grind so hard I don't even have a life
Used to have fun every night now I just write
In the booth, press record and I let my soul bleed
For these listeners like you, to critique, so you see
It's all I ever wanted, could've sworn that it was true
But sometimes I wonder if I do
Sessions in the studio goin' on till seven in the morning
Got me wondering if it's blue skies or storming
No time to kick it with the homies and all that
I'm sorry, I'm so busy, yo, I meant to call back
The people I grew up with, chilled and smoked blunts with
Now I got it back to the end, trust it
When I see you again, we'll roll up a dub
And go back to the way we was, it's all love

[Hook:]
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I'm moving on to bluer skies

[Verse 2:]
Staying up 'til the sunrise with my mind racing
Thinking to myself is this a dream worth chasing
Lost contact with friends 'cos of the grind
It's not that I don't got love, just no time
Mom and Dad, yo, I can't thank you enough
I know the past months have been rough, thanks for putting up
But your renegade son conduct disorderly
But no matter what I was doing you still supported me
Sorry that I don't call you as much as I should
But your boy is on the grind, non-stop, doing good
(It grooves down to D-Block and Dame Dash felt me)?
I know I'm doing something special, you ain't got to tell me
Following that bright light to fortune and fame
Sacrificing all I got to immortalize my name
Every single day I gotta put up a fight
But this the life that I asked for, right?

[Hook:]
I'm moving on, I'm moving on
I'm moving on to bluer skies

[Outro:]
Keeping moving on
Gotta keep on moving on[Intro: Chris Webby & Anna Yvette]
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
Webby
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
Worked hard for this shit man
There's nothing but blue skies ahead right?
Huh
(Nothing but blue skies)

[Hook: Anna Yvette]
Down came the rain, to wash away the pain again
[?}
When I open my eyes, now there's nothing but blue skies
Down came the rain, to wash away the pain again
[?}
When I open my eyes, now there's nothing but blue skies

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
See I've been walking on this thin line
Trying to keep my mood right
Persevere through stormy weather
Cloudy in the moonlight
Sleepless for a few nights
Always kept my crew tight
Empty on the fuel light
Made it here on fumes
I been waiting on a sunny day
Sat there and I fucking pray
Went through ups and downs but knew I'd rise to fight another day
Gained a lot of battle scars
Held my ground like  Jaguar Paw
Charging at these matadors
Ain't stopping until I have it all
This game I'm in will steal your soul quicker than Shang Tsung
And change you some, but I won't forget where I came from
For all the kids living in middle-class America
Somebody needs to be the voice for us so I'm preparin' ya
Put it all on the line for the generation that I'm a-fucking-part of
With the heart of a lion out on the grind
Bitch, I came up being hated
Skill level always debated
Now I'm watching all the faces of the critics as I make it (Yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's been a struggle since you all have seen it firsthand
Deep into my work plan
Trying to make it work man
Reppin' for New England
Stompin' through the quick sand
Homie check my wing span
I will never hit land
So high in the atmosphere I'm looking down on planes
Got the blood of a champion in my veins
Motherfucker I've been stuck in the underground like the roots of a plant
And people doubted every move until I proved that I can
Shit, I command a fucking legion of my fans behind me
Labels scared to take a chance because they can't define me
Anybody steppin' better back off now (Step Off)
Make 'em hit the ground
Got 'em yelling "Black Hawk Down" (Huh)
My main concern is that it will always be the music
While these other so called rappers more concerned about their shoes
It's like a fight against the current
Fuck it, I'll do right
Grinding until I'm lookin up in
(Nothing but blue skies)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's rise against the tide
Let's take a fuckin' stand
For all the non-believers show 'em that we fuckin' can
Competition ducked and ran
Fearin' their disruption
Cause whenever I was down I brushed it off and got back up
So whenever they try to tell you, that you won't amount to nothin'
Let it fuel the fuckin' fire and your soul will keep on comin'
Persistent till you get it
Push your body to the limit
Cause shit when you get your moment you best be ready to live it (huh)
So now it's bluer skies
And livin' super size
And shit can change in a second
This game is do or die
All I  can do is try
Never fearin' failure
Always keep it real that's why they feelin' it like Braille words
It's time to take my turn
And risk it all now
And I ain't got no safety net so if I fall now
This shit will kill me
So welcome to my true life
On the Edge Lookin up at
(Nothing But Blue Skies
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

[Hook][Freestyle]
It’s Chris Webby, getting high as fuck right now
I’m hella sick, and no one knows what I’m infected with
So hi it’s nice to meet you
I’m the guy your girl been texting with
Evil rap nemesis, lighting up that heady shit
That’s potent as the poison in a fucking box jellyfish
In a box Chevy with the soldiers in my fellowship
Legolas and Aragorn cruising through Connecticut
Leave behind a trail of empty bottles and jealous chicks
Throw around bread, I’m on my Hansel and Gretel shit
A psychopath on a path of destruction
Popping Xanax til I’m seeing black
I better pass the Dutch Master I’m puffing
The first up the the mic but the last to the function
Stumbling drunk with a busty chick with a passion for sucking
East Coast, we don’t borrow your swagger for nothing
We’d rather start a battle instead of having a discussion
So pass it back to me, cousin
Shit I’m so nice I could spit this shit right here backwards in Russian!

No sound like the one I got
They can hear it anytime I rock
Cause all I got’s my balls and my word
And this baggie full of herb
And I’m coming for that #1 spot

I’ve always been a loose cannon
They say I rolled off of a pirate ship
High as shit, Bobby Costas, look how red my eyes’ll get
I’m out in Sochi, 720 to a flying split
And land all up in that vagina bitch, huh
See I be showing them what I can do with this shit
Yo what you think I was new to this shit?
Got a beautiful chick in the passenger seat
Giving head to me while I maneuver the whip
Vroom, rhyme book staying fucking full
Chemically Imbalanced, and fully fucking disfunctional[Intro]
When it feels like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down, woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound

[Verse 1: D-Loc]
Zippity zippity bappity bap
Zip zip zoom, bap bap boom
Rippity rack, clickity clack
Put one in the hole I'm ready to rap
This how we do when the Kings in the building
That's how we do when the caps start peeling
That's how we do when the barrel goes bam
That's how we do when I'm smoking on my gram yeah
Tell me what you motherfuckers really wanna do
Wanna run around the track while I run around it too
Wanna run run, get that, split that
Run run run let me hit that, rip that
Hit that, rip that, get that, go
Let me put it in the pipe, let me back it in the bowl
Let me run run run run run run
Like motorbike racer running this show

[Verse 2: Johnny Richter]
I never really get upset all the way to the point
Where I feel like there's no holding back now
Try to get a good outlet, try to reroute
All the things that are weighing me down now
All it seems I need is a big bag of weed
And a couple shots of lets say Crown
A few dope beats and I’m taking a Jeep
To a mountain top out of town
That's where I go when I gotta get out so
I don’t blow my top off and explode
Cause when I lose control there's not enough time
For me to come back one piece, body whole
I know you know or at least I know you relate
Cause I've heard so many stories told
Gotta take a leap of faith
Put your song on your headphones
And know that your not alone

[Hook]
When it feels like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down, woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound
When the people with the hands and feet dance
Start spinning around (zoom zoom zoom)
Everybody it's time to party
With that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound

[Bridge]
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all day
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom away
Listen to the sounds of the KMK

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Web hit em with that boom clap sound
Weed in the bubbler, turn back round
Higher than the Martians when I'm sparkin'
With a needle I'm Shontelle, just touched down now
Every dude stay rocking out
All the potheads from the college dropping out
Stay rapping truth, need apple juice
Cause everybody on the track got Kottonmouth
We rock those speakers, drop that ether
Boom clap hit em with that onomatopoeia
Breaking the chronic like the continents that made up Pangaea
A son of anarchy, constantly copping cannabis
A medical grade from a dispensary in Los Angeles
Can't handle this, amateurs get devoured in my sandwiches
I eat MCs for breakfast lunch and dinner, got no manners kid
Wayne and Garth in the building
I'm here to get my party on, and get my Marley on
Cause we burning like Rastafarians
Everyday is Mardi Gras, so bitch show me your titties now
Pass the piff around till we finish the whole fricken pound
Kottonmouth and Webster dropping it professional
So lifted off the ground that they think we're extraterrestrials

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Boom clap, boom clap, sound of the Po
Sound of the Po, sound of the Po
I don’t know 'bout to lose control
Here they go, whoop whoop
Boom clap, boom clap, sound of the Po
Sound of the Po, sound of the Po
I don’t know 'bout to lose control
Here they go, weoh weoh

[Verse 4: The Dirtball]
Hear that, that be the sound of the police, on their way
To ruin your time woah! Everybody in the area
Spark it up so they lose their mind
Boom clap fo shizzy, I’m gonna keep these raps busy
I’m gonna keep my brain all dizzy
Better get a map when you get a boom clizzy
Clap clap when you hear my gun go BLAP BLAP
That be the level of the party
And bring it so give me the bubble, and snap snap yeah
Now let it all go, we'll move to the beat
Keep giving me the bass, an feeling the street
In front of the crowd, an boiling in the heat
And never stop, and never decease, I’m off the leash
So give me the keys, you've got to believe me
Open your eyes so now you can see me
Over the lies, I’m over the dreamy
Keep looking around, I’m banging the ground
Forever I’m peeling, just give me the track
I’m eating your guts and stealing
Similar times resemble the grizzly feeding
Resembling what I’m achieving
Related to rap, and call me a heeven
Fuck everybody, I’m ending up leaving
The party is over, disgust it ain't stopping
Reserve it for good but now it ain't popping
An now that I see your true colors I think I'll be dropping
Outta the race to keep it from floppin'
Keepin' the party alive, the only one option
The only one option is what

[Hook]
