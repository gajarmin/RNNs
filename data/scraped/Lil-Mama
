[Intro]
Everybody get up
Good morning to you
The birds are chirping
I don't f--- with you

[Hook]
Eggs, bacon, grits
You better use a condom if you taking that
All these broke niggas that be on my
Need to hop off

[Verse 1]
Look, mama's in the kitchen, yup ya damn right
Ty got the grillz and they flooded with the ice
I just checked the mail, my sister going to Yale
Man she probably got a man, but she don't kiss and tell
Rockin' Robin's jeans and my walk is mean
Young queen when I step on the scene I whip cream
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Money, money, taught her how to whip it now she remixin' for low
Hey, you, get off my style
You don't know me, and you don't know my pals
I pow pow like a comic (comic)
Dr. Robotnik like Sonic (Sonic)
Ill with the flow and it only gets better
Save your breath if it ain't about cheddar
It's funny how I asked ya'll years ago
Watcha know about me and you still don't know


[Hook]
Eggs, bacon, grits (sausage)
You better use a condom if you taking that (sausage)
All these broke niggas that be on my (sausage)
Need to hop off (my sausage)
My sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa (sausage)
My sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa (sausage)
Eggs, bacon, grits (sausage)
Hop off (my sausage)

[Verse 2]
We eatin', that Oscar Mayer bacon
I don't eat pork so As-Salamu Alaykum
Turkey, bacon, breakfast in the makin'
Off the rip, I whine like I'm Jamaican
My milkshake brings the boys to the basement
Backyard's grillin' feel like a vacation
My whole style straight wild, no patience
Check out my hair, Peruvian, Malaysian
I cut it off in the summer when its blazin'
I cut you off if you fake and you hatin'
I know they can't take all this money I'm makin'
But call me Betty Crocker, though, cause I'm cakin'
Booty shakin' from the left to the right
Bigger belt too tight so my back is achin'
To the left, to the right
Tell me what's shakin' fore I bring the break in

[Break]
Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, you played your games
Wednesday, you ran away
Thursday, you were so hurt
Thursday to Friday, you came back
You wanted to, leave school
On Saturday, but that ain’t how I give it up
(So what you gonna do)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Whet, look at the flick of da wrist
Whet, look at the flick of da, whet, whet
Look at da flick of the bish
Whet, (Punani get serious)
Yo, look at the flick of da wrist
Look at these hips, look at the way that they switch
Look at the way that I flip, look at the pit
Look how I'm stackin' these chips
Just look at what I got on, I am too slick
Look at the beat that I'm on
Look at the way that they hate, look at the greats
Look at me, look at Lebron
Yo, I said in case you ain't know now you know its a go
Charms on my arms like my pops got the blow
I lean on the mic like a smooth criminal
On the cover of Vogue now watch me cover this Vogue

[Bridge]
Vogue, Vogue
Mizrahi
Vogue, Vogue
Mizrahi
Vogue, Vogue
Mizrahi
On the cover of Vogue now watch me cover this Vogue
All in, all in

Any block, milly rock
I milly rock on any block
Any block, milly rock
I milly rock on any block
We wasn’t invited but we all

[Outro]
If you see me walkin' down the street
And I start to cry, walk on by
Walk on by, foolish pride
That's all that I have left so let me hide
All the pain and the hurt that you gave me, when you said goodbye
Walk on[Intro: Lil' Mama]
Chea! Uh huh
[It's poppin! (it's poppin) It's poppin! (It's poppin)]
Yeah...okay...

I dunno...Let's go!

[Hook]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin
I'm standin at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin, my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin, they chase me after school

[Lil' Mama]
Mac (mac) L'Oreal, yep cause *I'm worth it*
Love the way, I puts it on so perfect
Wipe, the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway they cain't say nothin
Oh!, Oh! Oh! My lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes
L'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crussssshESS...

[Hook]

[Lil' Mama]
When it's, time for lunch, my lips still rock
Lil' Mama melon with da hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virture
Dey, lovin! Lip gloss universal
The boys really like it, the girls don't speak
They - rollin they eyes, they lip gloss cheap
It ain't MY fault, but I could +up-graaade ya+
Show you how to use nice things with nice flaaaavas

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
Cuz myyyyy lip glooooooooss - is poppin! (is poppin)
Is poppin! (Is poppin)
Cuz myyyyy lip glooooooooss - is poppin! (is poppin)
Is poppin! (Is poppin)

[Lil' Mama]
Sittin in eighth period, thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like "Yes Ms. McClarkson?"
She like, "Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss and -
Write down where you get yours from
Cuz I must admit, that bubblegum
Is poppin! (is poppin)
Is poppin!" She ain't frontin..
[Lil' Mama croons]
N-uh, I be lovin it, I be I be lovin it n-uh
I be usin it, I be I be usin it n-uh
I be rubbin it, I be I be rubbin it
On my lips, my lips (ah) my lip gloss

[Hook][Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Your boy got it popping like Crisco
Number one independent on the east coast
I rep the streets, I don't do it for the weirdos
I am really with the [?] yo
I been having women and gold around my neck
I'm a hustler, what the fuck do you expect?
Roll with the lex, ride Benz don't roll with the Lex
But y'all push 700's they ain't mold to you yet
Been getting bread so long, is there mold on it yet?
Something like a pimp no ring on my pinky
Full in fur, coming through all minky
Big cuban chains coming through all linky
Shitting on haters, leave you all stinky
Phew!
Said I would leave you blue
Get it, men do what they say
Troy Ave did it
I brought New York back like Earl the Pearl
Now BSB records 'bout to conquer the world

[Verse 2: Detroit Che]
Yo, yo, yo
Last year I was watching it from the couch
I stayed in tune with all my dreams
Haters see me living them out
I'm from Detroit, Michigan, homie, it's the home of the Lions
My homies was dying, rock hoodies during moments of silence
Passionate, practicing activists doper than [?] put a cap in this
Renisha's shooter switched it and said he did it on accident
Rest in peace to Mcbride and Mike brown and Trayvon
They days gone and they was so young and it touched me
Like an iPod but I won't cry
Government they gave us nothing and they say that we don't try
We get robbed like corner stores for justice and I'm so tired
I'm super tired like carrying ten Mariahs
Put tires around my neck I'm finna start a riot (let's go)
This the book of hip hop [?] illustrate
Don't compare me to Nicki, my titties been deflated
And that wasn't a diss, I swear I look up to that chick
But critics be talking regardless putting these bloggers in coffins
Queen Che

[Verse 3: Dee-1]
Just holla at me if you need that real
And if it's true that words are weapons, Dee packs steel
I did it solo, no aid
But Dee's that ill, I [?]
And thieves that kill can't steal that skill for real
I'm a positive black man, beware in the streets
Don't compare me unless it's to the man America leads
Sit back an reteach [?]
Unashamed coming for they neck, watch your clavicle
They say "Dee, who was your cosign?", mine was God
My watch made out of concrete, times was hard
You's a mental slave dog, why you robbing and stealing
Money don't buy happiness, ask Robin Williams
I'm in the building, I'm probably on that pelligrino
Dolphin that rhymes on my feet, I think I'm Dan Marino
It's Uno, cut the deck, you know he won
Cause New Orleans watching this saying "Go Dee-1!" (yeah)

[Verse 4: Logic]
Allow me to murder this
For anybody that may not have heard of this
It's the L-O-G-I-C I'm repping MD yes y'all know the deal
We keep it real all the time, V's up, that's on my mind
I'm feeling infinite, like Eminem's first album
Speak to the people like Malcolm
Murder your mind in a minute, like the Millenium Falcon
Rip the mic and yeah I know the outcome
Check it, I'm biracial, but couldn't tell by the facial
So everybody swears that his parents wasn't interracial
But if I had dreads, sold drugs and screamed "Fuck the feds!"
Then maybe, just maybe they might give me some street cred
Even though I grew up with that all in my house
Ain't gotta glorify that shit, there's more to talk about, but
Don't get it twisted, I'm far from a mad rapper
If anything I'm the finest of dead president kidnappers
I got so much on my mind but not enough time to mention
Cause I'm ripping and living and striving and killing [?] going and flowing
I'm only spitting this fast cause that's how y'all gonna pay attention
Cause we on TV
See they don't care about what I'm saying, just how I'm saying it
So I gotta spit it fast and make sure that there's no delaying
Yeah, well, but if you're one of the few that want the real and not the lesser
Go to iTunes and cop that Logic album "Under Pressure"
Yeah

[Verse 5: Lil' Mama]
I said don't ask me about no broads, no rap wars
I do this for my Mike Brown brothers that's really at war
Therefore, y'all better close y'alls jaws
When it come to me, cause y'all gonna need wraps and gauze
I'm the underdog, clear, y'all ain't gotta like me
Gather your best armor bodying me less than likely
I swear on James Brown if you try me
Red Hook Summer like Spike Lee
Bloody gloves, we in the ring like carats
This ain't the first quarter, but I'm balling like it's March Madness
Heh? I got 'em pinched cause I'm lavish
When you're in a motel you better hold your bladder
Now what they talking about this MC deficit?
Like I will run up on that stigma put a death to it
Man, realize that I'm the best at this
And I don't gotta wear a dress to be addressing this{Greatness plus greatness, equals great greatness}

[Lil' Mama - Intro]
Hey...hey...hey...
The way we get loose, we move our shoul-ders
For-ward, heads back
Get it in Control like Janet Jack
Get it on the flo', let 'em know what's happenin

L-I-L, you better ask somebody
I been on my grind since butt touch potty
Y'all don't really want it with the young hot toddler
Wit a flo' so spec like techno-lotta
It's, so sick, how the clock go tick
Keep givin y'all hits like techmatic
UH! It's the reason why I spit it how I spit it
When I spit, it's like mucus - gotta get rid of it
These chicks don't pop like me
Uncompatable girl, no comparin me
AND, ain't none of y'all scarin me
Like "Don't Cha" wish ya girl was as bad as me - YEAH
Wit a flow so sick like Twista's
So sweet, but could be cold like a mystic
Instincts come so smooth like what is it?
BK, H-dub ours like a wizard

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Hook]

[Lil' Mama - repeat 2X]
In the crib, in the club, in the block, it don't matter
It-it don't, it-it-it, it don't matter

In the crib, in the club, in the block, it don't matter
I spit stats - 4, 5, 6, I do da-data
How she do, di-di-di-dat like dat?
Got the hood on the back and her pockets is fat
Still rollin, rollin -left (left) right (right)
Shot callin, callin - that's (that's) right (right)
Cause my team on the market, famila we 'bout to pop it
Lock, drop and roll like a hip-hop rock show
You never know where my mind gon' go
N-n-NOT Puerto Rican but I like mangoes
So smooth on the danceflo' (So prove on the dance flo')
When you see me comin I'm runnin it like a game show
You ain't know, Lil' Mama go
She be runnin and poppin it, hit you wit the bust flow
She's haaaAAHHHHH-OOOOOOAWT!
So get loose on the flo' and I cannot stop

[Hook][Hook: Lil' Mama]

L is for the liars that have surrounded me
I insecurities my head down in these streets
F, my future there isn't one
E Eternal hope
And this is my life

[Verse: Lil' Mama]

I wake up every day to the same old foster mother
I ain't got no pictures of my mother
She was a crack fiend nothing like Pac mother
She didn't make a difference even though she could've
Mama I'm ashamed
Ashamed of my life
Pappa probly sold me twice
On a late night stopped by
And look in my eyes
Bags from the tears that I've cried
And the people who lied
Telling me that this is my place
Phony tried to smile In my face
But I should have known something
Was weird
Smiled when she opened the mail
Kept a nice mink on her back
Meanwhile I got a goose & my pockets got patches
I'm so mad this is me
I'm so hurt this is me
So why should it be
But I'm a be alright though

[Hook: Lil' Mama]

[Verse: Lil' Mama]

I'm pregnant by a dude & he not 16
But I like his style & his whip is mean
My mama told me to find a man to take care Of me & he does buy me things but he beats on me
I go to her for a little advice
So I show up with a black eye
Telling me to know my place so I stay
Waiting for my body phase
Telling myself it's just a little pregnancy phase
When all in reality I'm being discourage & disrespected
And under the pressure
And I don't really blame the man
I blame my mother for not teaching me the different types of man
Life never understood or stand my side of story being that it's so consist
18 years And 9 months developing raised in a prison I guess I'll never make a difference

[Hook: Lil' Mama]

[Verse: Lil' Mama]

Born akward with nothing to offer's the least
Of my problems
Appearance like deja vu
Stomach is starving
Free lunch, breakfast, eat eventially I departed
So ashamed of a life that was started
I asked God if he can take the pain away
He made me in denial of every word I pray, every day
It's the same old no talents
I'm feeling like my life is unbalanced no telling what tomorrow gon look like
Yea right wrapped up in a fast life for a sudicial act
Why is my life set up for a failure I can care less what the people say to ya'll
We break out in rage venting all the hurt inside
Who am I to tell you what you fail to realize the voice that you hold Within you
The voice that you are
The Voice Of The Young People!

[Hook: Lil' Mama][Intro]
Lil Mama and Avril Lavigne REMIX

[Verse 1]
Don't get it twisted Lil Mama got my paper on
That means I'm a paper chaser I chase my paper on
And I know we chasing paper that you be chasing on

In the summer time blazing you wanna be my boyfriend

[Chorus][x2]

Oh in a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
Cause I can, cause I can do it better

So when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid what the hell were you thinking?

[Verse 4]
You wave goodbye
Your girls a bird
You're by my side

You and her that sounds absurd

[Chorus][x2]

Oh baby! That's when it's rock-a-bye baby!

[Hook]

[Lil' Mama]
Why don't you come around here, dawg?

Like I will run up on that stigma put a death to it
Man, realize that I'm the best at this
And I don't gotta wear a dress to be addressing this[Lil Mama]
When you hear Left Eye
When you hear Lil' Mama (Shake it down now)
You know it's time to get busy
So it ain't really much too talk about
How was it working with her?
It was an honor

[Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes]
Remember way back in the day (hey hey)
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus
Had you bumpin' on down the street
Tryin' to move your feet
While you shake your little booty
To the groove of the beat (uh)
To the beat
To the beat (beat)
You hit the corner and you stopped
Hey y'all there's a party on the other block
We hit the jackpot
Jackpot (what what)
And it's only 12 o'clock
And the sun is hot
Free soda pop
We about to rock rock rock rock...

Everybody come on

Now that I think about it
I was always takin away from my father
Or he was always takin away from me
It's probably why we so close now
Ya know?

[Hook: Yirayah]

We been starvin so long in these crazy ghetto streets
And they say we're so wrong for the way we try to eat
How long will we struggle
I gotta grind jus to eat now
I gotta eat just to live now
So I gotta live my life this way

[Verse: Lil'Mama]

I stretched and yawned
4 years from a newborn
On a charter bus
Filled with stranged humans
Besides my mother nobody seems anxious
Though we on our way to visit a college campus
We roll up freshen up at a food concession
Can't talk to strangers
I wanna ask 'em questions
Saw a woman cryin'
Boy face to fist
I don't wanna go to college
If it causes this
Back on the bus still analyzin vibes
Turned to my moms excel asked her why you cryin?
She said because I'm happy
But I could tell she lyin'
And since lyin was a curse
I sense storytelling
Her eyes focused on a object long enough they tingle
That's when she reached into her bag because her phone was ringin'
She said "I accept"
I'm still puzzle piecing
I knew my pops was on the other line
Lonely singin'

[Hook: Yirayah]

[Verse: Lil'Mama]

Soon after we roll up to these gates
Barbed wired up
Men standing in the entrance armed up
With a close eye on us
We enter the buildin
Got checked by the women who staring
My mother
Pull out a card with a picture of her face on it
Two papers with our names on it
They identify her
They lookin at me
Me my confusion of the journey
Thorugh these walls we go
Before the next one opens
The past one must close
As they check for proper clothes
My mama so prepared
For this mini-battle has chose
Finally we reach our final destination
My poppa placed in a seat facing me
No women in his class
Just men who never laugh
And when they see they family
They sing
They sing

[Hook: Yirayah]

[Verse: Lil'Mama]

So I begin my investigation
My elbow on the round table
My palm at chin
I'm lookin at him
Asked questions like, "how you been?"
"When you graduating?"
Time was up got pulled away
Kickin' and screamin' (I don't wanna leave)
Tears came to his eyes, but never fell in front me
Got old enough to realize they must've fell up under me
Being locked away in prison from your family
Tryin' to find ways for us to eat
I sing

[Hook: Lil' Mama & Yirayah][Intro: Lil Mama's Sister and Lil Mama]
If my sister tour bus, ride through your town
You're gonna have a problem, tell um Lil' Mama !

Uh uh, no way, you can show me how [x2]
Uh uh, no way, you can show me how

[Verse 1 : Lil Mama]
When I bump up on the track it's like
(Whoomp, there it is)
From the block parties to house parties
I gets it in
I'ma bump my Bee's and knees
And that's exactly what I meant
Young beast from the East
So you know I puts it in
I'm that ghetto gorgeous gangster girl
With the fly G slide international (is wretch you know)
By the way that I bounce on the track (you know)
You ain't never see a girl like this (oh no)
My whole team fly high
We ride 'till we die
Run into dudes who be
Yapping and always trying to get by
But I don't hear
It goes in one ear and out the other
Taught him how to G-slide and he taught his mother
Get get down big Mama'
I can dig it that you got it
But when my block starts the G
A stampede startin'

[Hook]

[Kadar]
Lil' Mama get it poppin' puttin' work (I put it work) [x3]
Lil' Mama get it poppin' puttin' work (Hey!)

[Verse 2 : Kadar]
New shirt (New shirt)
New kicks (New kicks)
New ants

No auto maw
We live in the new times
Lil' ma must've artist for me
Is the new grime
More money, more money

She the princess of the city
I'm her son boy shine
Top the dime
Shorty got cake like uh
Duncan Hines, come on G-slide

[Lil Mama]
They be callin' me T in the hood cause I bring the Pain daddy
And when the time is going down
Make you ring daddy
That mean you got to feel me
Cause I'm might make you fly
And if you G-slide slow
You better pick it up

Be shy do it
See shorty lookin' over from the side viewin'
I'm 'bout to hook him up
And show him how to do it
Slide right, slide left
Hit time

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Lil Mama]
Lil' mama get it popping
Stand on the streets so the people yell
Just lookin' at me like
No fair, I'm here, no fair
And my heart gonna nip you girls
I bet you gonna live no losses
I switch verses like sauces
That prego sauce be poppin
She so hot
When I go bring them down to popping
Now you tip and try to touch
May end up with red spots
When it's hot, then it's hot
If it ain't, then it's not
No wait, you walk over
There's no room up on the spot
Cause I spot little creatures trying to turn beast (turn beast)
Go feast
They better turn because I'm red meat (meat)
And it's wait wait to see me
While I do it for the TV
In the hood
In the hood
Is probably where I must be (be, be, be...)

[Hook][Hook: Lil' Mama]

L is for the liars that have surrounded me
I insecurities my head down in these streets
F, my future there isn't one
E Eternal hope
And this is my life

[Verse: Lil' Mama]

I wake up every day to the same old foster mother
I ain't got no pictures of my mother
She was a crack fiend nothing like Pac mother
She didn't make a difference even though she could've
Mama I'm ashamed
Ashamed of my life
Pappa probly sold me twice
On a late night stopped by
And look in my eyes
Bags from the tears that I've cried
And the people who lied
Telling me that this is my place
Phony tried to smile In my face
But I should have known something
Was weird
Smiled when she opened the mail
Kept a nice mink on her back
Meanwhile I got a goose & my pockets got patches
I'm so mad this is me
I'm so hurt this is me
So why should it be
But I'm a be alright though

[Hook: Lil' Mama]

[Verse: Lil' Mama]

I'm pregnant by a dude & he not 16
But I like his style & his whip is mean
My mama told me to find a man to take care Of me & he does buy me things but he beats on me
I go to her for a little advice
So I show up with a black eye
Telling me to know my place so I stay
Waiting for my body phase
Telling myself it's just a little pregnancy phase
When all in reality I'm being discourage & disrespected
And under the pressure
And I don't really blame the man
I blame my mother for not teaching me the different types of man
Life never understood or stand my side of story being that it's so consist
18 years And 9 months developing raised in a prison I guess I'll never make a difference

[Hook: Lil' Mama]

[Verse: Lil' Mama]

Born akward with nothing to offer's the least
Of my problems
Appearance like deja vu
Stomach is starving
Free lunch, breakfast, eat eventially I departed
So ashamed of a life that was started
I asked God if he can take the pain away
He made me in denial of every word I pray, every day
It's the same old no talents
I'm feeling like my life is unbalanced no telling what tomorrow gon look like
Yea right wrapped up in a fast life for a sudicial act
Why is my life set up for a failure I can care less what the people say to ya'll
We break out in rage venting all the hurt inside
Who am I to tell you what you fail to realize the voice that you hold Within you
The voice that you are
The Voice Of The Young People!

[Hook: Lil' Mama][Intro: Lil' Mama]
Chea! Uh huh
[It's poppin! (it's poppin) It's poppin! (It's poppin)]

All the boys keep jockin, they chase me after school

[Lil' Mama]
Mac (mac) L'Oreal, yep cause *I'm worth it*
Love the way, I puts it on so perfect
Wipe, the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway they cain't say nothin
Oh!, Oh! Oh! My lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes
L'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crussssshESS...

[Hook]

[Lil' Mama]
When it's, time for lunch, my lips still rock
Lil' Mama melon with da hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virture

Show you how to use nice things with nice flaaaavas

[Hook]

I stepped in her office like "Yes Ms. McClarkson?"
She like, "Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss and -

All these broke niggas that be on my
Need to hop off

[Verse 1]
Look, mama's in the kitchen, yup ya damn right
Ty got the grillz and they flooded with the ice
I just checked the mail, my sister going to Yale
Man she probably got a man, but she don't kiss and tell
Rockin' Robin's jeans and my walk is mean
Young queen when I step on the scene I whip cream
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Money, money, taught her how to whip it now she remixin' for low
Hey, you, get off my style
You don't know me, and you don't know my pals
I pow pow like a comic (comic)
Dr. Robotnik like Sonic (Sonic)
Ill with the flow and it only gets better
Save your breath if it ain't about cheddar
It's funny how I asked ya'll years ago
Watcha know about me and you still don't know


[Hook]
Eggs, bacon, grits (sausage)
You better use a condom if you taking that (sausage)
All these broke niggas that be on my (sausage)

Eggs, bacon, grits (sausage)
Hop off (my sausage)

[Verse 2]
We eatin', that Oscar Mayer bacon
I don't eat pork so As-Salamu Alaykum
Turkey, bacon, breakfast in the makin'
Off the rip, I whine like I'm Jamaican
My milkshake brings the boys to the basement
Backyard's grillin' feel like a vacation
My whole style straight wild, no patience
Check out my hair, Peruvian, Malaysian
I cut it off in the summer when its blazin'
I cut you off if you fake and you hatin'
I know they can't take all this money I'm makin'
But call me Betty Crocker, though, cause I'm cakin'
Booty shakin' from the left to the right
Bigger belt too tight so my back is achin'
To the left, to the right
Tell me what's shakin' fore I bring the break in

[Break]
Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, you played your games
Wednesday, you ran away
Thursday, you were so hurt
Thursday to Friday, you came back
You wanted to, leave school
On Saturday, but that ain’t how I give it up
(So what you gonna do)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Whet, look at the flick of da wrist
Whet, look at the flick of da, whet, whet
Look at da flick of the bish
Whet, (Punani get serious)
Yo, look at the flick of da wrist
Look at these hips, look at the way that they switch
Look at the way that I flip, look at the pit
Look how I'm stackin' these chips
Just look at what I got on, I am too slick
Look at the beat that I'm on
Look at the way that they hate, look at the greats
Look at me, look at Lebron
Yo, I said in case you ain't know now you know its a go
Charms on my arms like my pops got the blow
I lean on the mic like a smooth criminal
On the cover of Vogue now watch me cover this Vogue

[Bridge]

We wasn’t invited but we all

[Outro]
If you see me walkin' down the street
And I start to cry, walk on by
Walk on by, foolish pride
That's all that I have left so let me hide
All the pain and the hurt that you gave me, when you said goodbye
Walk on{Greatness plus greatness, equals great greatness}

[Lil' Mama - Intro]
Hey...hey...hey...

Born star like my lil' brother ?Onstar?
And I will, eat you rappers plus the candy's inside

I'mma truth in the booth, +Shawty Gets Loose+
And they way I eat guys so mean
"Lil' Mama, YOU'RE SO MEAN!" - SO?!

When you START tryin to play with my brain like I'm crazy
Oh baby! That's when it's rock-a-bye baby!

[Hook]

[Lil' Mama]
Why don't you come around here, dawg?
Look for me, type ease in bees we breeze
Pass your team, cause I been to where you sightseen
Nothing that you do or could ever do to excite me
Can't see, like we know maybes or more than likely
She gon' have flow {?}, which means I got flow sick disease
Which means I have no sympathies, no antedote, y'all heard of me!
Please, wit these CB-4 chicks

This is what I been sayin for some time now (time now)
If anybody got an object-ion, time's now!
Mo' fitted and mo' stroll cause she's ON
She's on - (wha?) SHE'S ON!
Wake up in the mornin, go to sleep at dawn
My mama shoulda named me Dawn, ah-uh-uh, ONNN!!
Either way, I woulda been a trip, the way I flip {YEAH!}
The script and switch then get down like this - I'm WHAT IT ISSS!

[Hook]

["I'm what it is" ad-libs and chants continues 'til the end of the song][Intro:]
Uh uh, baby baby
Uh uh, baby

[Verse 1:]
You're the mission up in this option
I ain't walking round here topless
(Baby, baby)

I know them girls be getting it popping
Strange way of getting it popping
(Baby, baby)

And if you can't see it through these jeans
Then you won't see it up on me
(Baby, baby)

It's best to tell you don't waste your time
Your eyes don't make me fine
(Baby, baby)

[Chorus:]
I ain't heard that G.A.M.E
You give you my love
If you can't see that
I ain't giving you whatever you want, boy

I ain't another toy in ya toybox for me
It's my love
And my love ain't free
It's your mama's fault
That you can't see that

It's all good
Pick up your fate, boy
It's all good
Pick up your fate, boy
All my girlz like
(Uh uh, baby baby, uh uh, baby baby)

[Verse 2:]
A good boy
Stop the promising
Ever since good boys ain't so common
And good sense ain't so common

Go head
Make stupid look real funny then
Tomorrow might be every word in the hook
So call me every word in the book (baby, baby)

It's best to tell you
Don't waste your time
Your eyes don't make me fine

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

[Lil Mama:]
Karina, when he thinks he a pimp
What you tell 'em?

[Karina:]
See you call it pimping
But I call it slipping

[Lil Mama:]
Cause we don't get down like that (no)

[Karina:]
I'ma say what I say
With or without your attention
(Uh, uh, baby, uh, uh, baby)

[Lil Mama:]
I been up this block so long
Like old timers
Thought he stand for good cause like Obama

Through my girls
Some smart, some dumber
The smart was [?]
[?]
(Baby, baby)

The hotter it got
The more they took off
And the hotter I got
The more I took off

Fly like an eagle
Tell the boy I don't need 'em
Karina, mama leader
The voice of the young people

[Repeat Chorus:][Intro]
You feel me?

[Chorus]
In the mirror, I'm looking at the shadow
If I bash her, I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep falling from my heart

In the mirror, I'm looking at the shadow
If I bash her, I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my mind
Broken pieces keep falling from my heart

Cause I know what I'm feeling
And I know what is real
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep falling from my heart

[Verse 1]
Everyday when I wake up, I wanna see your face and I
Realize that you will never apologise
For your lies and all the ways you hurt me
And I know in my mind that you ain't worthy
But when I look in the mirror
I see this girl who keeps crying, she's crying
She's still inlove with you
But I tell her not to cause she's a wilding, she's wilding
I don't know what she's thinkin about
Get it together or I'm kicking you out (of the mirror)
I'm getting you out of my system
My vision premonition (of the mirror)
And I listen to my answers and free my soul from prison

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My patience a plastic bag and he kept filling it
Carrying baggage of others is where I emptied it
Play the fool before, I'm not about to let you enter
My mind for my heart draws the bigger picture
His presence embrace me
His loving so greatly
I miss the way we
Used to sit up all night and talk about nothing, on the phone
Please, how could you get so weak
When you know you deserve so much better
And rather than settle for less
Just let the best play catch up
When the time's right they'll find you
If you choose to do not do
The best I could do is warn and inform you
The mirror

Don't get it twisted Lil Mama got my paper on
That means I'm a paper chaser I chase my paper on
And I know we chasing paper that you be chasing on
