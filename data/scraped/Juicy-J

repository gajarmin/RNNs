[Intro: Juicy J]
The hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
It come true

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do)
Gettin' money is (what I do)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I remember all the nights on different corners spittin' pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sisters daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines, 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do)
Gettin' money is (what I do)

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck bout how you feel

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do)
Gettin' money is (what I do)

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Gotta group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store I drop bands, the Gucci store I drop bands
Prada store I went ham, my left wrist it cost a lamb
Your girlfriend a groupie like Trident she wanna chew me
Hell naw I ain't cuffin' 'em I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor gang, blowin' money, 50,000 on wrist watches
100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

[Hook: Juicy J]
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (what I do) I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (what I do)
Gettin' money is (what I do)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Get money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

[Outro]
Gettin' money is (what I do)[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I just wanna shoot a movie with a chick from out the movies
With a big old ghetto booty that know how to roll a doobie
I just wanna hit the club, throw some money on the stage
I just wanna tip a stripper more dough than she ever made
More dough than she ever seen, now she see me in her dreams
All that ass, shawty bust it, how she stuff it in her jeans
Must run in her genes, I just wanna meet her momma
I just wanna smoke my presidential Juicy J Obama
Juicy J that OG, I been ballin' this whole week
Stuntin' 20 years plus, I can do this in my sleep
I just wanna fall in Onyx with a fine Georgia peach
Got that rocket in my pocket, that's that beauty and the beast

[Hook]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay

[Verse 2: Drake]
Legendary, love you so much it's unnecessary
Like it's always two weeks into February
You can take that shit to the cemetery, til we're dead and buried
But girl God forbid I feel too alive
Around you I got too much pride
Do we let it breathe or put a title on it?
I'm so indecisive, I'll let you decide
She like nah seem like your chakra's off
I'm like nah it's just that your top is off
And I started out wantin' to talk to you
And now all I can think about is poppin' off
Girl you're all that matters
You in bra and panties, that's automatic
You straddled me, I started fallin' backwards
Don't worry about the phone you can call them after
Bout to take ya down

[Hook]
All this weed in my system ain't helpin' (ain't helpin')
And this drank got you lookin' so good (so good)
I got some mollies in my hand, I might take one (take one)
And after I finish what's in my cup
You know I'm tryna love you
All these drugs-drugs make me wanna love you
Okay, okay, okay, okay[Produced by Curtis Heron]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply
Igh, igh-igh-igh, igh-igh, igh-igh, igh

[Interlude 1: Juicy J]
Yeah nigga, it's your boy Juicy J. Man, you gotta watch out for these old backstabbin', broke ass, you know what I'm sayin', jealous hatin' ass niggas out here man, you know what I'm sayin', man these niggas ain't no real niggas man, know what I'm sayin'? Man these niggas be smilin' in your face

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply

[Interlude 2: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back
No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back
B-Boy with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the mink back
Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
I'm a trend setter, you ain't even peep that
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that
(We ain't no fashion killas nigga, we fashionable killas
Ya'll got Flacko fucked up)

[Beat switch]

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp, bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch

[Outro: Juicy J]
Fake ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin'? These niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man niggas be gettin' extorted like a mothafucka out here man, you know what I'm sayin'?[Intro: Juicy J]
It's a lot been going on mane
Know what I'm sayin'?
Time for me to address this shit
Tired of hearing about it
Let's go, yeah

[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)]
(These hoes) They for everybody
Pass them all around, they at every party
They ain't gon be loyal, not for anybody
Still I love these hoes
(These hoes) They for everybody
Oh, that was your girl? Oops, I'm sorry
Don't bring her around, this just too much money
Yeah I love these hoes

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
She's a superfreak, superfreak
Met her in Liv last week
She was in there with Meek
In VIP, then she left with me
She said she fuck with Breezy
Do I wanna keep it? Nah, that ho too sleazy
Now she fuck with Jeezy
Don't believe me? The shit's all over TV
Now she work the pole, but you ain't know
That's how she make her dough
Seen her in New York
She was all throwed, forgot we met before
She say she fuck with Drake
I ain't surprised, all these hoes fucking with Drake
I asked why she out this way
Said she on a date, then she left with Trey
When will niggas learn?
Hoes like a doorknob, everybody gets a turn
Chicks be so high-class on the internet
But don't got shit she earned
She got that bag from Juicy J
She got that ass from Rudy Gay
Now your silly ass down on one knee
Fuck man, is you cray?

[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, I fell in love with a stripper
Funny thing is I fell back out of love quicker
They don't pay attention to love anyway
They only concerned with what the haters say
Bottles be turnin these girls into thots
Instagram turnin these wifes into hoes
No real life they just readin the comments
Mess with a real one and get you exposed
I had a time when my mine was caught up
My niggas was lookin like what is he on
My family was too scared to talk to a nigga
Ain't comin back now the case just got closed
She do what she told
Sharin' is carin' that pussy ain't gold
Sorry you ain't in control
You all about that money, thats shit that I throw
Just make sure you clean off that pole
They turn on the TV and get on the gram
And say that's relationship goals
Trust me don't save em' anything goes with...

[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)]

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Stop cuffing my nigga, is you the police?
Is you the police? Is you the police?
Why you cuffin' my nigga? Is you the police?
Is you the police? Is you the police?

[Hook: Juicy J & (Rock City)][Verse 1 – Young Dolph]
I don’t get mad, I just get paid
Smelling like a pound, walking in the bank
I been smoking weed, before the 5th grade
This a man’s world, bitch stay in your place
Shitting on your favorite rapper, did it by mistake
Went and got a mansion, went and got a maid
Naw I ain’t got a deal, but I got a Wraith
I call my clientele, I’m sorry for the wait
All these pounds in my traphouse, feel like I’m out of shape
These bitches love me man, I’m drinking muddy man
Drop a four in a ginger ale, it tastes like bubbly man
Young nigga hit a lick now you can’t tell me nothing man

[Hook x2 – Young Dolph]
Pulled up in a Porsche, pulled off in a Wraith
Pulled up in a Porsche, pulled off in a Wraith
Pulled up in a Porsche, pulled off in a Wraith
I saw my old bitch yesterday, you should’ve seen her face

[Verse 2 – 2 Chainz]
Pulled up in a Porsche, that bitch too anemic
Got that Rolls Royce, that bitch too conceited
Then I got them feet, had to get a pedi
Bought Keisha the Audi, you other niggas petty
Bet you ain’t got more money than harmony in heaven
Flat black Chevy, flat black MAC 11
I’m rolling up by the pound, you rolling up by the seven
Walk in the room with the black and white fur, that bitch that look like a panda
I put the slang in the gram, I just might loan your fam
I do this shit for Atlanta, shoot that bitch up with a cannon
All that I want is some Act, whip that shit up with a Fanta
Niggas don’t know how to act, when I pull up bitches pull out the cameras

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 – Juicy J]
Pulled up in that 9 11, pulled off in a Wraith
This my second one this year, it still got paper plates
I’m laughing out the lot the way I’m laughing to the bank, ha ha
All you niggas standing in line, you need more food to fill my plate
Swear you pussy niggas sweeter than some crème brulee
I got niggas in the kitchen that’ll razorblade your face
I’m frying chicken in my fucking Wraith, ghetto nigga
Eating Dodger’s chicken in my fucking Wraith, what can I say
Greasy fingers, spill some hot sauce on that leather suede ceiling
Barbeque interior, collard green exterior
All these cars outside I can’t decide which one to drive
And all these hoes outside I can’t decide which one I want inside

Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here

You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Hook: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho

Two more blunts, three more bitches
Four more zips, five more minutes
All I need is one more drank, one more drank
All I need is one more drank, one more drank

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
All I need is one more skank, dirty pussy, suck my dick
Scary movie, I let her use me, all in her mouth
My dick in her booty, we all on the couch, the cameras is out
And she say she a virgin, bitch, shut the fuck uuupp!
I'm 'bout my bread, gettin' throwed, gettin' blowed
Gettin' trippy, gettin' lit on these hoes
Fuck 'em slow, in my cup, colt 45, high as fuck
Twenty dab, hundred for the thousand dollar tab
Conjure my cab

[Hook x2: K. Camp]
All I need is one more drank
Two more blunts, three more bitches
Four more zips, five more minutes
All I need is one more drank, one more drank

Put this package, in yo box, you got mail
Smoke one more, touch that cloud, this that loud
That lil bitch, she get active, she get wild
We turnt up, too much liquor you can't hold me
Liked her pic, fucked her friend, now she know me
Drop my top, out that roof, that's that Rollie
Girl don't play, I'm right here, you gon' show me

[Hook x2: K. Camp]
All I need is one more drank
Two more blunts, three more bitches
Four more zips, five more minutes
All I need is one more drank, one more drank
All I need is one more drank, one more drank[Verse 1]
Rich nigga and I keep gunnas on my side
Niggas talk, hoes talk, but money don't lie
If you ain't heard, ain't another nigga triller
More Ace of Spades than a blackjack dealer
All in the club with Hollywood's finest
I'm bout to take Katy Perry to King of Diamonds
Ballin', ballin', pretty bitches jocking
If I sign her titties, she going to put it up for auction
Everywhere I go, they roll out the red carpet
I been sipping lean out of solid gold faucets
Respect the game, young nigga
Hating me ain't gonna make you no change, young nigga
Three bourgeoisie bitches and my Phantom outside
I leave it in park, cause they just want a ride
They just want to ride Juicy J like Six Flags
Then I kick them out so fast, they get whip lash

[The Come Up]

[Verse 2]
Brought my homeboys out the hood with me
Now a nigga sell dope records to make drug money
Shout out to the niggas that got love for me
Asian girl fainted as soon as she got a hug from me
Tokyo, that's a long way from North Memphis
Making too much money to be in yall's business
Making moves, chase the money till we all get it
And my pockets so deep, you can fall in them
Started from the bottom, my nigga
Six people, two bedroom apartment, my nigga
Now we pay cash for it all, fuck a lease
Still trying to get in touch with my homie Big Triece
Back-to-back Bentleys, foreign car fleet
NBA playoffs, we ball all week
I don't even hate the niggas hating on me
When their albums come out, I still buy their CDs
And that's real[Hook: Belly]
I know you probly think you're ballin' in the club
I'm ballin' every day, bitch I'm ballin' all my drugs
I spend a hundred stacks just to catch a fuckin' buzz
I'm ballin' every day, bitch I'm ballin' all my drugs
I'm ballin' all my drugs, we came in here 10 stacks strong

[Verse 1: Belly]
Getting money with them city boys
Fat fucker hitting hoes like a pretty boy
I swear these bitches got me losing weight
I might have to change my name like I'm tittie boy
Touchdown, I'm in the zone
I'm so retarded, I've been gone
I go in, you been home
It goes down, syndrome
Please excuse my demeanor
You know I lean by the liter
You know I'm all about numbers
3 hoes, 2 seater
Bitch is crashing on my couch, that's extended stacks
Molly all on the tongue, she's got expensive taste
2 stacks on the weed, she drive a Chevrolet
I pull on her hair just to see if her extensions stay
Ignoramus, bitch I'm famous
Let's see how far you can make it
Never thought you'd get this faded
This shit here is different, ain't it?
Hundred stacks, worth the mess for the damn pain
What the fuck's a couple racks worth of champagne

Niggas ain't in my tax bracket
Any number, I make it happen
Big money on big money
Lemonade and gin and tonic
Bad bitches, I've been on that
That's my car, I'm sittin' on it
I can't get out, I put the can on it
I can't get out, I put the can on it
Cuz when a nigga get rich, bitches tryna hit tricks
Angelina on Brad Pitt, vixens tryna make a flick
Yea, I smoke a lot of weed
I ain't never seen a seed
Juicy J the money mane and I come from Ten a K
All my niggas sellin' dope
All my niggas blowin' trees
Every day full 20
I don't show no favoritism
Ain't no limit to the business
Wanna go and get it
And if it ain't smokin' it ain't no far in it

Ridin' in my black Bonneville bumpin' Three Six
Roll up twenty Zig Zags out of one zip
Roll up twenty Zig Zags out of one zip
Roll up, roll up twenty Zig Zags out of one zip

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yessir.....
Ridin' in the ghost, trippin' on dope
Drankin' the fifth, passin' a roach
Ball like I'm Kobe, when straight to the pro's
White girls with money, bank on my coat
Higher than I've ever been, drankin' some gin
Let the hoes in, tell em bring a few friends
Smoking on the top, ashing on you fuck niggas
Eye's low, pop a Xan, I'm drunk nigga
Pounds laying around my crib Juicy J ain't never even touch
Shawty passed out on the floor and she only hit the cheese weed once
Ain't no Chips Ahoy but this nigga right here keep cookies
Keep some OG, you motherfuckin' niggas know I ain't no rookie
Liars say you smokin', hit a few times and you niggas be chokin'
She don't even hit the weed all she do is break it down and roll it
Anti-sober, if I was probably be trippy
One ain't enough, I'm rollin up two extensions
All my real niggas smoke one if you with it
All my bad bitches smoke one if you feel it

[Hook x2]
Ridin' in my black Bonneville bumpin' Three Six
Roll up twenty Zig Zags out of one zip
Roll up twenty Zig Zags out of one zip

I'm in the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

[Juicy J x2]
J’s on my feet
J’s on my feet
J’s on my feet
So get like me

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I be in the club standing on the couch
In them Wolf Greys like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check
I back it up, cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m Hip-Hop Hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I’m ’bout to turn up now

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in the club high on purp with some shades on
Tatted up, mini skirt with my J's on

J’s on my feet
J’s on my feet

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I be rockin' J's or
I be rockin' Taylors
I got lots of flavors, my kick game is major
More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away
I’m naughty by nature like I’m Hip-Hop Hooray
With my hands in the sky, I wave ‘em from side to side
My feet on the floor, I’m ’bout to turn up now

I got thirty pair of J's that ain't never been released
Flu game twelve, Space Jam 11
On the hype beast sick, they gon' need a paramedic
Turn up, turn up, turn up, I get trippy, I stay live
All this purple in my cup, match them grape 5's
I'm so high, I got three bitches that go bi
I'm so fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow dryer

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Step up in this bitch, you know I got my weapon
This ain't a gym class, why is everybody sweating

I'm in this bitch I'm looking birdy
You know the coupe is bloody murder
The coupe is bloody murder
Yeah that motherfucker black
Let's all pour color purple

Do them numbers in his head
Swear that nigga smart as Urkel
Mirror, mirror, should I kill them
Gourmet to the Tims
400 for this four door, and it ain't got no rims
Tell my waitress keep them bottles coming
I'm drinking like a fish

All you bitches make a wish

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
How much liquor it gonna take to get it cracking in this bitch
Look I came to get it in now why you acting this bitch

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Motion picture shit, nigga I pull up in slo-mo

Shit I git a new , I'll send you to Pluto
Got a street nigga, but you knew that from the get-go
I'm turnt up to the max, and I'm just stunting on these niggas
I'm real as they say, so I'm holding court on these niggas
Wife beaters and jeans, and a pair of Jordans on these niggas
Head cocked to the back, and I smash the sport on these niggas
You get money then show it, if you ain't then stop lying
If you looking for a nigga, bitch I ain't hard to find
Only nigga in the city, million dollars a car
How you kick it with the goon, you meant to be with the star

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Turn down for what
Made a few mill off two flows
Big dog, Cujo
Your man here, you mad now
In the booty club, I'm the cash cow
We turning up, we broke the knob up
I'm on Xanex, trying not to nod off
Finna bust your bitch like a sawed off
Making NBA money, I'm a ball hog
Big blunts and nigga still facing
Bank account look like The Matrix
Niggas be acting still hating
I'm rich and I stay super faded
Pouring up that Bombay, let that reefer burn
Getting gobbled by your bitch, my nigga wait your turn
Groupie bitches on my balls
Got them dancing with the stars
Once a million dollar nigga
Half a million dollar cars
Have to love them ratchet bitches
They get 2 Live with the Crew
Make them pop that pussy open
Man I feel like Uncle Luke

I'm always on the go I'm a motherfucking hustler
Never forget my lil homies in them project house
Shout out to all my lil dawgs in them FED walls

Addicted to the cheddar like  junkie to the yayo
All my niggas eatin', every place I'm stackin'

[Verse 2: Juicy J](Juicy J speaking)
(You ever had niggas that was with you since the beginning
Its the same niggas who started catching feelings
When the money got real, success was knocking on your door like a police on a maintenance man tryna get in)
Shit so hard when you gotta cut a nigga off
Your friend, your ace
Ten years now, can't look at your face
Fuck what I say
You ain't the nigga I knew since the dope days, shit
Since the cold days
You just like the rest of the so called A1 niggas who turned stake soft
It's me against the world everyday mo' money  mo' hoes fuck famous
Bad bitches entertainment
Life full of changes
I'm feeling brainless
Stacking money in my bedroom
I can finally go to sleep
Feeling rich as fuck I'm never givin' up, don't fuck with me
My true A1 never turn his back
Never stole from and turned to crack
Took his dope and he turned to rack
Put Memphis on the map
Bought the game and than he sold it back
I look in the mirror he looking right back
The feeling is real, if I die on this track
If I die on this track

[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm fucking with my homies, I'm fucking with my A1's

Trippy Nation nigga
Young Ced on the beat, watch these snitches mane

[Hook x2: Juicy J]
These nigga's dropping dimes, they some real snitches
The only dimes that I ever dropped was some bitches
I’ma cut some fingers, I’ma clip some tongues
Cause all that point in talkin' ain’t allowed where I’m from

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Nigga stuck off in the fare, fucking with them bricks
His partners put them laws on him, over a bitch
These pussy nigga's scared, don’t wanna take they charge
They swear they hard but they softer then cotton balls (ho)
Real nigga's go to jail and don’t tell them nothing (true)
Do that time, come back home then get back to hustling (true)
We got everything for sale, but the kitchen sink (true)
Keep my eyes on you snakes, I don’t even blink (bitch)
Boy you scared, you gonna tell them white folks everything (yes sir)
To cut your time, you gonna give up errybody name (pussy)
Snitching nigga you ain’t straight, them folks gonna find you dead
Cut your tongue out your mouth and put one in ya head

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
The bigger the gun, the bigger the slug
The bigger the hole for doc to plug
Holdin' your head, I put you to sleep
Body not found, mama gon’ weep
Droppin the dime and runnin your mouth
Nowhere to run, down in the south
Meet ya wrong, I hop on the phone
Goons on route, burners out
You screamin' pig, I blow up your wig
Vocals smokin' just like a cig
Blowin' on kush and sippin' on hen
Forgive me father for your sin
Meet ya wrong, I'm able again
Convicted felon, back in the pen
Pistol in face, you wit attention
They goin' for twelve, I got em for ten
He threw me them bowls, he knew I'm a boss
He looking for bread, he know that’s a loss
I cross em a corn, mixed somethin' me deal
And separate the fact from the real
You play the cards, bet you a deal
Behind them bars, now you gon’ squeal
You playin' these streets, we playin' for real
Jail come wit it, swallow that meal

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Driicky Graham]
Prime time snitchin' lies, got line twistin' guys
Take the clip to make a flick no blind side or district 9
Trying to dodge prison time, all die for fishin' by
Smith and 9's (pow pow pow), if you mention mines
One: put you in a scope, two: clack then it's smoke
Three. scoop you up and put ya body in a envelope
Four: send yo folks jus ya head, chest, guts
Now you leakin' body stinkin' up the Fed Ex truck
And that fed pressure, makes the snitches wanna roast you
They start droppin dimes like they coins miss the toll booth
God as my witness man I swear to tell the whole truth
Where I'm from we gets it done and act like we don't know dude

[Intro]
Still winning, we gonna stay get money
So you niggas know what it is, 4/20 bitch

[Hook x2]
High ain't no coming down
Roll up let's burn up
Turn up ain't no turning down
Chasing this fast money ain't no slowing down
Hol' up let's pour up for up cause it's going down

[Verse 1]
Break it down, rolling up
My money too long can't fold it up
Poured up I'm drunk as fuck
I take more alcohol than a open cut
Early morning getting to the bread
So I call it breakfast in bed
Real nigga don't believe in ghost
But I'm stil chasing these dead prez
My eyes so low, I'm so lit
I might nod off after one more hit
In a foreign whip with a foreign bitch
I live every night like a porno flick
Bitch don't kill my vibe, ho don't kill my buzz
Bitch I'm so fresh and clean but my cup is full of mud
If she not fucking she gotta go
One monkey won't stop the show
I'm backstage with a flock of hoes
And I'm getting blowed like snotty noes
Hollywood I'm still stuntin', makin' paper all around the country
I'm getting throwed, fucking hoes, getting dome and counting money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let's blow it all can't take it with us
Step out the car they takin' pictures
That's paparazzi, that's TMZ
My Mercedes Benz that's AMG
Eyes like I'm chinese, out in Tokyo
Check my passport homie I do global shows
And I stay high ain't coming down
Smoking light green, don't fuck with brown
Rollin' up that loud, your dope ain't making no sound
I roll through the hood in that new Bugatti coupe
Pull up on yo baby momma, she treat my dick like a flute
Juicy J kilin' the game, go ahead and buy you a suit
I spend yo ho signing bonus on just one pair of shoes
Let's get high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
Pour up a deuce
Matter fact make that four
Ok, now you got the juice

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x4]
And I stay high, ain't coming down
Smoke light green, don't fuck with brown

[Outro]

That's trippy shit right here bruh

[Hook]
Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down

Don't pass me no regular, I'mma turn it down
All I blow is loud, All I blow is loud
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'mma turn it down, and be turnt up
I'm burnin' loud til my lungs burnt up

[Verse 1]
Smokin' gas in a rental
She givin' me mental
Countin faces (countin faces)
While she poppin molly like mentos
I got money forreal though
Split blunts down the middle
I got love for everybody, who give a fuck how you feel though
In a big house with 10 hoes
Catch me in the hills blowin endo
Pool party, that's indoors
So much gin, take a swim ho
Homie pass the weed, let's get super high
I smoke that shit that made R. Kelly think that he could fly
Droppin racks off one plate
Took her to the strip then blew it
Took a lot of gin and some pills, took her to my hotel room like screw it
Smokin on pounds, smokin on pounds
In Seattle where ain't no crime
All I do is smoke weed and rhyme
Sip codeine just to ease my mind

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Chugging on lean and I’m chiefing on skunk
With your main girl, eat my dick like its lunch
Kick it so tough, you would think I’m gon punt
Nigga so high, you would think I’m gon jump
Upwards and downwards just like a seesaw
Her titties keep bouncing just like a beach ball
She’s on one, I’m on two, we smoking, we fucking
On so many drugs that we can’t sleep it off
Goons on my side, I got cars I don’t drive
Got a bitch in my bed that’s somebody’s bride
Got kush in my blunt, got lean in my sprite
I’m drunk as a fish and I’m high as a kite
Two dime bitches and I’m in the middle
Maybach come with curtains, I ain’t got tinted windows
Eyes stay low, I look oriental
That’s the killer loud pack in my cigarillo
No Reggie in my presence, tell them niggas get it right
I got girls doing girls, now that’s the shit I like
Now that’s the shit I love, give me pussy, money, drugs
I take thirty out my stash and go blow it with my blood

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Damn I miss the '90s, yeah shit was wild
We was livin' like rock stars, droppin' Mystic Styles
Ain't nobody else believe in what we was puttin' down
Nigga almost homeless trying to get it off the ground
No support everybody thought we never be shit
Tryna start our own label on some Master P shit
Tryna get some distribution majors labels ain't feelin' us
Doors slammed in our face, still ain't givin' up
Still on the grind, still on the rise
Even had to sell my whip to pay for studio time
Made a name, made some change, got respect, got some fame
Now they love our shit, cuz we made our own lane
Tryna sign everybody, put some money in their pockets
Had a ball on the rug, every night we had it poppin'
They ain't hold us down, did it on our own
With our backs on da wall, we put plaques on the wall
Then the problems started picking up, posse start splitting up
People started switching up, we still not giving up
I love them though, we been through it all
They're my brothers though, now that's some real shit
We weren't always rich, we didn't have a pot to piss
Hustle harder than a bitch, slanging records like they bricks
From the ground to the throne, its been a hell of a trip
Bring me one more drank, while I sit and reminisce[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I pop up on yo' block, pull up on yo street
Girl, first I got your number, then I got under them sheets
Then I hopped on top of these beats, I ain't been home in weeks
Yeah, I know you tryna eat, but, nigga, I'm tryna feast, so I gotta go
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
Wasn't feelin' lil mama, had to fall back
Hit my phone, ain't talk no dope, I don't call back
Write these verses so, player, we read verses in Isaiah
Baby ain't even gotta state it, she know that I'm a smooth operator
Baby talk too much and I don't like that
Gotta leave tomorrow and I ain't book my flight yet
Sometimes, no matter what you do, they forget about all that
But I know they gon' remember me, cause a boy all that
I'm ballin', she want it, I get it, I get it
I'm plugged in, got friends that, spend millions

[Hook x2: Casey Veggies]
We got hoes, we got drinks, we got all that
She gon' go, she don't think, she do all that
They don't think we from the streets, but I'm bout all that
I came up from the bottom, I do all that

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
All of these bitches be jockin', all of these niggas keep hatin'
I get Jacksons, Grants, and Franklins so we call that changin' faces
Stuntin' off in the Bugatti, drive so fast you think I'm racing
My nigga, this weed so strong, I'm gone, you might think I laced it
Ballin', bitch, I thought you knew
If you niggas had my paper, you'd be ballin' too
Teach a nigga how to stunt, I should start a school
All I do is press a button just to start the coupe
Swimmin' in so many women, I lost count
Once they give me that pussy, homie, I dog 'em out
If you ain't talkin' bout money then what you talkin' about?
If they say money talks, then my dollars shout
Popsicles on my chain, ice cubes on my wrist
Snow cones on my fingers, yo' bitch on my dick
Street nigga, still have a mill up in my shoe box
Old school, still keep a stash in my tube socks
Kush, all up in my rollin' papers
Got me coughin' like a cancer patient
Countin' cash like a calculator
OG still gettin' dome like activator, all that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I fuck bitches, I get money, I do all that
Niggas want me to impress 'em, they can fall back
I'd be trippin' if I told you I was all rap
I got stocks, I got blocks, nigga, hold that
Wal-Mart prices on the roll backs
Cheap shit, nigga, we don't know that
Expensive, designer, we spendin', we spendin'
I'm ballin', got friends that's, Egyptian
And I'm out for that payback
Got a couple niggas that stay strapped, yeah
New school had a nigga trippin'
But my old bitch helped me get my soul back, yeah
I started off in a Sonata, then I went and got me a Range
Then I went and got me a Beamer, now a few of my homies do the same
Nigga we don't care about chains, I can shine in white T
That's pro'ly why yo' bitch like me
Low key she wanna be my wifey, I'm thinkin' that she might be
Show her shit you never show her
She wanna get high I insert with a quarter
We playin' games, you out of order
Thirsty nigga need water, you know you can't afford her, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Ty Dolla $ign]
She got blunts, I got papers, we got all that
We gon' smoke, we gon' fuck, we did all that
Homies trippin' and we trippin', we with all that
Pint of act, double cups, we got all that
Lil bruh fought his case, just gave him all day
Baby Buddha in there too, he got all day
Time goes by, puffin' on shake
Just to keep him high, watch the time waste
L.A. niggas in Atlanta strip clubs
Smoking good, eating good, I just fell in love
Lil bitch told the homie she don't have sex
We already fucked, you ain't gotta flex

[Hook][Intro : Juicy J]
Security fucked up let me bring the zip in
Yo bitch missing we both missing we both disappear
If I pull up in that Phantom she gon' disappear
If I pull up in a Phantom we gon' disappear

[Hook x2: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
She's drunk already
I'm lit already
What you mean roll up
What you mean burn up

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Let's talk money shit I'm rich already
Let's get freaky baby call me Robert Kelly
I'm at Penthouse watching bitches shake their jelly
Weed and Liquor make her look like Halle Berry
I'm lit don't wear no panties
Let them kids stay with their granny
This dick you about to swallow save that fuck shit for your marriage
Ho I'm Juicy J, to fuck me is a dream
Ziploc full of trees, hypnotize your mind then I leave
Money over hoes by any means, Me
Eight hundred thousand in jewelry I got Egyptian needs
Grab my Phantom keys, pour me a little lean
You niggas out here saving thots I share them with the team
Fuck boy (But anyway...)

[Hook: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi](x2)

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Already told you niggas that I ain't gon' play
Already told my ho she better stop complaining
Damn that nigga already got that shiny bezel
Told that nigga I'm already on another level
Local thotties at this party already bopping
I just walked in thirty seconds getting topped off
God damn why I keep on shaking niggas hot sauce?
Pull up in that new Camaro I just left that sky loft
I promise I've already sipped
Woah, I told your ho come take a trip
If she bite then I know I’m fucking
If she hop inside the passenger I know I'm busting

Fuck a nigga, that goes to anybody
Fuck a ho, these hoes anybody
I'll up that strap on anybody
I'm getting bread, you can ask anybody

[Verse 1]
Grab a bitch by the neck
Say bitch can ya suck a dick
Niggas talk behind my back
I can get you for a cheque
If I don't fuck with you niggas, that ain't never gonna change
I'm a trill OG, don't associate with no lames
I got drugs all in my system, put slugs all in yo frame
Respect this or get a death wish, or don't give a fuck about fame
Cuz I started watching niggas get paper
I came up and I turned the tables
See my money is like now and laters
I'm getting paid right now and later
I blow more grass than a gardener
Save the bullshit for a farmer
I woke up and bought a Fisker, call that good karma

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Swimming in dough, drowning in ounce
I take yo ho, drive around in my Benz
Its a 4 door, so she brung her friends
3am now I'm swimming it in
You a bitch and you know it, that's why you hate on my grind
And you know I'm winning and you can't deny
Say you not eating my nigga, you on a no money diet
You wan't a problem take mine, I'll gun you down if you try
Bulletproof vests, we dressing for war cuz we know whats next
Better be strapped, if ya don't react, put a bulls eye down on yo hat
You can die in yo tracks, see if yo homeboy got yo back
Niggas these choppas full and these bullets hungry and you look just like a snack

[Hook x2][Lord Infamous]
One cold winter of many tales
Trails of blood left in frozen snow
A family slaughtered by a loved one, forgive scarecrow
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts
Found staked on the floor soaked in evidence of the root of violence
Only a teen, sent to spend my final life in an insane asylum
So a few years have passed, I'm an adult I feel better now
But no matter, I tell them that I know they'll never let me out
I rot in this dread, my only world's the one in my head
I hate psycho-therapists, I walk amongst walking dead
Everday, yes every-single day, peepin' ways to escape
I got to find a way out this place, it's a must, got to find a way
I'm pullin hair up out my freakin' head yo
They tranquilize a nigga put his ass in a choke
I wanna go psycho and kill these mutha fuckin' folks
But in a padded room I know I'll never get up out this hole
I'm pacin' back and forth across this room
I gotta think of somethin, man I got to make a move
The day I killed my fuckin' family in a week or two
I got to get up back out there I wanna do it again fool
Gettin' cool with the old ass maintenance man
I told him "If you help me out I'd put a lotta papes in your hand
I stashed a lotta dough in dirt before a nigga left it
If you help me out when I get out I'll give you half on that deal"
The old man with it, he grinnin', astray
Look here gramps, meet me at my door for the plan round 'bout 8
Check it pops, you got to get a shovel and a pine box
Put me in the ground and dig me out once they talk to the cops
I'm gonna need a slight overdose of some mother fuckin' sleepin' pills
So while I'm waitin in the dirt I won't breathe up the air in here
Sneak in the office get the keys off of Dr. Malique
And while you doin that I'll take the pills so I fall asleep
I started feelin' my awareness fadin' away
I could slightly hear all the dirt gettin' tossed on to the pine crate
I awoke and in my square waiting to be freed
But from the light I seen
Someone killed the maintenance man and threw him in with me

I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?
I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?[Verse 1]
You been watching this nigga
Waiting on him to slip
You spot him at the light my nigga
In a Bentley while you creepin’ in that black Crown Vic
Pull up to the curb my nigga
Even out here balling and his family broke as shit
You think he give a fuck my nigga
Looking dead at a nigga down a barrel of your gun
Now look into his eyes my nigga
Will he die, will he live, will he beg like a bitch?
Or will he testify my nigga?
This is nigga hold it, Who gone catch it first
Somebody about to die my nigga
Niggas catchin’ grip on that gap
Make him wear chains on his neck
His face with diamonds, ice in his mouth
Fuck that nigga smile
Cause he knows that if you don’t let the choppers fly
He knows somebody gonna kill him on the other side
He knows somebody waitin’ all up in his momma house
He knows somebody
Fuck this baby momma now
It’s time for the come up
Nigga this it
Glock 19 15 in the clip
It’s up to you and God my nigga

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not, last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Verse 2]
Another day, another dollar
You spending on the car my nigga
Living fast, fuck the law
You ain’t worried about the cops my nigga
Your last hope you a father
You told to get a job my nigga
You just bought a new burden
The last one was hot my nigga
Everybody showing love in the streets
You a hood celebrity
Everybody knows that you’re the plug
You the nigga that they wanna be
But there’s somebody waiting on you my nigga
Don’t sleep
A black bag with a black man in a black crowd
Creepin’ on you
But you don’t give a fuck when you’re out in the streets
Dollars in the chain
Nigga you’re the hood grip
Hit the corner store for some lick
You close your eyes when you about to die
One of these niggas sound like you

[Outro]
Last night I had a bad dream
