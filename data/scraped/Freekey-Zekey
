(Cam'ron)
Well, I'mma tell you straight up, homeboy cause it's a cold world
Your wife, I call her "Oh girl" her head makes my toes curl
And she awfully thick, help me get off these bricks
Coffee kick, but after I bust, I be like "Get the fuck off me bitch"
If she front, bruise her in the ribs
But you hugged her, you loved her, moved her in the crib
Hit by cupid, stupid, why'd you do it? Why be bother?
Why you holla? Three babies, three baby fathers
Get wise kid, open your eyelids, cause that last abortion?
That was my kid, that's right, but that I ain't followin'
If she get pregnant again, it'd be from swallowin'
But once in a while I dive in it, that car you bought?
I be drivin' it, head while I'm drivin it
Said you like to lay up dog, and play footies
But she need a nigga with timbs, gats and straight hoodies

[Guy] I got timbs, dog

(Cam'ron)
Well..she said you gotta get drunk, and I could fuck her better sober
You get 20 grams, and think you fucking Erick Sosa
Better choke her, she the female Bill Clinton
Lie, Cheat and Smoke, you got her still sittin'
Then she bouncin' in, so you wanna pounce her in
She gas you up, "I love you, I swear to God we'll go to counseling"
I ain't cherish ya cutie, inherit the booty
Havin' her want to kill you like American Beauty Killa
Cause you a motherfucking rest haven
I Put a gun to her head, paint a picture like Wes Craven
Ya chest achin', cause I'm very blunt, ya stunt, wanna cherry pump
Any extra kid, an extra check every month
She givin' Jimmy head, Jeulz in her guts
Dog, you feel in love wit a slut, What

[Hook]

Aiyoo, me and Cam caught her, on camcorder
Dogged her, kicked her out the O

You thinking I'm frontin', she got a birth mark between her tits
And money, please stop calling niggas phones harassin'
She come home, don't wanna fuck, we boned her back in
You's a creep, and all do is use your freak
And when we done, we send her home for you to keep
You want beef? Punk faggot, we got stupid heat
Aiyoo, you acting like you gonna die over pussy

Yo, she greet me on GP, you buyin' the pussy
Breathin hard on the other line, diein' to push me

Nigga please, I'm quick to put three in a nigga
You ain't nothing but a sucka for love
She got you thinking it's love
Hit her on the sink or in the tub
A little head crack, while a nigga drinkin' a bub
You be surprised what ya bitch could do
She did shit to us, she never did to you

[Freaky Zeekey Talking]
Yo, give me the motherfucking phone nigga

She just got finished soaking my dick in her mouth nigga
You put time in this ho, "Oh let me take her out Benihama's

[Verse 1: Freekey Zeykey]

Ur man got the debs

She know how to whip
She got a funny rhyme with a nice hook
She know how to spit
She got a big gun with a big clip
She know to hit
I wanna lick her toes, wanna lick her chest
Wanna lick for lips
Muah, gotta give her kiss
Cuz I know dat she taste good (good) like
'Donalds french fries
She taste like 'Donalds french fries
But its hard to get to her
Like she took both the wings
Off the V & the flying spur
I can see her plain as day
Cuz the light off the chain
Make her light like she on the stage
I gotta get to her
But I can ne-ne-never reach her

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]

Ooooooooo she was fly
But I was lookin at her shoes
Da louis vuttons & I was watchin every move
The birkin bag & she was workin the swagga
& I said lil mama can I get at you? (What did she do?)
She rolled her eyes like she was playin
So hard to get (What you do?)
Said to myself she ain't seen the hard top yet (Then what?)
I ain't come with no chauffeur
Its jus me in the roadster
& I said lil mama can I get at you (What she say?)
Then she said that she dont do rappers
I replied that I can be a chiropractor
Better yet I could a contractor
Get up in the buildin tear walls down
You can line them up & I'll tear all down
Tried to get the numba but then she di-di-disappeared in the crowd

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

She got that long hair she booku fine
I got that long hair I let her pull mine
She got them pretty feet nice smile

[Hook][Intro Cam'ron]
Uhh Wave your hands man Yo I'm looking for a ho

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo Holla Yo

And she down son Plus she pushed a Beamer
I should've knew something was up from the jump
When I passed ma the blunt the bitch was a Steamer
I ain't care I had weed to blow
I ain't feed the ho We took a trip to Argentina
I don't know why a guy would pause
I went raw inside the whore I thought she would be cleaner
The dirty bitch burnt me that concerned
Now I'm thirsty I'm looking for her with the NINA
I'mma kill her when I see her so
(Tell me have you seen her) (Tell me have you seen her)

[Hook 2x]
It be them girls with the pretty face and the pretty eyes
Pretty thighs but what about they insides?
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off now its on fire tonight

[Verse 2]
It's like treat her like a prostitute (prostitute)
Don't treat no girly good don't ever show her yo loot
Girly see you riding' wanna roll in the Coupe
See you a ice cream want you to throw her a scoop
I don't get mad tell her to blow on my flute
Before the I-E you got to throw in the group groupie
Sad I read it ooh wee I'm glad you did it
Sue me what you mad I said it
Put front back side to side
Never let a broke ass female ride
I learned that down south niggas in Texas
Before I tricked her I buy bigger Biggatses
Imagine me get a biggatses get her a Lexus
You figuring reckless maybe I'm sexist
So back up let me strap up
Before you give Cam that clap up I'm gone have to clack up

[Talking]

When you gonna die in life there's no prevention
Why the fuck you put us here when you know we bad

[Cam'ron]
Yo I can't live up in Hollow Hills with some model thrills
Why for the dollar bills I got the bottle Crils
I don't have to swallow pills
Why when I'm starvin I got to gobble meals
Why did I cop to steal
Why did I ride ride for real
Why we can't wait til our time God could take her
Why the flesh eatin disease make niggas get ate her
Why bitches with a fat ass gotta wear A cup
Why Dave Listern from the NBA-a
Why the great ones always break up
And when travisty happen they wanna make up
Why niggas can't get caked up and stay caked up
Say what why we can't tell who's smart or dumb
Why niggas in blue suits gotta take us and put us in orange one
Why Adam and Eve didn't know what was in the garden dun
Why niggas from America always wanna cart to foreign land
My drugs I gotta buy why sluts gotta fly why thugs gotta cry
Why when I get on blood got to die
Why me and Tai can't see eye to eye
Why when plane crashes niggas fly to die
Why were depend on a handshake when you reachin a palm
Why beef with my mom why can't sleep when I cum
Why my black I love every fight I laugh when they mug me every right
I got to fuck every night
Run deep in my ways six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain't retreated to slaves
Why we don't learn til we leave for the cage
And we say the beasts is in rage
Why I can't tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Whys no such thing as true lies
Why can't I have two rather than few highs
Whys homos got to do guys in the world
Why ain't there more girls that wanna do girls
Whys multiple-sclorosis why got multiple intosis
You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight flurges I see crook type murders
And niggas get cooked like burgers
Why your girl want my clique why your girl on my dick
Why she rub it against her mouth like it's chap stick
Why this rap shit
Why CEOs wanna rap why rappers wanna be CEOs
Yo why you all wanna see me blow
Why the rederick why I can't get my proper etiquette

[Outro]
Better get all your money motherfucker get that said again

I'm looking sharper than a razor
Smoking on some haze, riding low pro
Chopping on them blades

Coming down the block, bet you all the bitches jock

Cloudy ass diamonds, thunder storm jewels
Fuck nigga, don't trip, my fours make you holler
Candy paint gators, matching the Impala

Stone cold sinner, got the heat when I'm flossin'
Hold up your horses, your boy and his horsemen
His move and be cautious
Don't wanna see none of ya'll stiff in the coffin

My mans Zeek always told me a ho's gon' be a ho let a ho fly
Let the birds fucking fly let 'em fly right Zeek? (Don't Let Em Fly Away)

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo Holla Yo
I need a girl that can sing like Selena, ass like Trina
Tits like Janet, get beat like Tina (Have you seen her)
I mean cake like Oprah chauffeur
Keep the toaster in the Holster (Tell me have you seen her)
I did yeah I found one a little brown one
And she down son Plus she pushed a Beamer
I should've knew something was up from the jump
When I passed ma the blunt the bitch was a Steamer
I ain't care I had weed to blow
I ain't feed the ho We took a trip to Argentina
I don't know why a guy would pause
I went raw inside the whore I thought she would be cleaner
The dirty bitch burnt me that concerned
Now I'm thirsty I'm looking for her with the NINA
I'mma kill her when I see her so
(Tell me have you seen her) (Tell me have you seen her)

[Hook 2x]
It be them girls with the pretty face and the pretty eyes
Pretty thighs but what about they insides?
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off now its on fire tonight

[Verse 2]
It's like treat her like a prostitute (prostitute)
Don't treat no girly good don't ever show her yo loot
Girly see you riding' wanna roll in the Coupe
See you a ice cream want you to throw her a scoop
I don't get mad tell her to blow on my flute
Before the I-E you got to throw in the group groupie
Sad I read it ooh wee I'm glad you did it
Sue me what you mad I said it
Put front back side to side
Never let a broke ass female ride
I learned that down south niggas in Texas
Before I tricked her I buy bigger Biggatses
Imagine me get a biggatses get her a Lexus
You figuring reckless maybe I'm sexist
So back up let me strap up
Before you give Cam that clap up I'm gone have to clack up

[Talking]

[Hook]After Talking(Yo, pass me that phone)
Cam: Hello?
Guy: Yo, yo, can I speak to Cam?
Cam: Fuck is this B? State ya name

Cam: Hold up, hold up, hold up calm down man
You keep it gully and all this? What's going on

Guy: Doggie, doggie, you don't know me doggie

I'mma catch you, word up (*screaming, phone clicks*)
[Cam] Niggas is fucking crazy

(*guy talks over beat*)

(Cam'ron)
Well, I'mma tell you straight up, homeboy cause it's a cold world
Your wife, I call her "Oh girl" her head makes my toes curl
And she awfully thick, help me get off these bricks
Coffee kick, but after I bust, I be like "Get the fuck off me bitch"
If she front, bruise her in the ribs
But you hugged her, you loved her, moved her in the crib
Hit by cupid, stupid, why'd you do it? Why be bother?
Why you holla? Three babies, three baby fathers
Get wise kid, open your eyelids, cause that last abortion?
That was my kid, that's right, but that I ain't followin'
If she get pregnant again, it'd be from swallowin'
But once in a while I dive in it, that car you bought?
I be drivin' it, head while I'm drivin it
Said you like to lay up dog, and play footies
But she need a nigga with timbs, gats and straight hoodies

[Guy] I got timbs, dog

(Cam'ron)
Well..she said you gotta get drunk, and I could fuck her better sober
You get 20 grams, and think you fucking Erick Sosa
Better choke her, she the female Bill Clinton
Lie, Cheat and Smoke, you got her still sittin'
Then she bouncin' in, so you wanna pounce her in
She gas you up, "I love you, I swear to God we'll go to counseling"
I ain't cherish ya cutie, inherit the booty
Havin' her want to kill you like American Beauty Killa
Cause you a motherfucking rest haven
I Put a gun to her head, paint a picture like Wes Craven
Ya chest achin', cause I'm very blunt, ya stunt, wanna cherry pump
Any extra kid, an extra check every month
She givin' Jimmy head, Jeulz in her guts
Dog, you feel in love wit a slut, What

[Hook]
Guy: Aiyyo, what's up with my girl that's my world?
Cam: She a slut ho
Guy: That's my life, that's my wife I love her
Cam: Uh-oh, oh no, oh God
Guy: Aiyyo, what's up with my girl that's my world
Cam: She a slut ho
Guy: That's my live, that's my wife, I love her
Cam: Uh-oh, Oh no, Oh God, she a slut, she a freak

Yo, Gruff, tell us more about his fucking ho

[McGruff]
Aiyoo, me and Cam caught her, on camcorder
Dogged her, kicked her out the O
Tell you about ya ho, she's a bitch
Came right between her lips
You thinking I'm frontin', she got a birth mark between her tits
And money, please stop calling niggas phones harassin'
She come home, don't wanna fuck, we boned her back in
You's a creep, and all do is use your freak
And when we done, we send her home for you to keep
You want beef? Punk faggot, we got stupid heat
Aiyoo, you acting like you gonna die over pussy
I ain't gonna front, I was hazed up, high in the pussy
Yo, she greet me on GP, you buyin' the pussy
Breathin hard on the other line, diein' to push me
Crime crime, sip fine wine, puff lime, lime
Laughing at the bitch on Primetime
Me and Killa for reala, all of the sudden you wanna be a Gorilla
Nigga please, I'm quick to put three in a nigga
You ain't nothing but a sucka for love
She got you thinking it's love
Hit her on the sink or in the tub
A little head crack, while a nigga drinkin' a bub
You be surprised what ya bitch could do
She did shit to us, she never did to you
That ho mad psychical, cheesy bitch

[Freaky Zeekey Talking]
Yo, give me the motherfucking phone nigga
This stupid ass nigga coming around here
Dailing my number, how the fuck he get the...
Listen nigga, ya BITCH ain't shit anyway
Her pussy no quality, and how the fuck you gonna take
This motherfucking ho to the Hotel?
She ain't nothin' but backseat, backshots
You talking about "Oh I wanna soak ya feet baby
I had a long day, I wanna make you feel right"
She just got finished soaking my dick in her mouth nigga
You put time in this ho, "Oh let me take her out Benihama's
Oh let me get some Dolce and Gabbana"
Motherfucker, I don't even know ya ho

I wanna lick her toes, wanna lick her chest
Wanna lick for lips
Muah, gotta give her kiss
Cuz I know dat she taste good (good) like
'Donalds french fries
She taste like 'Donalds french fries
But its hard to get to her
Like she took both the wings
Off the V & the flying spur
I can see her plain as day
Cuz the light off the chain
Make her light like she on the stage
I gotta get to her
But I can ne-ne-never reach her

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]

Ooooooooo she was fly

& I said lil mama can I get at you? (What did she do?)
She rolled her eyes like she was playin
So hard to get (What you do?)
Said to myself she ain't seen the hard top yet (Then what?)
I ain't come with no chauffeur
Its jus me in the roadster
& I said lil mama can I get at you (What she say?)
Then she said that she dont do rappers
I replied that I can be a chiropractor
Better yet I could a contractor
Get up in the buildin tear walls down
You can line them up & I'll tear all down
Tried to get the numba but then she di-di-disappeared in the crowd

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

She got that long hair she booku fine

Don't need the cage cuz the bird's in the engine
Just bought a crib, eight rooms, all kitchens
And I pimp so hard, I need to stop, make the women
But they don't feel me though

See I got a whole lot of style, a whole lot of grace

Why when I'm starvin I got to gobble meals
Why did I cop to steal
Why did I ride ride for real
Why we can't wait til our time God could take her
Why the flesh eatin disease make niggas get ate her
Why bitches with a fat ass gotta wear A cup
Why Dave Listern from the NBA-a
Why the great ones always break up
And when travisty happen they wanna make up
Why niggas can't get caked up and stay caked up
Say what why we can't tell who's smart or dumb
Why niggas in blue suits gotta take us and put us in orange one
Why Adam and Eve didn't know what was in the garden dun
Why niggas from America always wanna cart to foreign land
My drugs I gotta buy why sluts gotta fly why thugs gotta cry
Why when I get on blood got to die
Why me and Tai can't see eye to eye
Why when plane crashes niggas fly to die
Why were depend on a handshake when you reachin a palm
Why beef with my mom why can't sleep when I cum
Why my black I love every fight I laugh when they mug me every right
I got to fuck every night
Run deep in my ways six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain't retreated to slaves
Why we don't learn til we leave for the cage
And we say the beasts is in rage
Why I can't tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Whys no such thing as true lies
Why can't I have two rather than few highs
Whys homos got to do guys in the world
Why ain't there more girls that wanna do girls
Whys multiple-sclorosis why got multiple intosis
You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight flurges I see crook type murders
And niggas get cooked like burgers
Why your girl want my clique why your girl on my dick
Why she rub it against her mouth like it's chap stick
Why this rap shit
Why CEOs wanna rap why rappers wanna be CEOs
Yo why you all wanna see me blow
Why the rederick why I can't get my proper etiquette

[Outro]
Better get all your money motherfucker get that said again
I want that money too nigga
Fuck that lil two dollar prude
I wanna get that Cristal shit too nigga
Yeah niggas up in the shit motherfucker
I ain't stoppin I ain't never fuckin stoppin
