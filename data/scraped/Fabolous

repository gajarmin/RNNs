[Skit]
Well in just about 15 seconds from now, it'll be 1990. We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989. The ball is moving, the crowd sees it, you can hear 'em. Oh, can you ever hear 'em. They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990; goodbye to the 80's. (10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Happy new year!

[Intro: Fabolous & (French Montana)]
Whoa, whoa, whoa (x7)
(Haan, change is good for everybody)
Montana, Dre fitted it, haan)

[Bridge: French Montana]
When that hate don't work they start telling lies
Baby work, go on bust it wide
It's that new money, let the drawers drop
I cut my bitch off when the ball drop

[Refrain: Fabolous & French Montana]
Haan
(Whoa whoa whoa) (x4)
I just don't know why

[Hook: Fabolous & French Montana]
Hating hoes ain't happy
And happy hoes ain't hatin'
Better check the situation
I could fix your situation
Whoa whoa whoa (x2)
I cut them bitches off when the ball drop
New year, new money, then the call dropped
(New year, new money, let them drawers drop)
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Cause them real niggas ain't haters
And them hatin' niggas ain't real
And baby I could help your situation
No top, smokin' medication

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
This the new year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'
I told em get money, that's the best solution
When you do, wear your rocket like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style, I ain't stress the boostin'
It's time to make more money, less excuses
My old bitch on death row, it's time for execution
My new bitch is bad ass, she the best since Boosie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
12 o' clock then the call dropped
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Young boy, hard head in the soft top
Cause when them shots ain't ringin' ,you can't call shots
Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the next Mike Brown where you rollin' at
V with hundred on the Lincoln
3 quarter mink blew the top off Lincoln, God
Niggas scared to play it like jail or Richard Mellor
I hope I never Tom Heller, God
Scramble like a dope fiend (dope fiend)
Keep your head up like your nose bleedin'
My right hand got 30 on his left arm
On that left lane nigga, what a bitch for?
I just don't know why

[Bridge] + [Refrain] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop
Ridin' with my woes til' the casket drop
Quiet 'fore you suckas hear a pin drop
I buy this mother fucker like the price drop
Shawty bag it up, let that ass drop
Mommy killin' em, tat tear drop
Bitch I'm on fire, need to stop drop
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped
Heard he was a rat, heard he dime dropped
Hit em in the head, watch the body drop
Dollars coming down like rain drops
New year, new money, nigga ball drop

[Hook][Hook: Chris Brown]
Ooh she wildin', wildin'
She do her thang,  thang (x4)
She just wanna shake something
Girl that ass gon' make money
Ooh she wildin', wildin'
She do her thang,  thang
Said she like it rough, beat that pussy up
You ain't never fuck a thug
You gon' fall in love
A bottle of that liquid courage on the way now
All my ladies taking shots, I know that they down

[Verse 1: Fabolous]..
I said ooh, she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang
Lames get shot down, she do a bang bang
She attract rappers and the ones who do the same thang
Playas in the league and dope boys who slang thangs
All tryna pull up on her, all she do is lane change
They be all in the air, wanting her to be the main thing
Tryna lock her down, she ain't with the Chain Gang
Wanna make her wifey, but no name change
She be on that Birkin to Chanel type of name change
She be stuntin', she be on her Jackie Chan thang
Big chain Rollie in the sky, let your thang swang
Might wear the iced out, might plain Jane,
Either way you know what time it is, gotta maintain
Mr. Chow's girl, not a P.F. Chang thang
Whole crew bad, it's a pretty gang thang
Long hair, don't care, let it hang thang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I said ooh, she pop a Molly and do her thang thang
Take the grapefruit and do that brain thang
Man, that ruby red, that shit done changed things
I'm about to bust, but before I go bang bang
Hold up, she climb up on it like she King Kong
Back and forth on that table, like she ping pong
She tell me play the dirty version, not the clean song
She tell me fuck her in the dark, with my bling on
And she do this thing to me, she know I like
She need no one to check, she know that mic
She like when Spider-Man climb up them walls
She be so wet, feel like you in The Falls
She like Niagara, man fuck your Viagra
She make you cum fast and fuck up your swagger
She make you come back, like that boomerrang
Ooh she be wildin' when she do her thang
When she do her thang
When she do her thang
When she do her thang
Ooh she be wildin', when she do her thang

She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big Zoo Wap from the bando, without dinero can't go
Remy boys got the stamp, though
Count up hella, them bands though

Uh huh, Uh huh we like it
Yea Kid mobbin' with the gods
You don't want no problem with the gods

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look I talk it cause I live it, stand on my own pivot
I don't need your credit, and you ain't got it to give it
All I do is fill up banks, Aunt Viv it
Drink Belaire Champane and Club Liv it
I come from the era where you really had to live it
Couldn't say you Bentley, you're really a Honda Civic
Every thing you said painted pictures so vivid
So when I talk clippers, know that I can Doc Riv it (swish)
Big man, pace your self like Roy Hibbert
You feel froggy than leap, stop all the ribbits
I pop up at your crib and cats lookin' like Xzibit
Box braids and mean mugs, I mean thugs
Type you would merge with on some purge shit
Put in 'work' ASAP, on some Ferg shit
My homies said "niggas just tryna wave surf you
Tryna jump aboard the wave you gave birth through"
All these niggas late and want me to waive curfew
Talkin' like they shooters when they wouldn't spray perfume
They know who the hell I be, I'm L-I-T
I pass one to French like "c'est la vie"
Ju L-I-E, stay off the L-I-E
The 2 Chains made a single no L-I-E (Truu)
I mean I don't care what her man says
He better come 'airing' like Hernadez
Or you gon' hear that 'Braat' like Birdman says
Leave him hanging out his helmet, Richard Sherman Dreads
See, I hit shorty like I need that bouquet
Her man hit me back like "you need some WHO cake?"
I text him right back like "you heard that new Drake?
You know that if you reading this it's too late"
See you ain't offending me
It ain't like you ain't heard son is fly as Kennedy (JFK)
Riding in the six, got a lot of enemies
A lot of people tryna drain me of the energy
I know how it be, you know me from Brevoort
Used to call me "Sport", now it's Resorts
Boats and  sea ports, foreign v's bought
Stamps and p-port, bunch of bitches in them Ms. Parker jean shorts
Mami got some head that'll stop a deport
Throat game have me stuck, call it deep thought
But watch where you kick it
You park in the wrong spot, you know you'll get a ticket
All of that tough talk, and now the shit is crickets
Be alot of places where these niggas can't visit
They think yo mans missin'

["I been around" hook chant]

[Fabolous ranting]
I been around the world nigga..
I been around your girl too
Stop callin my muthafuckin phone talkin bout who this?
Deez NUTS! GOT 'EM! Hahahaa... GOT 'EM!

[DJ Clue ranting]
We ain't done yet
Ya'll niggas is sleeping at the wheel
We on auto pilot[Chris Brown]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothing but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Chuckin up them (deuces)
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
I know you're mad, but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Drake]
What you mean I ain’t call you? I hit you when I landed
I’m waiting in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguing more and it’s getting less romantic
Yeah, I think she’ll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I’ll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still
I might just put up with the arguing and stay, for real
You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I’m willing to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us
Our timing is wrong
Your friends always tying up every line on your phone
Yeah but tell them bitches that you’ll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own
And every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired then I break you off
It’s useless all this fighting let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten; ice cold like Michigan
Look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening
Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killing me, but soon its gon' be killing you
To see her in that two seater, now that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me
By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind, again, again. and deuces I must throw ya peace

[Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right baby or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I’mma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch
I’m stupid but I won’t get my drama on
What I’m dealing with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who” I don’t know who you talking 'bout

[Fabolous]
According to my old bitch I be on some new shit
She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch
Think I give two shits? you ain't gonna do shit
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better you’d do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Chris Brown]
So you gonna diss me even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gonna

[Drake]
(miss me a little when I’m gone)

Drizzy voice, now I’m ghost baby
Four door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I’m bout my business boys, plus I make paper
Come on that's old news, yesterday’s paper
Oh, you talking, what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut ya mouth
You’ll never score another me, I’ll shut it out
Act like there’s gum in your hair girl, cut it out

[Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds
She the only one is missing
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it
Got a racing Lamborghini have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talking ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in the hall of fame
I let my denim sag #red Louis belt
How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself

[Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor
I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousins house to see if I was there
Get ya minds out the gutter man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But shit they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop making sad songs

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more trying to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her; to her[Produced by Phonix Beats]

[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
We good, we good
Fab, R-H-Q

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
Been a couple years since a nigga got put on
Tell ya boy stop, he outta here, he gone
It ain't much that you can do that I can't do for me
I, I already got my team, I tell 'em
We good, we good, we good, we good
All of my niggas from the hood I tell 'em
We good, we good, we good, we good
We good, we good, we good

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
You wasn't there when we needed your help so we good
They wouldn't do it, I did it myself now we good
Sorry my nigga can't buy what you selling, we good
I heard that my ex asking 'bout me, just tell her we good
Pouring some D'usse inside of my cup & some OJ inside of B Wood
Blowing on hookah, some good girls is here but I swear they not here to be good
That boy from Brooklyn they want what he cooking they heard that his recipe good
Horoscope say that we bad for each other, but the sex‘ll be good
Get with the Scorpio, I’m getting more Fritos
They getting chips, but I’m getting Doritos
'Bout to get more Cheetos
I get you wet have you bustin' it like torpedoes
You came three times you trying to four-peat though?
She said "We good nigga you try to kill me?"
"I’m trying to make sure you good, do you feel me?"
Now call that nigga and tell him you good
When he said come over tell him you would
But see the way that my shit is set up
You in the bed & you cannot get up
Focus on you homie, get your bread up
Things will get easier, keep your head up
She with the gang now she throw the set up
And she fuckin' me good and she make the bed up
So we good, we good

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
We good on you niggas
Don’t got to wish cause we would on you niggas
Back in the day we was good little niggas
Ya’ll must of thought that we wouldn't get bigger
Ya’ll must of thought that we wouldn't get money
Heh, shit we a good 7 figures
Give us a shot & we pulling the trigger
And pull up on niggas like skurttt, pull up with bitches like her
Full of chinchilla the fur, bulletproof everything sir
You know them haters be trying to take shots
They on the bench & they trying to take spots
Them niggas ice cold that you trying to make hot
Them bitches ain't real, when you find 'em they thots
The feeling, we good on that fake shit
We out here trying to stay far from it
We know 'bout the bottom, we all from it
We in the hood but you borrow from it
Did it my way not like y’all done it
Then I just wait and lacoste them
I did it flyer while ya'll bumming, this shit ain't hard for me
Too many flavors to do on these haters
But do me a favor don’t do me no favors
We good, we good

[Hook][Verse 1: Fabolous]
Sometimes I like slim, sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine them and I like thim slick
Thim slick probably went over your head
Couldn't lay up, I just went over for head
Made a change of plans when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony pint over the ledge
Been a few days, but I sent over some bread
It can get rough with tuition and rent over your head
Not to save hoes or rescue anybody
But a nigga know what stress do to the body
And I done seen you in your best shoes but Zanotti's
Shit be looking like fresh shoes on Bugatti's
And I don't know who invented high heels
But I swear we all owe him one
And if you do know that man, girl
I be like ''where you know him from?''
You so slick, so small, curvy
Teeth all pearly, hair all curly
Was a Tom Boy, now you all girly
Never look tired, but you wake up all early
Hit the gym, keep it toned up
Progress pic, holding your phone up
Aw shit, waist getting smaller
Niggas on Instagram like ''damn, I need to call her''

[Hook: Jeremih](Fabolous)
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just fine
You get that blessing in disguise
You wouldn't know it, girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
She like ''hold up, let me throw on something light'' (damn)
Bitch really went and threw on something tight (haha)
Came downstairs in her Superwoman tights like
''Dida dida, dida dida dida''
Damn, I ain't know you was holding like that
I ain't know brown skin Kelly Rowland like that
Never knew you had it with your sneaky ass
She said ''I never seen you looking with your peaking ass''
34, 24, 36
Finally got a selfie after taking thirty pics
36, 24, 40
D-cups; caption, double cup shorty
And it's angles to this shit, angles to this shit
Gotta hold her phone up and put the angle on the pics
And then they poke it out and put an angle on that hip
Having thirsty niggas come from every angle at that bitch
Lord, Heard when they thinner you get deeper in her
They say when they thicker they make you cum quicker
(Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime)
That ass in the gym; squat life
Gotta show 'em love in the era of the shot life
This is all from my mama, this is not knife
Niggas love her shit, give a fuck about likes

[Hook][Verse 1: Ace Hood]
No one on the corner has swagger like this
Cause I'm so incredible they not compatible to me
Eat 'em up like I was cannibal, the cattle to a beast
Graduated from the hunger now it's rappers that I feast
And I'm coming for each and everyone of you that said I couldn't do
Now I'm swergity swagging on you bums doin' this interview
Call it an interlude, talking to you inner fools
Got nominated, I know they hate it, they sick of dude
But if you sick of new, I feed the lamers Theraflu
Get em man and buy a coupe and drop the roof
Adjust the cruise, show them what the swagger do
It's on the highest altitude
They can't fit my sneaker shoes, the best rapper attitude
See the younging in the zone
The beaches, see the features on my faces I can't erase because my swagger so amazing homles
Catch me at the top
I'm throwing Big J and hot metal
Balling like I'm Karl Malone
The next best is on!

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
There's only two men I fear when it comes to a battle:
God and my shadow
Everybody else get a ravelled, tangled, mangled, totally disabled
Hung from a roof watch 'em dangle
Then I make his wife feel the pain too: anal
Juelz Santana, forget those busters
The boy flows harder than Kimbo's punches
You boys betta step aside, before I get at guys
You just bugs I'm spittin' that pesticide
Your not mobsters, wait stop the fake, or get found dead with your head in that pasta plate
Money in the bank I benefit from my benefits
I'm making it while I'm spending it
You go to the Louie store, you go to the Gucci store
You go to the mall spend it all what you do that for
You could buy the rags, you could buy the bags
But there ain't no sign that say they sell swag
But you could watch me and do your best imitation
You need a little time, a little preparation
But sooner or later your gonna have to face it
I like a pent house, your a fixed up basement
As far a chicks go I get it you take it
I give 'em all Franks, they call me Nathan's

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Lyrically it don't matter, up-and-comer or a has be
I'm in your ass B who’s the next Raz-B
Wordplay king I'm not the one to Scrabble with
The rocks got more carats in it than rabbit shit
And after these ill lines, you might see why I need a deal sign
Cause everybody coming in this year is failing
Ask why and they just play Sarah Palin
I'd rather be in Maui para sailing
Cause when you in the lead you don't care who’s trailing
So get your little money you isn’t a threat
When we was making it rain you wasn’t drizzling yet
Right Meech? Death before dishonor
Their swaggers like mine cause I left it on the corner
So fly I gotta shop at the Sky mall
And this summer we getting more drops than eyeballs
Loso!

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
I told you this once Hip Hop is not dead
Change gon' come, just like Barack said
"Money, Power, Respect" like The Lox said
"You'll be the man of the house", my paps said
Heat the streets up, right quick it's all timing
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
You could know so much yet but no nothing
If I don't know nothing else, bet I know hustling
This ain't even a rhyme, it's a controlled substance
Strictly iron swinging, no tussling
I just do business I don't do friends
Brand new M1's and 9mm's
As long as money's involved with it I'm in
You ain't gotta second guess the best, I'm him
I would rap circles around these new urkels
Everything is digital, pills are still purple
So I'm staying in my lane 'til it opens up
I'm like a sponge in the game just soaking up
Before I'm gone I deserve a hit
I know you heard of Kiss
This is the cypher, I murdered it![Hook: French Montana]
Money ain't everything nigga it's the only thing
I pop bottles like I got 40 rings
40 cars, 40 chains, 40 bitches
I got 40 names
A, K, K, K, K, K
Karma, drama, never been to college
Think about the feds homie, that'll be the only thing
40 cars, 40 chains

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Bust, bust it, what the business is?
Cars, cribs, couple businesses
Lean, Percs and them blacks
Been to hell and back
Then I cut off my rearview, cause I ain't looking back
Now my bad bitch neck tatted, blue dye my bladder
Rip it off that rack boy, what it cost don't matter
I say starin' down and I'm in it
Trap money I'm spending
PG for that dream team, you fucking right we winning
40, 40, another 40 boy
They ask me why I sell, feel that YSL?
Drunk in the front, your bitch in the back
I land in the front, and I start from the back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Hop out the jet, what city is this?
3 bitches in bed, I'm like who's titty is this?
They fucked around and let a nigga like me get rich
I don't know another nigga like me exist
These girls be 'bout that YOLO life
I ask you now if you a ho, no right?
But my dick's still meeting with your throat tonight
Pimp game strong, cold as ice
Told em I'd show you right
You pay for pussy, you know the price
That's hard to handle, this life a gamble
I want the dice, minute rice
To business life, I'm an enterprise
And I'll drop whatever on whatever you ain't finna buy
Live every moment like my last, like I'm finna die
Know I sing it now wonder will I sing it when I'm in the sky

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabulous]
Bust it, bust it, she let that 40 flame
My AKA is what shorty name
Just call my crew the Rolex and Audi gang
But we still got no time for these lames
I'm with my Mexican homies out of Juárez
They'll hook you up, give you a chorus
We campaigning like we running for pres
Still watching out for JC and Torres
New York undercovers amongst the others
The family be couple hundred of us
Got a hundred brothers, AKA the Jacksons
Got a hundred sisters, AKA the Braxtons

[Hook][Intro: Cassidy]
Yeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the Hustler
And I brought two of my niggas with me
And we about to shut the industry down
Aiyyo Wheezy let's get it poppin!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hit me,  Fuck that shit this the south side
Got a fat dick when your mouth wide, I'm from the take it outside
Nah do it right here, nah, how 'bout later on
Yeah when everybody home
Look, you fucking with Weezy F baby, please say the baby
Riding with your bitch, got keys on the lady
Triple gold D's Vogue tires on the whip
Young Carter sliding out, I'm flyer than the whip
Yeah, higher than an angel, or hotter than the devil
The pot or kettle, uh
The metal let 'em burn like "Usher" but worser
If there's any beef, I come Ron like Mercer
Word up, eagle street I'm throwing my curve up
We take your ice cream and turn you into Sherbert
I got flow I'm like "Sure" but
If it's about dough, I'm like "Sure 'nuff"
I'm from the bird bunch, Birdman Jr. you niggas bird lunch
I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much
You see the wrist moving, it look like pure punch
I hear the playa hating but I don't endorse such
I got the Escalade, guts like the tour bus
I got the styrofoam poured up with syrup
And in the tires where the package is gone
Midas been a Goodyear with these Firestones
I spit like Maya's poems, palming chromers
For the buyers chromosomes I got soma's
I got vicodins, valiums I ain't stopping
Got powder, heroin, ex, oxycontin
And that's how we rocking
How can you hear that bop unless I'm be-bopping?
Yeah skip when you hear that click
Cash money, nigga, I'm that shit
Weezy Baby

[Interlude: Cassidy]
That's what I'm talking about
Now Fab, spit at these niggas
And let them know why they ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You're goddamn right I'm feeling myself
A chauffeur, no sir, I'm wheeling myself
Looking for a chick chilling for self
So I can show her the suicides and talk her into killing herself
I'm having problems dealing with wealth
But you wouldn't understand it, until you get a million yourself
You niggas must've got a deal for your health
Your CD is frozen food, it just chills on the shelf
I spend big, at any time I can start splurging
The twin SIGs open chests like a heart surgeon
And I'm buttoned up, I'm just a blue-collar crook
But I keep a stack thick as few college books
I got a new polished look
And 20 dime bitches, to show y'all niggas how my 2 dollars look
The boy's got at least 6 digits on
So the guns gotta be at least midget long
The money, is like 10 bridges long
I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on
I got some good smoke just for puffers
The 2 grand 20's make the hustlers suffer
Plus it's fluffer, than a cotton ball
I've gotten calls wanting me to put the pot in malls
But nowadays you can't put it past 'em
I got a Dan Marino arm, I'm bout to throw some bullets past 'em
And the niggas in the hood keep quoting my lines
I don't jump ship, I keep floating in mine
Long as I keep toting, I'm fine
I'ma have these dick sucking niggas deep-throating the 9
I jumped in the English ship, Benzed whip
It's Terminator 2 chrome the engines dip
I'm reading scripts, no, not the penmanship
The box-office shit, a box off this bitch
Jessica Alba, Kirsten Dunst
And still make a mil' on the first of months
These dudes be the first to front
'Til their family and friends is in limos, they in hearse in front
I'm in the top position, I can make you a proposition
I'm in the hard top waiting on the drop edition
To hell with the patience
I'ma send a nigga down under like Australia vacations

[Cassidy: Interlude]
Yeah it is what it is
My niggas just killed y'all and I'mma close the casket

[Verse 3: Cassidy]
I'm tryin' not to let this industry get the best of me, y'all
I work hard for the fame, the game's stressing me y'all
All they do is complain what they expect from me y'all
From the hood to Hollywood, they're respecting me y'all
And even overseas, they're accepting me y'all
All the ladies show me love, the thugs repping me y'all
I get a lot of dirty money, so expect me to ball
But I'm saving all my checks, I'm investing 'em all
They say, what goes up is gon' definitely fall
Even the stars, but success is my destiny, y'all
Look, I cook tracks I got the recipe, y'all
You can't name another cat that can mess with me, y'all
At the shows all the hoes be molesting me, y'all
I got broads crying trying to get next to me, y'all
I got broads craving begging to have sex with me, y'all
Screaming, "Cass you don't know how sexy you are!"
And I'm happy I'm alive, God's blessing me y'all
And all the problems that arrive is God testing me y'all
So I pray everyday, but I ain't praying too much
Cause I be sinning everyday, so I ain't praying enough
And we all could be beat, and I ain't saying I'm tough
But if it's beef I don't speak, I ain't saying "What's up"
If it's beef when we meet then I'm spraying shit up
Prraat prraat. I ain't saying too much and that's that
Cause that cat you embracing with love
Might clap that gat cause he got hate in his blood
Keep your friends at a distance and your enemies close
Cause the folks you call friends tend to envy the most
Some cats'll hang themselves if you give 'em a rope
Burn the bridge and don't give a boat, let 'em sink
Sometimes you gotta give 'em some some time to let 'em think
But sometimes you gotta give 'em the 9 and let 'em stink
You can't bring every horse to the pond and let 'em drink
I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink
As soon as your eyes shut, them niggas will ride up
And the guys that you trusted be getting you tied up
And we all gotta die but, I ain't ready to leave
That's why, even if it's petty, I'll be ready to squeeze
But put a cheddar in cheese, the guac-a-moola
I pop the Ruger, send that hot shit through ya
Like booya, that's the sound when the pound busting
Ooh, ah, you'll be laying on the ground suffering
Clowning's nothing to pull out and blast you
I try to only resort to violence if I have to
But, man, niggas out here are playing fair
So before the odds even I'm leaving them laying there
And I ain't even playing, believe what I'm saying here
Cause before this shit gets further your click gets murdered
And found in a hole in the grass
For trying to play that thug role I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass
And this Cass, nigga, I'm that sick
Full Surface nigga, I'm that shit
Bitch[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
Ay yo, it's DJ Kay Slay, the drama king
So this is what it comes down to, huh?
Y'all niggas think y'all 'bout that life?
Well it's time to show and prove
Fab, set it off!

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look, I terminate a bitch, like her name was Sarah Connor
Where I'm from, we never meet daddies; swear on mommas
I'm high fashion, so my Gucci reeks of marijuana
My shoes are killing them! I call these a pair of homi-cides
Put me in the passenger and I'mma ride, cause my mind is full of massacres
Killer verses, I lay 'em down and fill up hearses
You can't be the best without knowing who the worst is
Me and Kay a lot alike, we don't fake nothing
Thick bitches in my sheets, I be straight stunting
You got the wrong keys, I ain't who to start with
Rise of the apes, now who you monkeys getting smart with?

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fetty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team and you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
I-I-I'm go-going hard, go-going in
Tryna get what I can get before these people give me 25 to life
Now tell them hatin' ass niggas, that hatin' only makes you die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
In love with the money, infatuated with coupes
Immaculate living, money stack up to my roof
The baddest of women, purse matchin' the boots
That's the half, you don't wanna see what's in that fuckin' bag
Pull it like a flip cam, first you aim it, then you fire
Penthouse smoker, nigga, I can't get no higher
Hella bad heroine in every bag she carry "O."
You niggas ain't getting money, fuck it and carry on
The biggest and the richest, fucking self made
Ricky Rozay and my nigga Kay Slay
Pound of purple green, 2 liter of pink Sprite.
I could flip a brick before a chick can blink twice!

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Nelly]
You know what? You don't like me, I don't give a fuck
Respect is like some money to me, I don't get enough!
Like I ain't put on the hardest city in America
St. Louis, and we ain't scared of ya
King of the drama, see him rollin' with the drama king
Yo Kay Slay, you want lil' momma from your magazine?
You know the one that's got a body like a cartoon
Ass like a whale 'til lil' durrty gotta harpoon
Woo! This stacking racks on racks
Go check my hallways mother fucker, plaques on plaques
These niggas lying a lot, I'm speaking facts on facts
My hotel room's infested durrty, rats on rats

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Looking at a dollar bill, saw the White House
Then I flipped a couple bills, bought a white house
Triple beam on a triple stack, triple back
Going back court like I dribbled back, simple fact
When that drop roller and that top fold up
Bitches going both ways like they're bipolar
Pop the ace Black Jack, ski mask, black mac
Hit the back of your head, turn your fitted to a snapback
Best of the greatest, bought the pussy and paid for maintenance
Waste of money, wack head, the bitch brainless
Word to Kay Slay, you niggas straight stuntin'
I be spending seven digits like it ain't nothin'

[Hook: T-Pain][VERSE 1: RYAN LESLIE]
You've got fashion and style
I'm lovin' your smile and
The way you get down
I can't see no one else
It's you by yourself, yea
In spite of the crowd
(Baby no one else matters)

You're my addiction[Lead in: Fabolous]
Ay yo, sit back relax, sip ya Cognac, young insomniac
Cause you sleep the 'hood will wash you like a laundromat
Sneak attack and trap from cats who pop collar
In fact your dog will be on a shirt like a Rottweiler

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Some say I'm funny style, I say I'm "getting money style"
Niggas get shot every day, shit ain't even funny now
The streets is hungry, I remember how my tummy growled
I was just a bummy child, now they see me come in Childs
Made a mill, my life is looking yummy now
Learned from being broke don't get rich and be a dummy now
Cause rap niggas turning mummy now
Hosting all black parties, eyes teary, nose runny now
So warn your brothers, yeah them carats cost a hundred thou
But when it's over, that's all folks, Bugs Bunny style
Ain't see it before, my eyes is 20/20 now
Used to keep it a hunnid, them niggas funny money now
So I got the two-seater, keep your honey from me now
Paint white, seats tan, shit look honey bunny now
Yeah, shout out to homies on the Ave still
There's no Love in the game, that's how the Cavs feel

[Verse 2: Paul Cain]
Yo my mind's hard-wired for crime, career crook
From the cradle that's just how I'm designed
Certified street king, I'm the last of my kind
For how he lived, not for the way that he died, is how a man is defined
These new niggas, quick to shoot without looking, blind fury
All pussy, when the wolfpack loose they hide jury
They hide when I fly by, high in that 5 Series
Don't care how cool you think they is, don't bring them guys near me
Never trust a soul, fuck what the 'hood think
First they took Stack from us, then they took Chinx
Survival of the fit, the hunger is real
My city is like a concrete jungle for real
Kill or be killed in my mindset since I was twelve
Getting money, eating good with my people and live well
If I don't find heaven on Earth, I raise hell
You see hellfire, escape from the barrel, I blaze shells
To this day I ask my man, "How the fuck we escape cells"?
The few who understand me, they come from the same hell
This shit I say is shocking, you stepped on a third rail
You gotta feel me to know what I'm saying -- Cain braille

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
See I normally leave the classics alone
Normally no B&E's without a map of the home
Formally, I don't compare, all these rappers is clones
You ever sat on the throne, spattering poems, I massacre homes
But these new niggas beef different, they just send a sub at em
Me, I'm still tinting the hoop, cocking the snub at em
Niggas don't fuck wit 'em, I don't give a fuck again
LeBron-inspired, musta thought I needed Love to win
Smoke and mirrors, gotta be an illusion
You never see me disputing, I delete the confusion
I scoop my nigga in that two-seater, we moving
Soon as he extend an arm, we gon' reach a conclusion
You niggas never felt that pain, it's like torture
When the shooter never come in for Teague (fatigue), like Korver
Nigga whole existence is to take them pies off ya
When you see him you might often know that niggas might off ya[Hook: Jeremih]
Ahh shit, ahh shit, ahh shit
Nigga feeling good, she did
Dammit I should, alright
Now It's finna blow, green lights
And this is how it goes

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Yolo, yo ho, on that, fo sho
Bet that shawty wet, I’m rocking her robo
Heard she like it going deep
May I take her photo
No referees up in the ring
Yeah I prefer them low blows
Her shit pop, paw paw, fo fo
I cuff her ass I’m no cop, but she call me robo
Never had a four loco, never had a 4 loco
But when they po' me up a fo' I'm leaning like a cholo
Gone yeah, gone yeah, even on my own man
You kid, i’ma type of grown man
You rent, i’ma type of own man
Your girlfriend up on me, swear he don’t know me
Now I’m all in her shit, now like roman
Now tell me how many licks does it take to
Break her, put her to sleep and bout time now she wake up
I’m fresh of a flight from the heat to the lakers
And still on a high off these trees from jamaica

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Digest, I just, live in that projects
Now I’m in that penthouse, salute my progress
Respect that process, admire my guess
Fuck being modest, nigga admire my goddess
Cause she bad, that’s obvious
She thick, that body is
Probably is, hot as Abu Dubai is
And it’s going down like
Elevators to where the lobby is
Into 9 I’m on that brown like bobby is
It’s my prerogative, I can show you how to live
Every little step you take will be in shoes Guiseppe makes
My tender roni, the one and only
Fuck me two times in case the first one get lonely
Ahhh shit, now we fucking talking
Oh is we talking fucking, but what you suckers talking?
I keep buying rides, like I suck at walking
The motto's money talk, I said what you suckers talking huhh?

[Hook][Intro: DJ Clue]
Yeah, live from the 718, the World Famous DJ Clue
Desert Storm, that boy Fabolous
Friday Night Freestyles
You know how we get down
Stupid

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, two things fam I ain't nuthin' ta fuck wit'
My crew ain't playing and we ain't for the fuck shit
I'm ridin' wit whoever that I hop out the truck wit'
Slidin' with the sticks on some slap-in-the-puck shit
No hockey, just riders, no jockey
Chinese food, less beef, more broccoli
My fortune cookie said stay humble, flow cocky
Call the jeweler A$AP, time to go Rocky
My chain glisten, bright enough to change vision
Shortie see I'm everything that these lames isn't
Told you I could take your bitch, you ain't listen
I heard the friend zone feel like you in Bane prison
Fly little joint, her weave just hang different
Bought her that Malaysia, she went plane missin'
I put her in that fast lane no more lane switchin'
Told her keep curvin' them niggas don't change pitches
Benchriders, comin' in the game dissin'
Fame fishin', tryna-get-a-name mission
My team gon rush you niggas, we came blitzin'
My boy got that AK wit' him he came swizzin'
I bang vixens, main chicks and game kicks in
Hit it and fall back on em, game sixin'
Keep them broke bitches away, we ain't fixin'
You chasin' baby? I'm straight, ain't mixin'!
Dusse straight up, cause dues say paid up
It's go time Rugs, fuck who say wait up
You in ATL, then my crew may skate up
Like T.I. flick, handle B.I. quick
All my niggas bring em home, R.B.I. chicks
All you niggas talk to the FBI Quick, rats
Sprinter full of Splinters
I was gettin paper like a printer through the winter
Weather break I might get the Bent or the Aventa-
Dor, more, adventures of a center
Big nigga ballin', big figures callin'
She hooked on me, she a big-dick-a-holic
Tryna stay above water that's just some duck shit
Tryna stash a hundred mil, keep it a buck shit
We stay winnin' baby this ain't no luck shit
Rest of these niggas ain't nothin' to fuck wit

Oh yeah![Intro: Rick Ross]
Boss is my position, I got the ammunition
All Wale talking is Ambition

[Hook: Rick Ross (Wale)]
In the caravan with some Latin bitches
Talking caramel with them asses like the strippers
Oye mami, ven aca, come her for papi chulo
Let me knock it out the park, I'm talking Albert Pujols
(Albert Pujols, trial left two hoes up in my new muh-fucking two door
This shit ain't nothing new though
I'm tryna knock that out the park, Albert Pujols)

[Vamp]
Schematic, hold the fuck up nigga
Bring that shit the fuck back
This the big boss Ricky Ross nigga
We ain't playing no fucking games

[Verse 1: Wale]
Made a million with the pen
Make my women follow dreams, pussy popping follow head
Bitches check on my stats, women get too attached
Fuck what them niggas saying I hit whoever at bat
John Rocker Atlanta's Bravest know that I'm awesome
Bet I be like Fenway out in Boston, my green is a monster
We don't speak to informants, they just look for a way out
They just hating on the game, they just way too Canseco
Gotta thank my crew, my label, everything I do they ate, Oh
K with, who the fuck gon' say something?
Shit grand like a muh-fucking bass load
Three strikes put a muh-fucking K up
Double M nigga now we up
Three strikes like a muh-fucking C.C
You wife ain't shit, we G'd her
Huh, we G'd up, G'd up
Up in my new two door
Knock it out the park, Albert Pujols

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Feel like I seen it all, but I can't say so
Be a snitch? No way, Jose Canseco
Face down, ass up, ain't none of my bitches planking though
We got stripes in my city, ain't none of my niggas Yankees though
It's going down in history, the way I valet two doors
She blew a kiss at me, I told her da le culo
Listen b, just give my stylist kudos
And my consistency? I call that Albert Pujols
Shouts out to St. Louey, swag champ I got the belt
Big H if it ain't Louie, cuffing you bitch is not gon' help
They asking me what I wear, I think YSL is how it spelt
And I might just let you touch it if you don't go tell 'em how I felt
Real nigga, that's just how I'm built
From turning white into cream, powdered milk
To getting rich off a dream, I throw it the bag
This the Ambition anthem, I flowed it to the flag

[Hook][Verse 1]
When you think of me, you think of the nicest
My slow flow's a modern-day crisis, these freestyles are priceless
All you gon' hear is God damns and Jesus Christes
While these 90s beats become religious sacrifices
Rap game's ISIS, studio terrorism
Lira Galore came through, helped me with the lyricism
These is hard bars, type you only hear in prison
Swag rap got you blind, this shit'll clear your vision
Grass cut low, so you can catch em' being snake
Cause everybody real 'til you catch 'em bein' fake
And I write my mean shit when I'm in a nice mood
And Friday's ain't been this good since Ice Cube's
See, behind every nice dude is a monster
They say behind every bad bitch is a sponsor
Just remember that this time could be your last time
That's why I'm out here rappin' like it's my last rhyme
So, stop complaining and get in your swag
In other words, get out your feelings and get in your bag
My nigga, your biggest problem is you care too much
And you always around, you be there too much
And it's, Fuck what you heard cause you hear too much
You just a lookin'-ass nigga and you stare too much
And over here we don't care for such
It's so real, shorty still hop in and be like, Here's your dutch
And now we rollin', blowin' Cali in the whip, stylin'
She actin' like it's a molly and her shit smilin'
She ain't listen, she probably in the whip wildin'
Suckin' like it's the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge
Uh, play-off game on the seventy-inch
And I'm the type of player that never get benched
Bitches wanna hang you, never the lynch
I'm tryin' to live this dream and never get pinched
Just somethin' 'bout my shit, I got it figured out
Bitch, I don't need your number, I'm seven-figured out
Nowadays, it looks like talk is all these niggas 'bout
Seems like the smallest pockets always have the biggest mouth
And being broke is a joke, I know I shouldn't laugh
That's why I come for everything they said I couldn't have
Before I go, only thing I want to mention is...
Money ain't the root of all evil now, attention is

[Hook]
Chillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million
While all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings
Next few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'
All for the love and keep killin', yeah

Chillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million
While all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings
Next few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'
All for the love and keep killin', yeah[Sample: Biggie]
"Yeah, this album is dedicated, to all the teachers who told me
I'd never amount to nothing
For all the people who lived above the buildings
That I was hustling from, that called the police on me
It's all good, baby baby
Cause I went from the negative to the positive
And it's all"

[Hook: Fabolous]
Good times like J.J. and them
It was G.O.O.D Music like Kanye and them
It was Goodfellas like Henry and them
But nowadays good girls, there's not too many of them
So if you a good girl, let me see your hands
Let these niggas know, every chance that you can
If you got that good good
Shorty, please raise your hand
You know its all good, you just need a good man
If you smokin' good-good, nigga pass it to your man
Cause when you at your lowest gettin' higher is the plan
Got somethin' in my cup, feel good to be the man
And if its good money, tell em' to put it in my hand

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Talking good dudes, good vibes and some good food
Smokin' good with a playlist full of good grooves
You know the shit you like to hear, like good news
A couple Megan Goods came through, made the hood move
And slow motion for me, she be frontin' like
Why all this commotion for me
They talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it
But she single, cause they never show devotion for it
She ain't never act too good for a nigga
But she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas
She like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga
You do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
She went Cee-lo with my Goodie Mob
Yellin' that I fall better, life is a gamble
I was good luck for the betters
Take a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss nigga
Time is golden, like that Rollie on your wrist nigga
I hate when they gets figures, then disfigured
And when niggas get salty and thinking that shits sugar
That's why good goes bad
That's when niggas who just came home, could go back
So let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good
Them boys would sit you down player, like a injury would
Then my niggas fuck with me, before the Industry would
Riding till the wheels fall off and the engine no good

[Hook][Hook: T-Pain]
All I do is win, win, win, no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
Whenever me and Khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
And they stay there
And they stay yea
And they stay there
Up, down, up, down, up, down
Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Verse 1: DJ Khaled]
Sittin' on the top floor, what you think I'm hot for
Every summer drop more, hits to make my stock go, up
Them hands go, up; them fans go, up
I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma, stay there
We the best of the best, grind while you haters just sleep
I'm yellin' "free Weezy", I rep the heart of the streets
Who hotter than me, I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist, wake up every morning just to count white faces
Neo in the Matrix, glorious as Morpheus
Employed all warriors, I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't [motherfuck ?] nobody better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)
(Kill 'em!)
Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again
Some niggas will be happy that I chose to rhyme with them cause

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Diddy]
Her heart racing like she snort cocaine
I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
Got the most paper Mr. New York Times
I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines
Everybody getting money but I cop the first six
Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest
Lean back you and your crew, Fat Joe, T-S
Yea it's Young Funeral, all black on me
So act like summers over and fall back homey
Winnin' is all I do, I'll answer all of you
But y'all ain't sayin' shit, like prank callers do

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
It's already proven, I got them birds movin'
All I do is win, I'm allergic to losin'
Yellow gold cuban, nine mil Ruger
I'll show you what to do with em
Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em
They don't want no problems, they might end up suing em
Disassociate yourself, have nothing to do with em
We already got a jet, we tryna get two of em

[Verse 8: Fat Joe]
Just blew trial, crack lobsters Little Italy
Your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down Joe, you killin' me
Beat her like a prize fight mommy I’m a rude boy
You just hit the Power Ball, everyday a new toy
Nigga it’s a stick up, a motherfuckin' robbery
I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me
Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

[Hook][Hook: Trey Songz]
I just want to make you right
In the past, we done both had others
Girl, I'm tired of the lonely nights
I just want to be your lover

Listen, I can't lie, I think I'm fallin' in love
Girl, I just want you, you, you, that's all I want
You, you, listen, I can't lie, I think I'm fallin' in love
Girl, I just want you, you, you, that's all I want
You, you, all I want

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Say my name, say my motherfuckin' name
My sex drive is doin' a fuckin' change
Red rover, red rover, ain't talkin' 'bout no rain
So, why don't you come over and just let me explain?
It's one o'clock in the mornin', still up and I'm yawnin'
Obvious that I'm tired, but I'm late up just dawnin'
On all the things that we been through, all the places we been to
I can't see myself wit' no one else other than you
My appetite continues, you're the main cause of my menu
Feel like I'm at that stage and you headlinin' my venue
You think I play by what I say, but I don't
If I know nothin' else, I know what I want, Trey, tell 'em what I want

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
My advice: make your next move your best move
Yeah, and use your ex-boo as your excuse
I'm moving like a king, yes, I'm just a chess dude
And protecting your queen, now, that's a good chess move
Cause king and queen, that's royalty, all I want is your loyalty
If it's wrong, you'll make it right, all I want is that warranty
Ain't even your birthday, but you could get a couple gifts from me
That black box say 'Chanel' on it, that blue box say 'Tiffany'
Tan box say 'Louis Vuitton', brown box say 'Louis Vuitton'
And you got them Js though, size six in them new LeBrons
You think I play by what I say, but I don't
If I know nothin' else, I know what I want, tell me what you want

[Hook]

[Outro: Fabolous]
Uh, I want is you now, all I want is you now
If you know what you want, let me hear you say, 'Oh'
And if you know what I want, let me hear you say, 'Oh'
You got to use what you got just to get what you want
Them hips give it away, I can see that shit from the front
Want to hold that, feel that, touch that really slow
Up, down, left, right, in, out, really though
Had some bad ones, even had fun all at once
That's temporary, check cemetery, that's dead, you all I want[Verse 1: Game]
You know I love you like cooked food, I’m a good dude
Let’s hit the Roscoe’s on Pico, I’m in a hood mood
I'm sittin’ here thinkin’ ‘bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin’ tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin’ Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you’re famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we’d grew into, whatever we into
That’s too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

[Hook: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I’m where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

[Verse 2: Lil’ Wayne]
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let’s be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don’t answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain’t got no room for her name but I’mma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said “I’m glad you ate it," where my cap & gown?
Told her “I can be your chauffeur,” dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, my girl’s sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
Indeed, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I’m looking down from Heaven screaming “Oh, Hell no!”
When you hop on top, girl, that’s what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain’t feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me ‘bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don’t fuck her on her period, ain’t into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
Cause she know me

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Outro: Fabolous]
I’m feeling your style
I’m loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You’re killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that…[Hook]
And shawty we all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up

A section full of them bitches

With out the knife scar

And survive y'all... NICE

This the flyest shit you may have heard
We all the way up in this Too Short's favorite word

[Hook]

Watch full of cuts blowin' spinach check the scenery
East side high tryna not to spill my lean on me
Oh shit dope dick bet your woman feign on me

Mic check test 1, 2 blue sing on me
You destined for fame don't you be ashamed
Tune into the game if that's Patron James
Then call me Dwayne Spade

She don't do meat call her Veggie Bush
I'm a fall back though I don't ever push

I'm a Telemundo freakin for the weekend
Eatin' clams mussels lobster
Kitchen bed sofa
Stretchin' like Rosa Acosta partna
You know I'm the coldest
On my North Pole shit
While you on your rockin' South Pole when it's cold shit

Don't ask me for hooks you can't afford my focus
Ya turns up Trigga turnt upIt's time to get money

White bucket like Gilligan wear

Red rover red rover send them bitches over here
You can also send the waiter, yeah I think his name Ramon
Tell his slow ass to c'mon wit that Grey Goose and Patron
Tryna get em in the zone da da da zone
So I can pick and roll like Stockton and Malone
Ya smell me, nah baby not my cologne
Let me be clear as some Bacardi Limon
Looky here Simone, you can call the phone
But if you ain't tryna bone you'll be talkin to the tone
I'm so cocky that all I wanna do is bone
I'm so Rocky my last name should be Stallone
I ain't Jimmy baby, I ain't here to Jones
Fuck whatcha talkin bout....its Los[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I won't be holding back, my love
I won't be holding back

No I won't be holding back
Cause in the end you'll know I'ma want another round
Another round, another round
Boy I know I want another round
Another round

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I used to want you and her and her
And you and her and her

[Mary J. Blige]
And now you got me alone and me tonight
I'ma give you my all
All I want is you

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Hair in a bun cause sometimes your hair just hides your beauty
Swear on my son, ain't too many things could hide your booty
Call me what you like, but bet I slide with cutie
Kenny name wasn't Bud, but he still ride with Rudy
And that's why we comfortable as a Huxtable
You been around since the Lunchables, girl I fucks with you
In the back of the truck with you, same fingers I chuck with two
I'm just playing with you, thinking bout staying with you
Not forever but at least until the A.M. with you
Still playing with it, but you like it raw
Might need a morning after, what we did the night before
Might go another round if you're trying to fight me more

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Cake cake cake cake cake, I know you love it
Icing like Nuvo with a touch of red velvet
Look at you, you a star
I'm a G, Joe the Don
Super thief, I go hard
In these sheets, I'm a God
Lord, Emilio Pucci leggings for good behavior
I wanna tear them shits off you like Hulkamania
Then dive up in the pussy, Superfly Snuka
Have you coming back to back, more sex to cook up
But ask the girl will I hit advance
She pokes it out picture perfect, Instagram
I hit home runs and drain last shots
She tore her ACL from all the backshots

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Bown]

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
See, she done came down
Double cup with ice
Man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong
Cause her boyfriend listen to me
I don't give a damn bout it
That nigga, if he trip, I got a whole clique of killers with me
See, I'm the man now
Rolling 24's through the hood, women checking for me
Girl, I ain't playing 'round
Pull up to the crib, hope you wearing something special for me
And I'mma lay it down
Round one, two, and three can you keep up with me

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & Chris Brown]A Toast to Mr. Tagalucci
And zipping open Louis duffle bags of lucci
Bragging loosley, 'bout bagging hoochies
No logos on the clothes but the tags say "Gucci" (nice)
And everybody raise your glasses
To beautiful tits and amazing asses
Bring cigar cutters and a tray for ashes
To money burials, hideaways, and stashes
Thanks to DEA's getting slick
They used bad tape, the charges didn't stick
The lawyers, Ebanks, Sadler
Life's a bitch and I probably could've had her
Here's to no witnesses
And playing dumb like "I don't know what this is"
I'm forgetful that's why I keep my shit full
Along with alarm systems and pit bulls
Good food, still needs seasoning
Gangsta POV, that's how we sees things
It's talked about with good reasoning
Over good steaks, and sweet Riesling
Yeah, Beef is just an entrée
Put stacks on a boy like his name "Andre"
All the shootouts and the killings
Sympathy for bad guys, rooting for the villains
I put my money up, loot is in the ceiling
And 2 baby nines that look cuter than some children
Cheers, blood, sweat, and tears
No room for emotions or fears
It's the way, nothing more to say
I make the call we could go to war today
This is Loso's Way
Follow me into Loso's Way[Hook: Kokane & E-40]

Bullshit, I never been about
I'm no angel, big gates, white leather on the couch
So it feel like heaven at the house
Ain't no reverend at the house, but I run it at the crib
Nigga, like you, all you runnin' is your lip
Don't let me catch you, or run into your bitch
