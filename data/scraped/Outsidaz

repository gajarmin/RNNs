[Intro: Bizarre]
Check this out
This is Bizarre
And this is the rap king DJ Butter
From tha Outsidaz
Bam Bam Bam!
Dirty Dozen
Outsidaz
Taking the whole world with me
2 blunts and I'm bringing ya girl with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
I'm high like Redman
Trippin' with a tab of acid in my headband
The name's Pacewon I'll kick that ass quickly
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Four rhymes penetrate ya kidneys
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down)
Take it with me
Take it with me
The whole world with me
I'll be hittin you with rude shit
I be rollin' like crews with new whips
Call it stupid but I've mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
More rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho
Spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Ya crew not strong
They stink like ya mother's feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn
Me disciplining' fresh emcees that you'd be scared to rock for
I'm low down and I'm shifty
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Most emcees get slapped cause they sissy
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm in a soundproof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180 proof Vodka with Dr. Ruth
We in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
Sitting in the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the board
Because we tied the engineer with outlet cords
Bizarre's in tha lobby with the Beatles
Smokin bowls, pokin holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from poppin uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers
Smokin homegrown drugs
That's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like Bone Thugs
Hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
And take one more short toke before I snort coke
Shit, I been doing lines all day
My mind's all played from smelling Pine Sol spray
What, no hold up hold up hold up
Smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
My lungs are all swol' up about to bust open
I'm just hopin I don't die from snortin crushed Motrin
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus I'm bringin ya girl with me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
I'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Wack emcees there's a new sheriff in town
Put ya guns down and die with an ill frown!
Tha Outsidaz doin uppas and downas
Clowners, even massa scared to hang around us
I'm a slob that don't have job
Peep through your window to steal the cook from ya mom
We just starters, ya'll niggas hit the bitches
Smackin more hoes than Jo Jackson has felony conviction
Clouds of mushrooms I just can't see
Pull me out tha bathroom I'm 'bout to OD!
Nasty, dirty some say I'm filthy
Everytime I drop a rap I'm a be like
MMMRRRRPHHH!
Crazy high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning diarrhoea
I'm ready to box so the bell go ding ding
My crew's more stupid and whack than Zazu from Lion King
Who's the big guy high off Chocolate Thai
If you disrespect me you'll lyrically die
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die I take the whole world with me
I'm bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die I take the whole world with me
Your grandma said I give as good as cleany
When I die I take the whole world with me

[Outro]
You know my flo is so ill
Emcees on the microphone'll get verbally killed[Intro: Young Zee]
*Talking*
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
95% of all y'all rappers butt
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, "If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls!"
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Bridge: Young Zee]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Hook: Young Zee]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa

[Verse 2: Slang Ton]
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like foreign Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'

[Break: Az-izz, (Young Zee), & [D.U.]]
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye (uh-huh)
Leave him paralized and (agonized)
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
[Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Huh?]

[Verse 3: Pace Won]
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't "Take The Crown Home"
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5-0 in a stolen gray Hummer

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from a city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
[Hook By: Eminem]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Refrain: Young Zee]
(Yeah!)
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Bridge]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Hook: Young Zee & Eminem]

[Outro: Young Zee]
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa
*talking*[Hook: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

[Verse 1: Az-Izz]
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

[Verse 2: Pace Won]
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slang Ton]
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)
Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years
([Pace Won] So dunn, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill?
([Pace won] There's more than one? IIIllll)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Young Zee]
Yea
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

[Verse 6: Axe]
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

[Hook]

[Outro: Pace Won]
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Outworld baby[Intro]
Ha ha ha haaaa!
Yeah, what the fuck
Outsidaz, we be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
Yeah, baby
Hard act to follow
Ha, yeah
So come on and come on
So come on and come on
So come on…

[Verse 1: Yah Yah]
Yah Yah
And I’ve been black balled and outlawed like 2Pac's posse
Still no cops, the neighborhood watch could stop me
I’m like Selassie driven in a Dodge Jeep
The God’s peace while i civilise Rah's beef
Unbelievers fall in 2000 leavers
Landing more needles than the route of all evil
Dom perignon, henny
Outsidaz, cause we all scary
Shells Buried from in hell’s very
Skunk glary, my 51 Chevy, gun's near me
Squatting on the wheelie with them truck jewelery
Come on

[Verse 2: Young Zee]
You got a big mouth, when you rap
I whip my dick out
And mouth-slap you and make you kiss my out tattoo
And leave you with wet stains until you bleed red rain
And for the next days you’ll need fucking X-rays for your chest pains
The Outz splurging for drinks, so I bought a round
Fuck the quarter pound, bitch, we lock this corner down
In a fact, you’ll be robing in a black pea coat
I’ll eat gold and flip the remote while you main bitch do me a deep throat
And word is raw since we all can’t get along til I’m dead and gone
Y'all gon' all get shitted on
Come on now

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!

[Verse 3: Azz-Iz]
Azz-Iz high as space high
You blonders state side, take sides
And get ate like steak fries
Unwise guys stuffed with televised lies
Till headaches buy size
Blood sung: sci fi
Off the wet pep, I need dregs and take lives
The raw rasta, bang harder and breaks the boxer
Flow's aqua, spada, lada void cutta
Burn ‘em, rip the infrared gutta
And the horror the terror for ya pappa sick and bye bye
Send a chopper, die before ya reach the doctor
C’mon!

[Verse 4: Slang Ton]
It's tha iza mashtons
I ya wanna hit your ass kicked, just hit the av and pick ya stash with sixty bags and
Get this fucking filling craft and get the matches
I smoke more than 50 chimney hatches
I'm never quick to passin'
I smoke and choke off Simon split this pattern
Rip-o-matic, tris-o-matic
Shit, I've had it, get the average nigga blasted
In a half a second, Slang the Fattest on a record
And check it, I ain't half this racket till that ass get naked
Settle for cash and slap, kid, pass the necklace

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Product of espionage
Pissed drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbian's crotch while pedestrians watch
Gangsters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It ain't a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While I'm in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness
I bleed bizarreness
Spitting blood like Kiss' lead guitarist

[Verse 6: Rah Digga]
Now who be yappin‘ ‘bout they shit the bomb
With them stife-ass tricks you tryna sell nickles for dimes
Boys, I’m that bitch
Chump change be 6 digits
Doing remixes for all them R and B bitches
Ya motherfuckin‘ rosters
Be filled with imposters
Digga not fresh like Lil Kim singin‘ gospel
‘Cause we be the tightest in this whole rap race
You get your contract cancelled like Homeboys In Outer Space
Come on

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!BROKEN DOOR FREESTYLE

[Verse 1]
On the floor lies a broken whore
Cos I'm not to be spoken to
I make metaphors
I'll put a hole in your head for I am resemblant to a saw
Ankles and I are similar for
We can both snap with a quick turn of emotions or directions
Both change the complexion of the track son and give you an erection
I'm a monsoon who
Dwells in the dark who don't smoke but ropes us dust
Yes, I'm tired of being
Lost without a bearing
And I'm fed up of being ignored, why should I be secluded?
I got a brand new horn that needs to be tooted
Watch, I'm going to the spot of top dog
And I don't wanna play leap frog
But how do I get there
All I get is a blank stare when I start prescribing, prescribing my crack here
Maybe they'll look up to you if you start vocal
Nah that shit is a thing of facebook'clart folklore's
I can't sing but my rhymes are good, too right
When I'm done spitting they'll be shitting on your mind all through the night
Maybe they'll give you nightmares, whenever you look in nice mirrors, scared to face a face that feels you with fear
When it pops up behind you
I'm talking about my wang fool
She got her behind up high bending over a bar stole
Of course yo, she got me stiffer than a disabled mannequin
I don't think this headache's ever banishing
I'm panicking, I think I've taken too much medicine
I think I'll get banished then, come back from the drug store like Romeo but then instead
Cum in with cinnamon, flavoured lip gloss
On my willy thing
My residence has bad representatives
And I got evidence
So I thought to hell with this
This is where I pick up the C
I'm assuming all responsibility
Cos looming inside of me
Is a rap dictionary that just wants to be free
To perform surgery with words like these
I went to the
Virgin Islands now it's just called islands
I danced with this
One girl and she said my style was cancerous
So I wished this, back home we can both be alone
My body got 206 bones but when I'm around you another one grows as quick as Bugatti engines
Try touch it you'll get escorted off go gotti henchman
I'm on a mission to get richer
The sickest lyric kicker the weakest will get disfigured
While I sip liqueur
Sit with a giant Warhol painting, get the big picture?
Woops, my girl said “Baby I'm late
But least you got more plays than Picasso got paint”
But they say “Well just like Gary and just like Jim
He likes the chicks that are younger than him”
Aw kid you can't say that it'll offend them
I don't give a fuck it was supposed ta
My minds so deadly it's like the headset is close to a holster
It's over
I control the whole vocal season
All postal regions
But now I need to take a breathe in
Cos yano us white guys
Gotta hold in our breathe for 5 mics (Shady)Yeah, huh uh, yeah
My girl came over looking sad
So I asked her whats wrong she said moms and dad
Daddy trippin so I asked her how?
She said daddy drunk pushing moms around
I'm like WHAT? I'mma break his neck
Cause moms kinda cool and deserve respect
Jumped in the Range Rover, I'mma smoke this punk
I made sure the joints was inside the trunk
Merked, Parkway South, til I reached his house
Moms on the porch with a busted mouth
Straight cryin tryin to get me to leave
Pops still cursin I can still smell trees
Dipped him from behind, tried to reach for his nine
Lift the four-fifths up and lost my mind
Start squeezin til he hit the floor
And gave that fool smooth what he askin for

[Hook]
Now, we be the O's for all those don't know
We gon' give you fools smooth what y'all askin for
Cash flow, mad gold, passin hash and 'dro
We gon' give you fools smooth what y'all askin for
Hoes, we got hoes that'll touch they toes
That give y'all fools smooth what y'all askin for
Blow, we gon' blow til theys blow no mo'
We gon' give you fools smooth what y'all askin for

Yo, yo
How many times must I tell you punks
I smell you skunks that want me to fail and flunk
Skip bail get jumped, nailed and stuck
Swelled in lumps, spend my life in the jail for one blunt
And my baby mother she don't make it no betta on me
Run around thinkin I'm cheatin on her, smellin my laundry
So fuck it I might as well do it, if I'mma get accused, shit
Make some plans up with a few chicks
Now outta the few one of them got it and called me back
Freaky Lisa, who like big blunts and cognac
Rough sex and all that she be blessin a nigga
Come to find out this my baby mother half sister
I had to think for a minute, sip my drink for a minute
Put the cup to my lips wasn't a fucking thing in it
Now I'm buggin, baby mother feelings all swole
All I can say is she got waht she asked for (Thats how it go)

Hook

Let me tell you about my man named Slang
We used to hang way back when P&S was the gang
We used to cut school and roll up trees play humpty
Stay ?lully? rockin collas and gray rugbys
My man fifty grand down for combat
Head was on straight til his mom passed
He started flippin, started mixin somethin up with the coco
Highjacked a bus and went loco
Yo he got caught went to jail
Then came back home, same rap tone but no where to live
No kids, no wife, no job, no ice
Can't cop a pair a kicks at no low price
Without a buck can't come up, clock or roll dice
Hard way to live when the night fall right
Outsida to the bone doing drugs even harder
Run up in the beauty parlor and reak havoc
Life is mad tragic, I believe in black magic
I'll be seeing you again, when my road end
Gotta A.P.B out and a message to send
Ride around everyday with my vest and my ten
So unless you a friend Pacewon don't wanna see ya
Don't be the next geek I heat up shoot twice and leave ya
Cut twice and beat up
R.I.P. I hope the rats find ya corpse and eat ya
No remorse either

Hook[Young Zee]
*Talking*
Yeah... it's just part of the game...
Know what I'm sayin'?...  Runnin' trains on these hoes...
Check me out now...

[Young Zee]
Girls, I got 'em locked like Casanova Rudd
After I fuck they'll need a bath to soak the blood
These young girls think they can screw?  I'm laughin' at 'em
I get in back and rag 'em; I use a whole pack of Magnums
My niggas get knocked for havin' on the vest blastin'
Court-type shit; your crew do time for trespassin'
Yo, see Dee?  Niggas might feel (???)
The video better look like Hype Williams filmed it
I hit the Internet to find out where to get a tec
And a pack of Dip cigarettes so tell me where to send a check
Bitch, your shit is drippin' sweat off my silhouette
Screamin' 'til you get it wet and I ain't even hit it yet
I'm failin' all my piss tests
Smokin' with these hoes with them big, big breasts
Uhh, uhh... so don't be ashamed
Let my man fuck, we'll be runnin' a train'

{Chorus}
[Axe] Yo, if a nigga act up he get one in the brain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] She let one of us fuck, man, we runnin' a train'
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] See, the O-U-Tz, we gon' come with the pain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] Yo, we bring the fuckin' noise like the thunder and rain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game

[Axe]
Axe, you can tell he's nice
Want enough dough to get my celly iced;
Tote guns bigger than Kelly Price
Droppin' mad bombs
Fuck safety, keep the gat on; .44 Taurus in my Phat Farm
Sucker, please, it's the O-U - fuckin' -Ts
They back puffin' trees' got your girl puffin' these
Fool, be strapped, no way you can do me, black
Let the tooley clap, put one in your bourgeois hat
Put your brains in your dooley lap
Like Air Max, I'm everywhere you be at, settin' booby traps
Holy shit!  Axe the black Moby Dick!
Yo, he's sick!  Walk out the door, he get, "Blow me, bitch!"
Fuck around, my crew might base
You should quit this and go back to school like Ma$e
Cause at rap you suck, I'll have to clap you ducks
Make the coroner wrap you up, ask two nuts

{Chorus}

{Hook: Pace Won}
Nobody run game like these Brick City niggas
We shuttin' down your spot; we takin' what you got
Yo, can't nobody set it off like them Brick City niggas
We bustin' at the cops; police on the block
Yo, don't nobody hold it down like them Brick City niggas
We shuttin' down your spot; we takin' what you got
Yo, don't nobody bring the ruck' like them Brick City niggas
We bustin' at the cops; police on the block

[Young Zee]
We could be together if you just listen and be strong
First you gotta fuck D.U. then you gotta fuck P-Long
Cops better rappin'?
That's like God and the Devil bein' friends again
That could never happen
I snap out, not even police chief can stop me
I be stompin' niggas' teeth with my beef and broccoli
Your whole tape run game
Your girl want bang, your whole clique run trains

He likes the chicks that are younger than him”
Aw kid you can't say that it'll offend them
I don't give a fuck it was supposed ta
My minds so deadly it's like the headset is close to a holster
It's over
I control the whole vocal season
All postal regions
But now I need to take a breathe in
Cos yano us white guys
Gotta hold in our breathe for 5 mics (Shady)[Young Zee]
Them niggas try to rob me could GET THE DICK
All them bitches try to play me they GET THE DICK
Niggas try to jump B.U. can GET THE DICK
We gon' bang when I see you so GET THE DICK
Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite

I got great skills
And if my record sells 8 mil
I'mma still smoke weed, get dusted, get drunk and take pills
Fast gun play gon' get you blast one day
Fucking with Zee, it be today mothafucka
Newark like a sitcom for no brains
???, Jettin from ? trains
Slip a tab and mushrooms in my coffee
With half a forty, feel like the walls is moving towards me
Till I die from old age
I'll be pullin girls up to suck my dick right on the stage
So stop talking, get them old jelli's walking
'Fore I call Pace celly walkman, and tell him yall been
Acting iffy, and its really starting to piss me
And like popcorn, my nigga's be here in a jiffy
Will all the Mack 10's step beside me
We gon' start wylin and kill everybody

[Pace Won]
Pace Won, Mr. Perfect, I take a warm shower
Make a condo, out of saw powder
Make the sun eclipse at the born hour
I'm a wizard at this shit like Juwon Howard
Put my gun up in the ass of crews
And start to spray, gotta pay massive dues
So I take Emcee's that pass the rules
And fly them into space like NASA do
I'm a, weed lover, going deep cover
Tricking these goofy ass ho's I need rubbers
Your favorite nucker, flow butter
Niggas get mobbed, leave with they clothes cut up
'When you comin' what they askin me

They bite, they never write, that's not polite

[Azz-Iz]
If your flow is kinda doo-doo
I more filthier than white bums from Newark (brick city!) to Honolulu
More wine than cherry, raspberry, apple-cranberry, strawberry
Muthafuckin flows extraordinary
Your bitch ass will get bodied and buried
By this slick walking, talking, rhyming dictionary
Gimme your mind, let me ? one
Fairly handsome, blackened like temper tantrums
Spittin like automatic handguns
You can't run
Your style is more garbage than Shirley Manson
You got a platinum single, roll me your money
I'm bummy but I bet I can get your bitch to beat my dick for me

[Bizarre]
Doin drive-bys in less than 2 minutes
And I know one of these houses on the block
Got your fuckin family in it
And what's the worstist, is y'all niggas gon' need nurses
I collect money on your block, like ushers at churches
No matter where your boys go, nigga I'mma get 'em
You can ask Swanson Funeral Home, how much business I be sendin 'em
You forgot bitch nigga, I know where you stay
Loaded AK, get little Johnny out the way
Bet you these bats gauruntee your ass won't be walking
I rock '98 Suburbans while you push cars from the auction
You don't wanna see Bizarre Kid get dumb
I beat a bitches ass when I'm in a good mood
So imagine if I'm in a bad one
You better duck when I pull this nine
I done shut up your block so many times
All I see is For Sale signs
They say these cats only got 9 lives
Bizarre done took 8, so tonight you diiiiiie

[Young Zee]
GET THE DICK
Yeah yeah yeah GET THE DICK

All you fuckers in Detroit GET THE DICK
Have you ever seen a show with niggas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite

You dummies
The reason bitches want me to spend money
Just to spread 'em like Gin Rummy
I'm Ya Ya
Holier than Roshashana
With baby mama's that's pro black like the Sada
The lover large and at peace with his god
Behind bars, yall nigga's sittin close with the gaurds
Fucking with yall, I'm always catchin charts
Yall won't let us box, yall wanna run and tell the Sarge
Life's short, I play hard
See your crew on the streets
Better know I won't hesitate to spray yall
I keep a rifle killing you and everybody looking like you
Fag, it's a never ending cycle
Can't nobody come and save you when I start shit
My lead is like Kryptonite to them Clark Kent's
I rip a crew with dust and liquor too
Too despicable
Toss you off the terace on ritaloo(ritual)
I rise like Christ
The third knight on mics
But it ain't Easter
It's only death when I meet you
So GET THE DICK[Intro]
Ha ha ha haaaa!
Yeah, what the fuck
Outsidaz, we be a hard act to follow

Hard act to follow
Ha, yeah
So come on and come on
So come on and come on
So come on…

[Verse 1: Yah Yah]
Yah Yah
And I’ve been black balled and outlawed like 2Pac's posse
Still no cops, the neighborhood watch could stop me
I’m like Selassie driven in a Dodge Jeep
The God’s peace while i civilise Rah's beef
Unbelievers fall in 2000 leavers
Landing more needles than the route of all evil
Dom perignon, henny
Outsidaz, cause we all scary
Shells Buried from in hell’s very
Skunk glary, my 51 Chevy, gun's near me
Squatting on the wheelie with them truck jewelery
Come on

[Verse 2: Young Zee]
You got a big mouth, when you rap
I whip my dick out
And mouth-slap you and make you kiss my out tattoo
And leave you with wet stains until you bleed red rain
And for the next days you’ll need fucking X-rays for your chest pains
The Outz splurging for drinks, so I bought a round
Fuck the quarter pound, bitch, we lock this corner down
In a fact, you’ll be robing in a black pea coat
I’ll eat gold and flip the remote while you main bitch do me a deep throat
And word is raw since we all can’t get along til I’m dead and gone
Y'all gon' all get shitted on
Come on now

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!

[Verse 3: Azz-Iz]
Azz-Iz high as space high
You blonders state side, take sides
And get ate like steak fries
Unwise guys stuffed with televised lies
Till headaches buy size
Blood sung: sci fi
Off the wet pep, I need dregs and take lives
The raw rasta, bang harder and breaks the boxer
Flow's aqua, spada, lada void cutta
Burn ‘em, rip the infrared gutta
And the horror the terror for ya pappa sick and bye bye
Send a chopper, die before ya reach the doctor
C’mon!

[Verse 4: Slang Ton]
It's tha iza mashtons
I ya wanna hit your ass kicked, just hit the av and pick ya stash with sixty bags and
Get this fucking filling craft and get the matches
I smoke more than 50 chimney hatches
I'm never quick to passin'
I smoke and choke off Simon split this pattern
Rip-o-matic, tris-o-matic
Shit, I've had it, get the average nigga blasted
In a half a second, Slang the Fattest on a record
And check it, I ain't half this racket till that ass get naked
Settle for cash and slap, kid, pass the necklace

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Product of espionage
Pissed drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbian's crotch while pedestrians watch
Gangsters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It ain't a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While I'm in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness
I bleed bizarreness
Spitting blood like Kiss' lead guitarist

[Verse 6: Rah Digga]
Now who be yappin‘ ‘bout they shit the bomb
With them stife-ass tricks you tryna sell nickles for dimes
Boys, I’m that bitch
Chump change be 6 digits
Doing remixes for all them R and B bitches
Ya motherfuckin‘ rosters
Be filled with imposters
Digga not fresh like Lil Kim singin‘ gospel
‘Cause we be the tightest in this whole rap race
You get your contract cancelled like Homeboys In Outer Space
Come on

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)

We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on![Young Zee]
I from the place where if your motherfuckin jury gleam gleamin
Like gay shit you takin' off your bracelet
My niggas start wilin' I'm gonna let 'em do them
They gonna start shootin, I'ma make sure they take ya new rims
I'm making it all on zoom lens and tell a story
With a body in my trunk like N.O.R.E. ya tape corny
I push a Porsche like Mike Lorri, what'choo think?
Takin' niggas diamonds like I'm Mister Pink
I doin this to the death 'til I take six in the chest
Bustin that cops ???, resistin arrest
Rob you with no gun, here take yo' Lexus
Trade it with my man for them two CRX's
To my hoes I'm Snoopy, you be Woodchuck
Ya pussy be good luck, I don't let nobody in my hood fuck
I neva wait or hesitate, there be anotha nigga there naked
Jumpin outta that bitch wet in ???
Singin...

Hook 1:

Captivated by the sound
Turn it up, play it loud
Steady boys, stand'cha ground
Thats the way its going down
La la la la laaaaa
La la la la la laaaaaa
La la la la laaaaa
Thats the way its going down

[Pacewon]
Yo, yo
We write the songs like Biz that got everybody jockin
With Rhymes like Busta we keep the party rockin
OutWorld music tight like your mommies stockings
Our services cost more than Johnnie Cochran
I got my hand on my gauge, man on a rage
Wild, push ya man off the stage, he land on his face
Y'all wanna battle with Pace, fam you ain't safe
Might pull a gat from the waist, blast you with eight
Mad slugs, you'll be bleedin from the ass up
Mad blood, enough to fill up any bath tub
If you got street smarts you betta use 'em
I take out a couple like a two-some
Two non-descript kids talkin out loud on how they flip bricks
Its like we buyin a truck that only fit six
Unheard of, both hands on my burna'
Flesh wound niggas, y'all don't really want murda

[Axe]
Anymore movement, even a slight twitch'll further the crisis
Trife is a cereal killer, murder with ice picks
Tagged you on ya temple twice kid which left you lifeless
Hit your honey to hard, with twenty two bars of precise'ness
Pass the bone and watch how stoned I get
And ain't nothin fuckin with the chrome I grip
Can't atone for the domes I split
The trife is, I'm beatin down cops with they own nightsticks
Get locked up at four-thirty I'll just phone my chick
Don't matter what the bail is, I'll be home by six
I'm tight, bitches grab my biscuits slap 'em twice with it
Gonna sell more albums than those Spice bitches
I'm nice with it, holy like Christ scriptures
All the mullah, the best yet sendin death threats thru ya computer
I we got the buddha, copped the ruger
Bullets rockin through ya, BOO-YAH
Your brains on the nigga next to ya

Hook 2:

We run your little bitch ass down
You're standin on shaky ground
Paranoid to move around
Thats the way its going down
La la la la laaaaa
La la la la la laaaaaa
Lal la la la laaaaa
Thats the way its going down

[Yah Yah]
I'm not to be crossed, your postures soft
I'll dump a mobster boss face in pasta sauce, huh
It took a fellow two beat downs and bullet
For him to understand Outsidaz don't bullshit
I unload a whole clip of Scarecrows four-fifth
I roast ?toe tips? the forceps started to roast shit
So what, your ho bitch loves to blow dicks
For four sticks she blew me and my whole click
You testin me with certain things I don't want to argue
I'm gonna get you for your chi-chi-chi-change and your car too
You a DC comic, I'm a Marvel
The black Fire Bill Marshall, ill aresenal

Hook 1[Intro: Young Zee]
*Talking*
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
95% of all y'all rappers butt
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, "If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls!"
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Bridge: Young Zee]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Hook: Young Zee]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa

[Verse 2: Slang Ton]
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like foreign Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'

[Break: Az-izz, (Young Zee), & [D.U.]]
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye (uh-huh)
Leave him paralized and (agonized)
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
[Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Huh?]

[Verse 3: Pace Won]
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't "Take The Crown Home"
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5-0 in a stolen gray Hummer

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from a city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
[Hook By: Eminem]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Refrain: Young Zee]
(Yeah!)
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Bridge]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Hook: Young Zee & Eminem]

[Outro: Young Zee]
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa
*talking*[Az-Izz]
I'm Az-Izz, y'all can't stop me
Make a G a day sellin stolen drop three's
Ain't nuttin funny, run up on you when its sunny
Pump two in your tummy, all for the money
When I coped the five, with the Batman eyes
You could ride, but first hustlin ?Q-4-5's?

[Young Zee]
Yeah, yeah
Niggas live for it, niggas die for it
End up on the run, with thirty-five warrants
Ya boy will get'choo shot with'cha gun
Leave you layin there screamin at the top of your lungs
Zee rob white guys with nice lives
I'm tight cocked, only mess with girls that got five jobs
Do crack wit'choo, sit around and they laugh
Those same niggas get you for a pound and a half
Beef start, better keep the spark
'Cuz a fool and his money will soon depart

Chorus: Zee (Outsidaz)

I'm tryin to keep money (Keep money, money, money)
Deep money (Deep money, money, money)
Weed money (Weed money, money, money)
Leave my seed money (Seed money, money, money)
I need trick money (Trick money, money, money)
Quick money (Quick money, money, money)
Get me real rich money (Rich money, money, money)
I need... (Money, money, money)
I need... (Money, money, money)

[Yah Yah]
Yo...
You on the frozen budget, I'm holdin dutches
Anything I wanna do, I goes and does it
I'ma shine like a pile of golden nuggets
Catch me in GQ posin rugged
Nasty fellow, pick my nose in public
Wipe the snot on my clothes, shockin the hoes
Chillin with Chris, smokin pot in the Rolls
For the love of money, I'ma stay down
Trade pounds, and jail bound
Bringin drugs on the Greyhound

[Denzy]
Yo yo
Aiyyo, Denzy, Benz Jeep, ten freaks behind me
(I like) M-P's and rhymin
(I like) M3's and diamonds
(I just) empty the nine if you attemptin to rob 'em
Start wilin', gettin money from bricks from Long Island, uhh
Give me that paper dogg, I gotta have it
White ?liver? pockets so money is automatic
We done bought the carrots
And you still lookin sorta savage
Theres a whole lotta money out there, you oughtta grab it

Chorus

[DU]
My creation is free basin, replaced 'em
Won't see DU on VH1, you's a wannabe DJ Run
We lace blunts, peer pressure
At least take some, he play dumb
Always and forever heat wavin
Put a mask on y'all meet Jason
This paper need chasin
Roll with teenagers, smokin green acres
Smell that free fragrance, thats bomb weed baby

[Nawshis]
Keep your raps up, you'll be the king
Shoutin "Can't nobody do me a thing"
With mad jewelry to bling
Sittin chunky, then dip this honey
Pushin Excursions and Suburbans, gettin money
If these fake players and playa'rettes
They get me major vexed
I wave a tech, have 'em comin out they Avirex
So your ?willie pad? is gettin recalled
I'ma teach all y'all to speed ball

Chorus x2 with some variations[Pace Won]
Who that smoked-out kid that do more drugs than a rock star?
Not far from bein' in the back seat of a cop car
Top dog that falls the fuck off, now he fiendin'
The need for drugs got his ass stealin'
He asks you for pocket change and cigarettes every time you see him
White shit around his lips; he got open sores, bleedin'
Kid blast more fast than Pete Rock could flip a remix
Hope he don't OD like River Phoenix
Hope his ass gets himself together and his people live to see it
All his felonies become misdemeanors
He shootin' up hot heroin, one dub, intravenous
Robbin' niggas cleaner than the cleaners

[Hook - Pace Won]
Yo, some people fiend for it, spend some cream on it
They slip and get addicted, drop a G on it
Next thing, they trip and they think their house haunted
Niggas never should've got what they wanted

[Hook - Pace Won]
Yo, if you crack the fuck out you need rehab
Dope the fuck up you need rehab, rehabilitation
It's drug therapy for a patient
Kickin' cold turkey got them kooky niggas shakin'
Yo!

[Az-Izz]
Az-Izz, ex-Mad Math wiz
Now I'm addicted to pills, hash, and acid
For denouncin' Jevohah, first time I got high, it was over
Got drunker than Grady off JD and Coca-Cola
I broke bread with dopehead (??) that broke legs for mopeds
Plus Axe fatter than the ass on Jennifer Lopez
Sniff lines with cokeheads and bring the Rawkus like Mos Def

[Nawshis]
Remember this; bad habits only get worser
When your lungs insert lye, they just tryin' to reach the first high
I used to smoke, drink mad brew straight
Still be sober, so I had to graduate
Nawshis; I'm addicted to gettin' lifted
Didn't know not to, havin' rap a role model
Until I heard Redman hit the rope
I heard Mobb Deep sniffed coke
Yo, Yo!

[Hook]

[Hook]

[D.U.]
I'm the rehab specialist
Checkin' shit from testosterone to female estrogen
Stethoscope, check your pulse, detox shock treatment
No eavesdrop, it's top secret
Yo, Dr. Giggle; I jot down notes and start to scribble
I figured out the riddle; ain't shit wrong with you
(??????)I take acid with pain tablets
A strange habit but that shit keeps my brains blasted
Unbalanced chemicals bend the rules; break in lockers
Stealin' tennis shoes; back in the day you should've finished school
Was the man of the playground, now you're waist down
Here's a shot of redemption; go make some cake now

[Hook & Hook 2x][Hook: Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up

[Verse 1: Az-Izz]
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

[Verse 2: Pace Won]
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slang Ton]
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)
Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years
([Pace Won] So dunn, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill?
([Pace won] There's more than one? IIIllll)
What? You want me to stop? Here?

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Young Zee]
Yea
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

[Verse 6: Axe]
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

[Hook]

[Outro: Pace Won]
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Outworld baby[Intro: Bizarre]
Check this out
This is Bizarre
And this is the rap king DJ Butter
From tha Outsidaz
Bam Bam Bam!
Dirty Dozen
Outsidaz
Taking the whole world with me
2 blunts and I'm bringing ya girl with me

[Verse 1: Pacewon]
I'm high like Redman
Trippin' with a tab of acid in my headband
The name's Pacewon I'll kick that ass quickly
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Four rhymes penetrate ya kidneys
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down)
Take it with me
Take it with me
The whole world with me
I'll be hittin you with rude shit
I be rollin' like crews with new whips
Call it stupid but I've mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
More rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as Brillo, nympho
Spreading like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Ya crew not strong
They stink like ya mother's feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn
Me disciplining' fresh emcees that you'd be scared to rock for
I'm low down and I'm shifty
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Most emcees get slapped cause they sissy
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm in a soundproof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180 proof Vodka with Dr. Ruth
We in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
Sitting in the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the board
Because we tied the engineer with outlet cords
Bizarre's in tha lobby with the Beatles
Smokin bowls, pokin holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from poppin uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown without rubbers
Smokin homegrown drugs
That's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like Bone Thugs
Hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
And take one more short toke before I snort coke
Shit, I been doing lines all day
My mind's all played from smelling Pine Sol spray
What, no hold up hold up hold up
Smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
My lungs are all swol' up about to bust open
I'm just hopin I don't die from snortin crushed Motrin
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus I'm bringin ya girl with me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
I'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Wack emcees there's a new sheriff in town
Put ya guns down and die with an ill frown!
Tha Outsidaz doin uppas and downas
Clowners, even massa scared to hang around us
I'm a slob that don't have job
Peep through your window to steal the cook from ya mom
We just starters, ya'll niggas hit the bitches
Smackin more hoes than Jo Jackson has felony conviction
Clouds of mushrooms I just can't see
Pull me out tha bathroom I'm 'bout to OD!
Nasty, dirty some say I'm filthy
Everytime I drop a rap I'm a be like
MMMRRRRPHHH!
Crazy high, have no fear
Eat the pussy of a girl with burning diarrhoea
I'm ready to box so the bell go ding ding
My crew's more stupid and whack than Zazu from Lion King
Who's the big guy high off Chocolate Thai
If you disrespect me you'll lyrically die
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die I take the whole world with me
I'm bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die I take the whole world with me
Your grandma said I give as good as cleany
When I die I take the whole world with me

Yo, yo, yo

Bird catch it highed up til his eyes crossed
Fat belly, tall boy loungin with his socks off
No tan, toe jam like Roseanne
Got guns so big I bust with both hands
Pull 9 M-M's and tecs that don't jam
Mad family and friends in the drug program

[Method Man]
I go *raaaaarr raaaaarr* like I had cereberal palsy
We ain't got no time to be playin with y'all see
Shoalin, Dirty Jers' what y'all ain't heard?
Fuckin ya birds, pluckin ya nerves, puffin ya herb
Slap ya C.E.O. off his podeum

Wrapped around a hot nickelodeon
Oh seven one three oh four thats the code we in
School of hard knocks here we go again

[Young Zee]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aiyyo Hot Nicks you got me noddin of the doses
While the Outs burn bush like God talkin to Moses
They mad I push the F1 with three front seats
Rock fatter chains than slave workers had on they feet
Smoke blunts til my breath smell, hop on my Nextel
Chick from West L bang her head against the bed rail
Ya'll betta leave 'fore Zee get evil
I'll tell you a secret, I see dead people

[Redman]
Aiyyo, aiyyo Pace
The Doc sports timbs with no lace
I come in her mouth and it look like colgate
I'm a gorilla, chewin on bananas
Psycho Im the one that blew my head in ?scanners?
BRICKS, lyrics and guns gotta stay smokin
Even Live to L.A. don't leave the gate open
I carry two shotties and I'mma squeeze both'um
And when I'm done me and ya bitch elopin

Hook:

Rock the Bells mix it with Duke Ellington

[Method Man]

Hard headed dick gotta pussy fetish
Get'cha cosmetic, Meth at it call a medic
And while we said it
These niggas wanna catch amnesia and like forget it

Creep with me as I roll through the stack
Maniac, lunatic and my whole click packed

[Pacewon]
Aiyyo Doc
I be spaced like Star Wars
Hardcore nigga don't lock my car doors
I rock shells toes backspin on cardboard
Gazelle type frames, wave caps, and four-fours
Graffiti to place leave my tag Pace Blunta
The barrel of my Glock stay hot like late summer
You freckle motherfuckas need shade to lay under
JAKE HUNTER, look but don't bite I take cover

Hook x2Explain (Intro)
I can't keep chasing you
Taking my life like that

[Verse 1: Rabbit]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this chick had acted right I would've stayed
If she had played things right we could be great
But I've already wasted two years away
I would've laid down and died for you
I no longer cry for you
No more pain, bitch you
Took me for granted, took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Until it hurt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'mma take control of this relationship command it
And I'mma be the boss of you now god damn it
And what I mean is that I'm now longer dedicated to you now homie
My love I'mma take it elsewhere unless you blow me
And that's just one thing that you owe me
I let up my love life for you
Totally devoted to you;
Why I've stayed single, faithful all this way
And this is how I fucking get repaid
Look how much I stress
Never having sex
Always in a mess
Always checking my phone in hope there's a text there from you
I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you've just treated me like a staircase just another step
And I ain't coming back so don't hold your fucking breathe
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I laughed while you wept
Crept up to him and told you how we're each others meth
How's it feel now? Yeah funny ain't it?
You neglected me, did me a favour and all my spirit free you set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's

(Chorus)
Too late
For another try
Stuck in this maze
25 to life x2
Too late

[Verse 2: Rabbit]
I feel like when I define my feelings for you do all you do is laugh
Cos that ain't good enough
You expect me too write it on your wall in a rap
Don't think I'm loyal? All I do is wank
I can not turn over on my side
I have no life outside of that
Did I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
I was always texting you every minute of my life
Always jealous when I spent time with the girls
Why I'm attached to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving this string with scissors I'm cutting it
Go use someone else to make you famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Leave them out of no where like you did to me
Now we swapping places I'm moving on forget you
Oh, now I'm special?
I ain't feel special when I was in you
All I ever felt was this, helplessness
Imprisoned, by a selfish bitch
Chewed me up and spit me out I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
But in my sickness and addiction you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, addictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from you
I'm addicted, to the pain and stress
The drama, so I guess I'mma mess
Cursed and blessed but this time I
Ain't changing my mind I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that'll be missed
But when you spoke of people that meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you, it's up
I'm leaving you for good
My life sentenced is served, bitch
And it's just

(Chorus)[Young Zee]
*Talking*
Yeah... it's just part of the game...
Know what I'm sayin'?...  Runnin' trains on these hoes...
Check me out now...

[Young Zee]
Girls, I got 'em locked like Casanova Rudd
After I fuck they'll need a bath to soak the blood
These young girls think they can screw?  I'm laughin' at 'em
I get in back and rag 'em; I use a whole pack of Magnums
My niggas get knocked for havin' on the vest blastin'
Court-type shit; your crew do time for trespassin'
Yo, see Dee?  Niggas might feel (???)
The video better look like Hype Williams filmed it
I hit the Internet to find out where to get a tec
And a pack of Dip cigarettes so tell me where to send a check
Bitch, your shit is drippin' sweat off my silhouette
Screamin' 'til you get it wet and I ain't even hit it yet
I'm failin' all my piss tests
Smokin' with these hoes with them big, big breasts
Uhh, uhh... so don't be ashamed
Let my man fuck, we'll be runnin' a train'

{Chorus}
[Axe] Yo, if a nigga act up he get one in the brain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] She let one of us fuck, man, we runnin' a train'
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] See, the O-U-Tz, we gon' come with the pain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game
[Axe] Yo, we bring the fuckin' noise like the thunder and rain
[Zee] That's the type shit that get done in the game

[Axe]
Axe, you can tell he's nice
Want enough dough to get my celly iced;
Tote guns bigger than Kelly Price
Droppin' mad bombs
Fuck safety, keep the gat on; .44 Taurus in my Phat Farm
Sucker, please, it's the O-U - fuckin' -Ts
They back puffin' trees' got your girl puffin' these
Fool, be strapped, no way you can do me, black
Let the tooley clap, put one in your bourgeois hat
Put your brains in your dooley lap
Like Air Max, I'm everywhere you be at, settin' booby traps
Holy shit!  Axe the black Moby Dick!
Yo, he's sick!  Walk out the door, he get, "Blow me, bitch!"
Fuck around, my crew might base
You should quit this and go back to school like Ma$e
Cause at rap you suck, I'll have to clap you ducks
Make the coroner wrap you up, ask two nuts

{Chorus}

{Hook: Pace Won}
Nobody run game like these Brick City niggas
We shuttin' down your spot; we takin' what you got
Yo, can't nobody set it off like them Brick City niggas
We bustin' at the cops; police on the block
Yo, don't nobody hold it down like them Brick City niggas
We shuttin' down your spot; we takin' what you got
Yo, don't nobody bring the ruck' like them Brick City niggas
We bustin' at the cops; police on the block

[Young Zee]
We could be together if you just listen and be strong
First you gotta fuck D.U. then you gotta fuck P-Long
Cops better rappin'?
That's like God and the Devil bein' friends again
That could never happen
I snap out, not even police chief can stop me
I be stompin' niggas' teeth with my beef and broccoli
Your whole tape run game
Your girl want bang, your whole clique run trains

{Chorus}[Pace Won] (Young Zee)
Yea yea yea yea yea yah
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yah yah (Ha, yah)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo (Yah, yah, yah yo yo, yo)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo (Yah, yah, it's the Bricks)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo (Yah it's the Bricks)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo (Ahaha it's the Bricks)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo (It's the Bricks, bitch)
Yo yo yo yo yo yo HYUH! (Ahahaha, ahaha)

[Pace Won]
Slap y'all hacksaw ask me what you rap for
Run up in your crib with a hacksaw (BANG)
Tired of cops, I put your life in a box
Before I tie up your pops and let him HANG
Yo, as far as this go, I'm like the mummy
Exploiting the ancient Egypt science of life and math for money
The Godfather flow I'm like Sonny
The number one thief; Mr. Wild Out like KEITH MURRAY!

[Young Zee]
Yea
When I'm drunk, puffin canibus skunk
I start shit with ya, beat ya manager up
Then battle every one of y'all that're rattlesnakes
It's like I haven't ate, and your clique smell like carrot cake
?Place lead in chicken's head? give up cookies
Then pass the fuck out like piss in bitches' pussies
The Capricorn, my dick be lastin long
Fuck raw first, GET THE RUBBER SLAP IT ON!
So girls I'm scoping you, who could hold me closest
Curve your back like multiple scoliosis
Fellas' beef, only start if you whiffin
I turn your chest into barbecue chicken

Chorus
[Pace Won]
Don't look now, we top billing it, filling it
My raps, my life, my style, my crew, we killing it
Money in the head we ice grilling it, stealing it
Your raps, your life, your style, your crew, we killing it

[Pace Won]
I drink too much liquor, got a bad liver
Streets is watching me like I'm Jigga; STARING
Chew your crew up like they was spearmint
Kick a verse, people go crazy when they hear it (HYUH!)
First I had no deal, now I'm living lovelier
Cause I'm on Columbia, spending all they money up
I got that hurry up, quick quick
Bust mad style in the pussy, like when me and my honey fuck
*Pacer, Pacer, don't make me chase ya with a razor
Blow up like Michael Jordan pager!*
It ain't a thing thing thing
*First week I'm goin gold!*
That's that ring ring ring
*Just like De La Soul?!*
No matter what the job, I hit the task faster
Educate and teach y'all like the Blastmaster
And from the vision Heaven sending me
I can see myself on the cover of Ebony
The cover of XXL, the cover of Fresh
The cover of the Source, and the cover of Stress
Pace Won, lace buds, smoke with Gov-G
Or tour around the world with my man Young Zee

[Azz-Iz]
Left bolt, bust off, see me hit the deck first
It's like my tech's curse, you be giving me expert
You know the difference, Az the type to go the distance
And you ain't, so we can't have this coexistence
Yo it's only rich, ain't no getting poor
Dough is what I'm on a misison itching for
For the love of this I get the four kicking door
Leave a fella's bra twitching saw him on the kitchen floor
Most of y'all sound retarded to me
I'm the hottest shit, since that nigga Moses, parted the sea
And y'all can keep hating when I'm the one you like
Weed got my eyes squinting like the sun too bright

[Pace Won]
YO!
Chorus x2[Hook]
[YOUNG ZEE] Do we do it for the underground? (HELL YEAH!)
[YOUNG ZEE] Girls want us when they come around (HELL YEAH!)
[YOUNG ZEE] We make all of ya'll want it now (HELL YEAH!)
[YOUNG ZEE] Model chicks wanna tongue us down (HELL YEAH!)
[ YAH YAH ] Do we get pumped in the radio (HELL YEAH!)
[ YAH YAH ] Do girls get naked in our videos (HELL YEAH!)
[ YAH YAH ] We smoke weed in the studio (HELL YEAH!)
[ YAH YAH ] Get brains after every show (HELL YEAH!)

[Pacewon]
One time for my people, my blunted out heads
We represent the real, let the underground spread
To the kids in the high schools, hoods that you drive through
Made for the kids with the higher I.Q
Got sent to that Rah Rah, I Declare War shit
Outsidaz, Night Life, witty metaphor shit
Start in the basement, push til it's corporate
Put in a place, to be sold and make a fortunate, for example

[Azz-Iz]
The deeper it get, the deeper we go
Ya talk tough, but beem in the O's, weak in the blows
Plus you don't go enough meat on ya bones
Mess around'll you'll sleep from this weaker then nome
I'm like M.L.K., when I'm speakin' a pawn
Settin' mad bullet sprays til they reachin' ya thong
For cats that grow naps never seakin' a comb
Sloman Shield couldn't help you when we creep in ya home

[Hook]

[Nawshis]
To ya fake niggas, that said I'll never make it
Ya trick is in my bed right now, ass naked
I taught ya ho, how to properly act
Now she got three cribs, you pay the property tax
You can catch me in the Bricks, lookin' plush in the six
Wit ya main chicken, she suckin' my dick
Fuckin' wit God, producin' nothin' but hits
Wanna battle my click, go ahead and spit
You not fresh, nope, you not def
Like Tribe Called Quest, I gets served flat as a Hot Sex
To take a chick to shop at lot less
Date a bitch from my projects, she runnin' ya pockets

[D.U.]
That's you-a, grindin' in that cat Cougar
Gat smoother than Zab Judah in black Puma's
Cash ruler, change my name to Abdullah
While ya A&R trynna make ya track smoother
Hit the liquor store than get the raw in ya jaw
That stick ya, then chill like it's still vinegar
From projects to Bel-Air, models chicks to welfare
Do we get the punky? (HELL YEAH!)

[Hook 2X]

HELL YEAH!
HELL YEAH!
HELL YEAH!
HELL YEAH![Young Zee]
Is it, I loose my cool, every once in a blue moon
Leave a girl stranded in a hotel room
Cuz ain't nothin' worse then flirtin' and teasin'
Trynna lift the skirt (I'm a virgin) I'm leavin'
You a virgin? You know you do this often
You're thing is so deep you can drown a school of dogs in
It's like every M.C., she done did it
Redman tapped, Lil' Weezy done hit it
Even them Boys from the Beastie done did it
Lil' Cease and R&B singers split it
Rumor has it from word of mouth
That ya thing's more dirtier than the dirty south
And I keep model chicks screamin' out, he a dog
Bust his ears hard, now she look like Nia Long
So, cute girls come jump in my ride
And all you buffalo gals go round the outside

[Hook: Kelis]
I'm leavin, I think I'll take the plane
It's the same, and nothing's ever changed
Sorry, beggin' you, I'll blow the range
Since we be owed to you, was actin' strange
I, never thought that I
Could ever be wit such a guy, would always cheat and lie

[Pacewon]
She fell in love wit a star, the life, the car
The "HUH, HUH, HAH!!"
Open like what wit a butt like Kim
When I seen it, it made me wanna nut right then
Yo, we got fly, we talked, she stopped bye
Lit the choc' lye, and passed it clockwise
Let me knock the boots, til I was cock-eyed
And now she trynna act like she ain't got time
I told her, think of this before you try to be foul
There's ladies at the bar that could be buyin' me rounds
And all type models that be eyein' me down
I stay and you say good-bye to me now?
Fuck that, diss me, that's what's up here
You better get ya fat ass back up stairs
And if you try to creep, I'mma tie you in the basement
Catch ya little boyfriend and beat his little face in

[Hook]

[Rah Digga]
Now all my sisters in the place
No matter what the race, we share a common cause
Everything be everything, get treated like a queen
Til we give up the drawers
Now just when I thought, everything was cool
Let a brother even have a key
I said I let him use the car, then he took it too far
Brother out there cheatin' on me
Time to face the truth, when I really didn't want to
How the hell all these hoes keep gettin' my number?
Who was it? A distant cousin, came to see you
In prison, they said you already had a visit
Beefin' wit these strangers, how do you explain this?
Came this close to lettin' you put it in my anus
Wakin' up, middle of the night, brother out
Time to get the steppin', back to ya mother house, boy
I'm leavin'

[Hook 2X][Pacewon]
What you want wit the underground kings from the Bricks
I've been at it since Clyde Frazier played for the Knicks
Packin' 3-5-7's wit the raw hide grips
Rollin' 4-5-6 on ya cross eyed tricks
War type shit, so get off my dick
I'm wet like Pirelli's on the vet
Here I go, pull up in the stretch
Ballin' like the Nets, like ten pass ya marks on my net
Woman love me, wantin' lust for me like people do money
They hungry, I might start livin' too lully
Got a A+ average and I'm bound to make honor roll
Jumpin' in and out of hoes' lives like geronimo
Put it on wax, make it sound kinda comical
Bitches listen to it while they work they abdominals
G's listen to it while they out playin' dominoes
Outsidaz try'nna match the face on the article

[Hook: Young Zee]
To my people from the Bricks keep on
Everybody up in Jerz, keep on
And it won't be long til the Outz invade
So we came to sing this sing

[Young Zee]
You know my block get cash
Twenty in street wit pop plus hash
Mess around, see a cop get blast

Outsidaz, what, what, what, like today
We doin' it to girls look like Tyra Banks
Drop the CD, girls hawkin' a nigga
They still wanna creep, they know I'm talkin' to Digga
You think you raw, I'mma test your jaw
You don't have a clue like Ernesto Shaw
See me on ya block, better give me those props
Before I start another beef worse then Biggie and Pac
We got macks and 4-4's to bust
And we don't buy clothes for girls, they buy clothes for us
Peace, to my homies doin' time in jail
And to ya niggas that be hatin', ya'll can rot in hell

(Yo hot like gun flames, we copped enough grade
Take the story make the front page
All about a man wit a bulletproof coatin' chrome shotty
Ain't takin' shit from nobody)
And punk ya'll can make me use the steel and blast ya Coupe D'eville
Hit the right side up, make ya loose a wheel
Outsidaz drunk, can't walk a straight line
Me and Pace blind off the 1-8-9
(Tell the cops that the gun ain't mine, some may find and go
All day shine, I'm no joke
Pacewon, the type of man, that you don't play close
Better throw up ya hands when my folks say so)

[Hook: Young Zee]
To my people in V.A., keep on
Everybody up in Philly, keep

And punk ya'll can make me use the steel and blast ya Coupe D'eville
Hit the right side up, make ya loose a wheel
Outsidaz drunk, can't walk a straight line
Me and Pace blind off the 1-8-9
(Tell the cops that the gun ain't mine, some may find and go
All day shine, I'm no joke
Pacewon, the type of man, that you don't play close
Better throw up ya hands when my folks say so)

[Chorus: Young Zee]
To my people in V.A., keep on
Everybody up in Philly, keep
And it won't be long til the Outz invade
So we came to sing this sing

[Hook: Pacewon]
We like (woop!), love our shit or leave it alone [x4]

[Outro: Young Zee]
Jacksonville, keep on
Little Rock, keep on
Vancouver, keep on
Seattle, keep on[Young Zee]
*Talking*
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...
[Young Zee]
95% of all y'all rappers butt
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice, stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, "If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls!"
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa

[Slang Ton]
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like Oran Dice, I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga, I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'

[Az-izz]
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye
Leave him paralized and agonized
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[D.U.]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco

[Pace Won]
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like Brownstone you couldn't "Take The Crown Home"
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, dickin' 5-0 in a stolen gray Hummer

[Eminem]
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa

[Young Zee]
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Macosa
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa[Az-Izz]
I'm Az-Izz, y'all can't stop me
Make a G a day sellin stolen drop three's
Ain't nuttin funny, run up on you when its sunny
Pump two in your tummy, all for the money
When I coped the five, with the Batman eyes
You could ride, but first hustlin ?Q-4-5's?

[Young Zee]
Yeah, yeah
Niggas live for it, niggas die for it
End up on the run, with thirty-five warrants
Ya boy will get'choo shot with'cha gun
Leave you layin there screamin at the top of your lungs
Zee rob white guys with nice lives
I'm tight cocked, only mess with girls that got five jobs
Those cats wit'choo sit around and they laugh
Those same niggas get you for a pound and a half
Beef start, better keep the spark
'Cuz a fool and his money will soon depart

Chorus: Zee (Outsidaz)

I'm tryin to keep money (Keep money, money, money)
Deep money (Deep money, money, money)
Weed money (Weed money, money, money)
Leave my seed money (Seed money, money, money)
I need trick money (Trick money, money, money)
Quick money (Quick money, money, money)
Get me real rich money (Rich money, money, money)
I need... (Money, money, money)
I need... (Money, money, money)

[Yah Yah]
Yo...
You on the frozen budget, I'm holdin dutches
Anything I wanna do, I goes and does it
I'ma shine like a pile of golden nuggets
Catch me in GQ posin rugged
Nasty fellow, pick my nose in public
Wipe the snot on my clothes, shockin the hoes
Chillin with Chris, smokin pot in the Rolls
For the love of money, I'ma stay down
Trade pounds, and jail bound
Bringin drugs on the Greyhound

[Denzy]
Yo yo
Aiyyo, Denzy, Benz Jeep, ten freaks behind me
(I like) M-P's and rhymin
(I like) M3's and diamonds
(I just) empty the nine if you attemptin to rob 'em
Start wilin', gettin money from bricks from Long Island, uhh
Give me that paper dogg, I gotta have it
White ?liver? pockets so money is automatic
We done bought the carrots
And you still lookin sorta savage
Theres a whole lotta money out there, you oughtta grab it

Chorus

[DU]
My creation is free basin, replaced 'em
Won't see DU on VH1, you's a wannabe DJ Run
We lace blunts, peer pressure
At least take some, he play dumb
Always and forever heat wavin
Put a mask on y'all meet Jason
This paper need chasin
Roll with teenagers, smokin green acres
Smell that free fragrance, thats bomb weed baby

[Nawshis]
Keep your raps up, you'll be the king
Shoutin "Can't nobody do me a thing"
With mad jewelry to bling
Sittin chunky, then dip this honey
Pushin Excursions and Suburbans, gettin money
Its these fake players and playa'rettes
They get me major vexed
I wave a tech, have 'em comin out they Avirex
So your ?willie pad? is gettin recalled
I'ma teach all y'all to speed ball

Chorus x2 with some variations[Hook: Young Zee]
We got you lovin' our music
Niggas smoke weed and do drugs to our music
Girls like to fuck to our music
Niggas wild out and get lock dub to our music
It's no more love for the music
We share blood for the music
We bust slugs for the music
We lovin' the music

[Pacewon]
Talk about sex, packin' chrome, techs, hero' bones
And coked up white chicks that look like Sharon Stone
Washed up M.C.'s, whose styles have been grown
Like 40 years old, still pickin' average poems

[Young Zee]
And now it's on, ya niggas wanna get beat
Just bring that shit around 20th Street
Don't get me wrong, thugs come hopin' to bust
But uncock their Glock when they know this is us
And bitches, the girls keep the block jumpin'
Somebody get shot, they don't tell the cops nothin'
So keep on bouncin', rock a 3-5-7

[Pacewon]
That Biggie and Pac shit should of taught ya a lesson

[Hook]

[Axe]
God yes, cuz pain is the object
Watch 'em stay broke like elevators in the projects
Everything we did, we did it the hardest
This kid is retarded, hate all you want, we gon' get it regardless
Representin' Jersey, ain't no other state
Before the love and hate, huawk, spit in ya mother's face
Ya life, what a waste, grab a knife, cut a snake
No love the jake, I'm out to catch another case

[Yah Yah]
Outsidaz, only here to make their mark
And run around this world like it's Raceway Park
Crash and start, front, chased by NARC's
Five deep, smokin' four blunts, it ain't shit, take their heart
Never catch us, regardless of the etch-a-sketcher's
We out takin' vestes, makin' messes

[Axe]
To each is own, we settle beef wit chrome
Got niggas comin' out their Morese Malone

[Hook]

[Rah Digga]
Now it's here like anything goes on the track
Harriett step up to bring real rhymes back
You know shit is bad when the rapper can say
They ain't even in the game for the lyrics anyway
Well that's okay, the underground stay shinin'
Those runnin' for the door gonna end up resignin'
And years later, I'm gonna still be the tighter
Majority's splurger, call it all the tax writer

[Nawshis]
It's the Outsidaz faculty
Throwin' up the finger in ya magazine
My click be pumpin' more whips than gasoline
In the Bricks we knowin' for stickin' shit and havin' warrants
For the props, we lick more shots than alcoholics

[Azz-Iz]
I call it living, Iz, makin' a killing
Off these twenties, I'm dealin' feedin' my children, Jesus is in 'em
Eager and willin' to put ya muthafuckas in the fetal position

[Denzy]
Deeper then listen, when the Outz come through
Niggas break dumb fool, pull out gun tools
Makin' muthafuckas run jewels
So the ending to the story, kid
The worries bid, more niggas will get fit to our music

[Hook]
