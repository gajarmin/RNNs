[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Yeah
Jarren Benton
What's up y'all, how the fuck y'all feeling?
Yeah, I hope I don't offend nobody with this shit man
Check it out
Yeah

I used to be broke as fuck, whipping a Honda Accord with 2 spinners/
Dick stayed between your bitch's dress, no Bruce Jenner/
Igniting crack pipes with flames from butane/
Bitches used to play me to the left, said I was 'too strange'/
Now I'm getting head from Cali hoes and smoking new strains/
Ran a couple trains on foreign bitches out in Ukraine/
Trying to be an honorary member of Wu-Tang/
But I'm throwed off like Uday and Qusay Hussein/
Fuck up your future/
I'll shoot the Ruger through your Uber/
I sift through cow manure for shrooms, out his medulla/
I'll sit in the car get head while I listen to Gwar/
I'll punch through your fucking chest and kick my leg through your heart/
The illest lyricist, smack a rapper for spitting gibberish/
Hopsin never take me in public cause I'm too niggerish/
Ay, fuck the police with Eric Garner's dead dick/
I need mass quick, snapping necks like breadsticks/
These new rappers a bunch of faggots and fuck boys/
Ay, I bet you these niggas fuck boys/
Fake thugs, Gustos, CV4/
I talked to 'Pac with a Ouija board, Hail Mary/
Ay tell that bitch to shut the fuck up when the song play/
Dyslexic; throw up gang signs the wrong way/
And drugs got me having 'out of body's/
I kill a rapper, drop the corpse off in Abu Dhabi/
I'm doing donuts on a Kawasaki/
I'm with your bitch sipping sour saki/
[wtf happened here?]/
Ay nigga try me I kill you and fucking hide the body/
I date old white bitches that do mal-Pilates/
Uh, Tech'll blow you to Reese's Pieces/
Put you on a Stairway to Heaven and have you meeting Jesus/
Fuck Volume the squad, salute to my nigga, getting cake/
Catch a bitch nigga and snuff him like Diddy did Drake/
Benton! We in this bitch!

[Verse 2: CyHi Da Prynce]
Yuh... LA y'all ready?! Okay
Huh
I see you nigga's green, night goggles/
I'm a activist, I belong in a Sprite bottle/
I write novels, the last testament/
Thou said to Prynce, "you won't find these verses in Christ's Bible"/
My pistol ain't got no body like a white model/
I don't listen to rap niggas cause I like gospel/
I grew up with some Night Riders; David HassellHoff/
Who won't stop rapping white; Asher Roth
Involved with albatross at the Travel Lodge/
Niggas try to sabotage a nigga catalogue/
Your sheep ain't herd; my wolves will knock the cattle off/
Leave your whole neighborhood wet; it's raining cats and dogs/
The rest of the survivors to the casa/
On tour with nothing but riders on my rider/
Whoever knew Duna was the driver of that Sonata/
That I would have so much truth inside my saliva/
Niggas throwing shade in my face, just like this visor/
So I got some partners that're killers so I advise ya/
Not to fuck with young Elijah, cause my guys'll/
Throw the body in the trunk and lake 'em like As-salamu/
Huh, we the saviors of our genre/
Huh, to bring the youth to the truth, is our honor/
From [...] we live in hotel Rwanda/
I can't sleep cause there's kids with nowhere to slumber/
We should give Nobels to mommas and women who held us under/
I know my momma worry, from my past of life's crimes/
I still use a notepad when I'm writing my rhymes/
Cause literally, I put my life on the line/
I'm out this bitch/

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Team Backpack, What's up?!
Yaowa
I wrote this last night in my bed/
Cause they've been sleeping on me people said/
Funny cause I could do this standing on my head/
I can't stand y'all like 2 bad prosthetic legs/
Something like an OG, just a newer version of the old me/
Hungrier than I was back in '03/
Got a little change, but I ain't changed, niggas know me/
But the Rollie do shine while I'm holding up an O.E./
This thing here locked, you would think Joell a Rasta/
These niggas queer, they career's on a teleprompter/
Bunch of gimmicks, motherfuckers couldn't tell a chopper/
From a fifth, cause when I said that, they thought helicopter/
I tired of looking left and right. We made a left, right?/
And now I feel like everything that's left ain't right/
If you a up and coming rapper, here's the best advice/
Chill out, I'm running the show without a extra mic/
I'm telling you God spoke to me/
He said "little man, listen closely, I gave you most of me/
Therefore you're way more than man's supposed to be/
Hopefully you reach supreme" "Yeah?" well I said, "hopefully!"
Every track is hard/
I'll single-handedly crack your squad in half for having average bars/
What's a battle scar?/
I'm unscathed, I should smash guitars/
On your bum waves, or tangle your dumb braids for how trash you are/
Niggas probably like, "Ortiz spazzing" it's just me rapping/
In a rush, I got a mean bad one waiting on me in the meat packing/
I'm bringing keys to the dream/
In case I'm the key to her dreams and she need me packing/
I been listening to the streets yapping/
Putting Gucci stickers on my laptop, you know, G-Macking/
See skill is something you will never see me lacking/
That's a selfie in church clothes, picture me slacking/
I tried to tell y'all dumbasses/
In '07 I make these niggas step on their white sunglasses/
Now we turning to Smurf Village, y'all let it/
But Gargamel been doing barbell presses/
I'll stomp your little movement, crush your little cave/
Turn your wave to a ripple in a puddle near your grave/
I know the real you, the real you, so behave/
Without the lies and cameras you don't want that action backstage/
I'm on my real new york shit, four-fifth careful where you walk shit/
Cause you could turn chalk next to dog shit/
Where I'm from we're awkward, look Khalid, a coffin/
Spitting up your organs on your way to being corpses/
Every other day I stood around some shit that make you nauseous/
Buck 50, son cheek falling while he talking/
Dead woman walking, wish I saw the class portrait/
Shorty used to be bad that dope made her a monster/
Y'all niggas know, y'all niggas whack rap/
I put this cypher in my knapsack, nigga this Team Backpack/[Hook: Kaydence]
I got some skeletons locked in the closet (yeah, yeah)
And I've been dyin', dyin' just to find an outlet
And I'm hoping that no one finds out about it (yeah, yeah)
Wishing maybe it'll disappear but I doubt it
I doubt it

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I look over my shoulder not knowing where it's coming from
But knowing that its coming, I was bugging as a youngin'
Now I'm runnin from, something that'll even out my dumb decisions
The night I shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
Do any sins go unforgiven? I hope not
Cause most of mine were hunger driven, nothing in my mother's kitchen
Stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hitting
So the well-screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missing
So not a chef but now the cocaine forever cooking
I love kids but now I'm selling to a pregnant woman
Stumbling through the projects in the AM with a cup in my hand
Gun on my waist and, "I don't give a fuck" is my plan
You'll never understand my palm sweat
Followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and I ain't find a calm yet
Go on let shorty sing
Cause ain't no way in hell this ain't Joell, that's brave enough to tell you everything

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Fuck all that rapping, I'mma let the conversation rock
I got skeletons in my closet
The living dead live in a nigga head, behind a combination lock
When will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
The black mamba when I crack vodka, I'mma take a shot
And hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
Yeah thanks a lot, I'm a bottle-drinking nutcase
Cover of XXL behind Em, I had the drunk face
I steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
In order to clean them out, you gotta scream and shout
All of your secrets out loud
It started as a kid at my school desk
Aced every quiz but I wanted to pass the cool test
Ain't nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
And living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
So I started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
That’s when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
And more came through Crooked I’s youth
I slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
For real, bro

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I thought I had it all locked away till forever
But no memories fade away, They seem to stay
Comfortable in my conscience you live in my dreams
They say time heals it all then whys the pain still with me?

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
See the problem is, I know it all
Or maybe the problem is that I just show it all
Maybe they that thinking I should be ashamed of my actions but really there’s no remorse
Maybe the Lord will decide that I suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
Then again all it would mean is he deemed I'm much too important to focus on
We could talk about pain 24/7 dog, that’s my department
Inter city blues cruise and I’m blasting that Marvin
Skeletons ain’t in my closet, that’s my apartment
And they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
It's all bleak to me
Tell my Pop I ain’t bothered when he don't speak to me
I love you but it’s weak to me
On one hand life is short and there’s no excuse to do it
But you was missing half my life dog, I’m kind of used to it
Modern day Son of Sam, judge but you don’t understand
Me against the world, I plan on winning, know I’m undermanned
Want to see through the eyes of a monster? Look through my glasses tint
My roommates can stay here, just take care of half the rent

[Hook][Verse 1]
I ain't even gotta give this too much thought
Joell Ortiz won every war that he ever fought
This ain't no different, I'm listening, you the king of New York?
Little homie you ain't the king of New York, you the next thing on my fork
The messenger with all them rings on that horse
Carrying king's heads til I kick you in your chest
And you cough and fall into a bottomless pit
Homie, you know how many bodies that fit
When we met you said ''it's an honor, man, the YAOWA can spit''
Maybe that's why you left me out of that shit
Maybe that's why the Slaughterhouse ain't get dissed
Or maybe I'm not on your radar
You feel you ain't gotta acknowledge my clique
Either way, I personal train this beat, it gotta get ripped
You rich rappers can't respond with all the dollars you get
Gangsta rappers can't retaliate with hollows and clips
And you fashion rappers wear the kind of jeans that hardly get zipped
So zip it, I got this shit, real hip-hop in this bitch
The apocalypse has fell upon us, watch the zombies I split
The walking dead, I've been a monster, shorty, I can get bit
And never turn, I'm immune to these rappers y'all calling sick
I stomped the red carpet holding my dick
And throw tomatoes at the podium for whack awards that y'all niggas get
Then stand up and scream YAOWA then dip
And smack a legend on the way out of that bitch
Cause I don't big up the elite
The elite can get it too, you all fit under my feet
You all victims, all chitlins when a nigga trying to eat
I'll see to it, y'all missing like a wino nigga teeth
Anybody can get it
Old nigga, new nigga, him nigga, you nigga
One nigga, two niggas, a few niggas
I do niggas harm with these bars
It was brave, you took a chance like a Monopoly cards
Put that telly you trying to check in, boy, that property's ours
Can't get a W on Broadway, I'm New York all day
Yeah, that's where the boss stay
You no hear that oye?
A hundred Ricans running at you chief like Okoye
Last time in Compton I was kicking it with Jorge
I rocked with some cons out west like the boy Ye
But I don't claim king even though my name ring
And I had China in the Bay, we call Beijing
Rodeo to Daygo they telling you the same thing
Chico be in Sacramento so much he can claim king
But that's the west coast, I'm from this coast
I'll leave the king of LA to Dre, I was this close
To staying Aftermath, but lamped out like a Genie
But Dre you a fucking gangster and Kirdis you're such a sweetie
And guess what, I'm a free agent again if y'all ever need me
But back to these bars, I'm hungry, this beat is gon' feed the needy
Y'all looking like grannys ziti, zucchini out in Tahiti
On Fiji with Erykah Badu's booty in a bikini (haaaa!)
Your main chick is a Precious, my side chick is a RiRi
I fuck her then take her out for fries and a panini
I ain't a rap nigga, I'm a nigga that rap
Before this -- y'all saw the cypher, I ain't bringing that back
Why should I recycle bars when my mind is a flight to Mars?
And the force that I come across was like rhyming inside a star
With the Universe on my back, your human verses is wack
I grab my extraterrestrial testicles when I rap
And tell Earth suck it, tell the planet try it
I turn this bitch into Independence Day without the lucky drunk pilot
I love competition, constructing a composition
Of destruction, putting Destructicons in the calm position
I'm Optimus Prime trucking your boulevard, just wishin'
That a star screams so I can go on a bombing mission
You raised the bar high, I set the bar higher
You gon' learn though, inferno scorch a bonfire[Produced by Frank Dukes and S1]

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'till you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly
Your traitor is your neighbor
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth
The weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth
Still born or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones
Straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung
I'm the one

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Now make a move
These guns whistle, sizzle up dudes who got big mouths, no power
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shala is ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica with tuna
Salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption

[Hook: Pusha T]
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with the lasers under Rugers
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork
The runners; footwork
The custies took work
The soldiers put work in
On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work
Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work'
That's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with, eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second hand swepped across that pretty Breitling
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitch singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor
Gone

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Check!
Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
It’s the microphone Methadone
Greatest ever etched in stone
You ain’t getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga I’m your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I’m a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest
Let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say
It don’t matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway[Joell Ortiz]
Joey what you said, 24 right
Aight cool, I got you
I define gutter - every time I rhyme
I climb up another notch, hip-hop got my spine smothered
But I'll be fine brother - my mind hovers
Above all you jive suckers wishing, that's word to my mother
You throw a shot at me, I'm throwing a shot back
Yours is on a joint, mine's whistling by your top hat
Yeah, I'm cool but you violate and I'll cock back
Open the mac's mouth and black out like I do not rap
I'm sick and tired of niggas lying
They fifth is lying in the second drawer next door to some bullshit they iron
Y'all be making up stories the little kids is buyin'
I do everything my Penn State like a Nittany Lion
I ain't gotta mention the streets on a song
To get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong - pause
Veterans co-sign me, the up-and-comers scared
The pretty girls go, "papi, here's my underwear"
Never in a hundred years I thought I'd be a rapper
But in less than a hundred bars I knew I'd be a factor
I'm PS4 in HD and the screen is plasma
You're Atari 2600 with a weak adapter
Between us the gap's so crazy
I'm Gucci, Louis V; you're Gap, Old Navy
I get coochie in the V, you attract no ladies
You're suburb, I'm gutter where the gats go crazy

[Nino Bless]
Fuck a lecture, ain't tryna be Pun's successor
That term's done fucker, what up whatever
You birds is food, I'm about to pluck some feathers
I'm young and clever, plus clutch under pressure, yup
Who does this better
Walk around with metal all on me like the front of Shredder
I lust for cheddar you owe me
Leave holes in your vest that'll open your chest like a sunken treasure
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Dropping bombs for fun then dine in Hell during Ramadan
Whatever I'm rhyming on or whoever
I tear 'em apart; swear on my pops
No, fear in my heart, shit been through it all
Done swam with the sharks, snapped fins with my jaws
I'm all that and a bag of the baddest piff
Off of a brick of hash mixed with acid hits like sick cracker shit
Get back, dumb birds I ignore the hype
Click-clack, Yung Berged if you flossing ice
Dawg, cross me twice, can't afford the price
It'll cost you, I'll off your life
You soft, I told you I'm raw white when I'm on this mic
Still mourn at night, don't wanna see mornin' light
And I feel like I'm forced to fight
When the +Chips+ are down like Ponch fallin' off his bike
Of course my metaphors are type awesome, right
I got 'em in awe, my aura's Jordan like
What's really poppin', who diddy-boppin
You wasn't really, now you all Common and really conscious
I ain't with that silly nonsense, I really pop shit
My gun stay cocked like Biggie's optics
I stay evolving but grown bitter
On your grave they're carvin', "fucked with the wrong nigga"

[Crooked I]
I don't write I kill a pen, leak its blood on the page
I breathe bars like oxygen locked my lungs in a cage
Instrumentals get fucked on the stage
A pedophile unless I dig in the crates and fuck with somethin' my age
Forever vow, to never smile when I'm at peace
Only when I'm eating the deceased like quiche
Only when my enemy's internal organs are a smorgasbord in a feast
The Dahmer with melanin led 'em in the belly of the beast
You'll be missin' until fishermen see your corpse
I'll be in Michigan sticking a chicken in my Michelin
Ready to pigeon pitch again from Switzerland to New York
I was whipping Bentleys before them pictures up in The Source
I'm a gorillas behind these bars, on some zoo shit
Shoot you while you're talking on some news camera crew's shit
Sicker than flyin' in past tense on some flu shit
Day-old asshole flow, I drop new shit
Exclusive, you don't want it in fact
I'll have the doctors operating on the front of your back
Tryna keep your stomach intact
The spiritual you, leavin your body, he don't wanna go back
That's when the tunnel go black
I send your soul to the atmosphere
Fuck outta here and your ringtone rap career
It's Crooked I, the face of Eastside Long Beach
Put your ear to the street so you can hear my heartbeat

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Nickel, yeah
I hope niggas know I'll show up to your show
I'll show up where you go, show up to your do', fo's will explode
Shells 'fore they hit the floor, I know niggas know
I got a open window flow, I air shit out
In the D they used to call me Mayor Royce
Now they call me Clay Davis
Guess why, "sheeeeeeeeeeee-it"
Cause when it come to them words you know I wear shit out
I write rhymes like, white lines on a nose tray
Ice cold Ice Cube flow like O'Shea
Ridin' shotgun with Chris Martin my DJ
Not the White boy, but I'm down for the +Coldplay+
Forever stay violent, better stay silent
Hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin
Speaking of, I done played a tune of violence
More than my nigga Charles Hamilton played Sonic
I wrap niggas up, clap niggas up, scrap niggas up
Either that or we gon' slap niggas up
Dump dirt on you right before I go
Into my Maino mode if I smell the scent of Yung Berg on ya
Til it ain't no mo', ain't no dough
Get into his ass cause I ain't opposed, I'm a livin' anal probe
I'm a lame-ophobe, matter fact my nigga JumpOff
Can I keep goin' (why the fuck not)
When I was a teen, I used to pack a three-eighty
Now I'm spittin sittin' between Shady and Jay
I pull the jeans down on my bitch and then wave
Cause the pussy Max B wavy when she ain't shave
I leave the booth smellin' like somebody ain't sprayed
I would talk about Kimbo but I ain't crazy
I'm like Marty McFly goin' back in time
And dissin' his momma nigga you can't fade me

[Joe Budden]
They say he a bastard for real, then they see the ass on his girl
So they wonderin', why's he so mad at the world
I take it out on tracks, I R.I.P. it
So even to the producer it's hard to I.D. it
Bars tremendous, it's in your best interest
I insist your men just, do your best Bush rendish
Endless, move more than two inches
My blood'll boil like I got a big skin cyst
So end this or see me mañana
Or see the speed of a llama, underground prima donna
That ain't hard to find, pop a E in a Honda
With hands like E. Honda, he a monster
I love war, it's like my pet peeve kinda
But for us to even beef you should be honored
My dick gettin' hard, I see vagina - pause
Nah, rewind each line each time
Speak mine and meet nine, mano-a-mano
When it rains it pours, grab a teflon poncho
You now fuckin' with Mouse, the head honcho
Nigga I could fit your house in my condo
I walk around like ratchets been legalized
Just me and the Desert Eagle, and an eagle eye
Closed casket, now you having a boxed wake
Zipper over your head, dudes callin' you Crotchface
So y'all could bump "Swag Like Us"
But the next time rap's discussed, add this as a plus
Don't nobody hit the pad like us
And would get up in that ass but the fag's might bust
And since poppin' tags is a must
I hit the bank all I do is withdraw
Chicks removin' their drawers now, your crew is in awe
How you ball, your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
You gon' need another processor, to process it
I'll set it, I said it
So keep running around hot-headed, 'til you get hot leaded
Til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
Digest it, niggas is pie-thetic
Rap what you can't afford, y'all must got credit
All you gotta know is Crooked I, Royce, Bless and Joell
With Joe spell, NO L[Immortal Technique]
New to the world, fresh out the barrio
I was an outlaw rebel out of my mind, young, and wild
My existence defined in one word: survive

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
If it could be sold, I can sell it, If it can’t, that’s cool
I’ll fix it up make it look good enough to catch some fools
It started when I was young with my genesis games
He traded me John Madden for--I don’t remember the name
But it was weak though, the streets though, they play with perico
So Tito became my hijo, he had cheap blow
And each O like three, four times, I flipped ones
But it’s evil, the people I deal with'll stick nuns
With big guns, the diesel that diesel never change
The custies still nod like they agree with everything
The weed ain’t the same, all the colors is new
It ain’t just green, the haze is purple and them berries is blue
I don’t care if it was pink, as long as they still smoking
I had them bags packed until they damn near open
The hustle’s in my veins, I could bleed in a pot
And make a soup that’d go for 10 dollars a pop

[Immortal Technique]
In la calle, on a collision course with incarceration, consumed by the lies of the streets, they were an illusion but I awoke, caged like an animal

[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]
They got me locked in a cell where I’m feeling like an experiment
My spirit sharper than lasers they used to build pyramids
Writing on the walls keep me sane
Knuckle push-ups on the concrete, till I bleed out the pain
Thoughts of my freedom lingering in my brain
I’m stronger and much quicker I appreciate the gain
Building with my a-alike, brown power reunite
Tattoos of my flag, PR pride Jesus Christ
But I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy
So when I’m free I’ll teach and spread the speech
Of how they try to divide us (to make us weak)
Find us (and break a piece) So I gotta
(To make a peace) honest (I play for keeps)
This is the life of your forefathers that fought hard
Four corners of backyards, power in numbers
So they subtract us and add bars
If they want it, we gonna take ‘em to war
We not a gang or a clique, we Young Lords!

[Immortal Technique]
I came to my senses, un esclavo no soy, that is not my past, I came to know me and my people, red brown and black, helped me paint the future

[Verse 3: CF]
The world got a template, to turn us into inmates
Caged in a state pen, man, fuck going to Penn state
Bonded to slave ships to punch in your timecard
Walk my oasis spacing jungle behind bars
Got my epiphany like Malcolm X
Prison to the bricks, but I’m stuck in this global house arrest
I’m a free man so I changed my mannerisms
This Greenspan system wanna dent my activism
Estilo machetero get my people out the ghetto
21st century Grito De Lares estate quieto (stay calm)
We vocal minorities, no pookie man trail
Guess the local authorities to be the Ho Chi Minh trail
From robbing bodegas and boosting like low-lives
The medium figures choking the four five
Revolutionary gangsters in your presence
Trying to dead us with cancer, through chemical testing!

[Immortal Technique]
Unidos por fin! We seize the time, free at last, learn to love, live to fight, not just for me, but for others, teach the new blood, and live for freedom!

[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]
I survived the COINTELPRO assassinations
AIDS epidemic crack era fractured a nation
The interpretation of American democracy
Is best exemplified in its foreign policy dichotomy
I live a double-life of political philosophy
But revolution follows me, the struggle for equality
Against the morally bankrupt, claiming to be born again
It's a civil war again, like MS-13's origin
Banned ethnic studies claiming our culture will swallow them
But you can’t conquer people and build a country on top of them
And then feel offended that they breathe the same oxygen
Your family values lack the wisdom of Solomon
But Operation Condor and Operation Bootstrap
Are Poli Sci 101 research for the New Jack
It’s hard to reach, Communist Utopia tomorrow
When your hands are in a fucking glass jar like Che Guevara
Forget the distorted historical facts you were given
Slave trade was the capital for capitalism
Trapped in a prison mentally, dying existentially
Separated from people you can’t see yourself to be
Then racially integrated into a burning house
Colony of an empire, economically burning out
Can’t win a debate, so they sponsor every threat to me
I wonder if Agent 800 is standing next to me

[Outro: ?]
In Puerto Rico, the main problem we have es que somos colonia, we are a colony, we are fighting for freedom, because we will not be a slave nation [?]. The struggle here is to make universities the struggle here is in the community, it's against the police and violence, it's against discrimination, it's against the crime against humanity on this beautiful Caribbean Island. This is ? Young lords, revolutionary always, from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Que viva Puerto Rico libre![Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
Cry first and laugh last
Television was on, we never had Dash
And the city was flooded with mad crack
Cause they experiment on minorities like we lab rats
Priorities, it's fuck authority
A man that can stand on his own and show maturity
I ain't ever ask for a loan, I've been supportin' me
Takin' cash from hoes like a sorority
Oh yeah they comin' for your life
[?], I'm comin' for your life
It's bonded, I'm livin' out of spite
You ain't bleed then it wasn't worth the fight
I'm givin' y'all bread and water, ah bread and water all they get
And it ain't shakin' no hands, so fuck your politics
This isn't makin' a [?], I burn a lot of bridges down
Then I played in the ash like fuck your following
All we ever wanted was good pussy and credit scores
Their own cars is better than all our rentals are
I'm sick of y'all, dudes switchin' and gettin' hot
Like Bruce Jenner and menopause
Ain't never told us detox the senators
I say they sent us to detox the criminals
So the minute that we pop his genitals
Emilio ain't gon' ever fall, I told y'all

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz]
Everybody pressin' charges, they ain't change where I'm from
It's no game, even Ndamukong Suh
Connect try to keep me out the loop
It's canine proof, all my birds in the coop
Niggas wanna see me in the cage, but why?
My lawyer gets surprised with the money I save
I'm low like Fetty Wap's left eye
I coulda sworn I saw Left Eye at Best Buy
Nike slippers, read the paper on the milk crates
Sippin' Arizona, I got stripes like a Zebra Cake
Believe me, fast money like a relay
Shopped in SoHo when Prince Street had replays
[?], I love my heritage
And fuck the race, if you real you my relative
Why so sensitive?
The revolution will be tele-vized
Excuse the grammar, I'm a ghetto kid
My grandma still alive and all 11 kids
Only my father made it, let's reminisce another time
Bought a watch with these bars to kill time
Sick in the head, now that's an ill mind
Shine like a d-d-diamond [?] young
I said one day I'd have a Lambo, not a Hyundai
I kill for these stacks like Jimmy Caan
Wait let a G win like the Padres
Let a G win like Tony's last name
Who played first base for San Diego
Had to break it down
Fuck the cops, we gotta triumph
Fight for Freddie right now, it's about to be more riots
They wanna kill the youth when they need more guidance
With more violence you can only expect more defiance
It's hard to be vocal when they shoot you up and choke you
Die unexpected if the wrong one approach you
Sharpton ain't doin' enough, where's all the leaders?
Breakin' the same laws, we follow how they teach us
I never seen a thug win a million with Regis
Or a single mother from the ghetto either
Fuck y'all

[Interlude]
It's a small island in the Caribbean that we be in
Goes by the name of Puerto Rico

[Verse 3: Chris Rivers]
Nigga the champ is here, Cassius Clay in his prime
The Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawking of rhymes
Combined with Einstein's mind and then refined like it's wine
I write divine rhymes, I fill my time by feelin' these dimes
Fill my satisfaction with valid rappin' and Magnum wrappin'
Fact I haven't felt emotions that's potent since daddy's passin'
I'm the Marilyn Manson of [?] relax in baths of acid
I got True Religion jeans, if I kill you it's act of passion
I'm a dragon from [?]
Aptitude is ample to pass all the rap masters
Who master it, cracking ribs
Put you in the earth, what it's worth you can act natural
The pragmatical mathematical rappin' cannibal
Who fight with animals, Bronx nigga that has an attitude
You see my avenue is compatible with a battle room
I never sold crack, just wrote dope lines to hand to you
Package that, I got the Cadillac of flows
Cataracts these hoes cause I'm soundin' like platinum gold
You never see a ghost, that's what me and my dad was told
So now I'm pickin' up the torch while these labels haggle my soul
Y'all can suck the undercuts of my nuts while I take a shit
Only spend nights, I don't gotta know what patience is
All you niggas bitches, to exist you gotta take my rent
Blow your fuckin' head off clean bro, save the witness

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Latino, I'm that and I'm proud
If you don't know us, let me tell you about
Niggas that slam their dominoes loud, let you see copy
[?]
Cherry coco, peña drip 'til your teeth sloppy
Hustlers become connects when they need papis
Lease a Honda, Chevy on the back block
Runnin' routes with the bow bow in the stash box
When I speak it's chop yaow, I'm a New Yorican
Calderon on the phone, I'm in [?] creepin'
Y'all hangin' on resorts to just chill
I'm in the casa, rios take a walk down the hill
One way in, one way out, where y'all all could get killed
Leave them niggas alone, that's how the officers feel
Nigga, my people, beach, 98 gettin' our tan on
Slippers walkin' on [?], hittin' the sand strong
But plan wrong, it will transform
Wet you then find a Jet Blue out to San Juan
We don't look for parties, the party's wherever we go
Turn the corner section to the 4th of Julio
Too much to fit in one 16
So let me cook like the festival on 1/16
Mean, my career's been like one sick dream
A nightmare, scary how I does this thing
You ain't elite, I'm made of deep
God thought he was stuntin' when he created me
Rap's Bobby Fischer, nigga please take a seat
I made you in three moves: ink, paper, beat
Y'all keep playin', nigga, we play for keeps
Stop claimin' to be what my eyes don't see though
Every verse I spit, you get an 'ay dios mio'
This time with my amigos, Latinos[Intro:]
Ay yo, your man got work?
Damn man, nah my nigga ain't got shit either man
The fuck going on out here man?

[Verse 1:]
I go 0 to 100 nigga real quick
Keep it 100 man and 0 nigga, real shit
Like my favorite white girl went on a field trip
Can't nobody find her, when they do, that bitch is real hit
And they're still trynna charge a nigga 43
I mean 43, c'mon dog, this is me
My man said he's doin' a little special 38
Sell me that shake and bake, you'll meet my special .38
I don't play, I'm on the grind boy
Why the fuck y'all think I rhyme, when I wanna rhyme boy?
A nigga take his time boy
My boy is a Nine boy
Coffee grinds stamped rubber band
Grab a coffee , fiends spend their stamps
I'm poppin' rubber bands
House Boy, you ain't never leave the house boy
I'm out here with my gang
I ain't talking about the house boy
But they got some shit in common
Both rap niggas - some rhymin' some embalming
We can do it niggas
That language you tryin' talk
I speak it fluent, niggas
I'm in Ruth Chris with some ruthless niggas
They know they way around beef
Young gunners, like homey that used to stay around me
From the slums bro, don't be confused by the dumb flow
I still wire money down south to them gun shows
I just been sitting back, watching
Loading up a clip, pullin a fifth back, cockin'
Preparin' to feel like kickback
Plottin' on takin' my city back
All that chit-chat, stoppin'
Move left, disrespect, fuck a who's next?
Once I get to airin', all I care about who's left
Yooowaaa
Man, you lookin' at that powder
Rap's purest form, no soda no flour
Don't nobody want it one on one
Homey I'm a one of one
You all fucked up like a 1-0-1
Have my dog spot you like 101
Dot you with one, then drop you like summer buns
Don't fall back now, thought you wanted some
This is good sex to me
A whole bunch of fucking fun
Man, I do this with my eyes closed
I be on that pyrex with nothin' but that pyro
I ain't frontin' nigga, real shit
Yesterday I bought 500, nigga, real quick
Oh Lord, they like, 'why you still a hustler?
Same reason NBA niggas be at Rucker
A nigga love the game, real shit
I go from zero to a hundred, nigga
Real quick, real quick[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
Yaowa! It's the boy Joell Ortiz
Yo man, we at a half a brick now!
Y'all know the work is fire
HE COPIED IT from me!

[Joell Ortiz]
Wake up wake up, the first is here
Mailman hurry up, ain't no food up in here
We live check to check, the projects steps is wet with piss
Elevator broke, come fix this shit
Mischievous kids steal chips outta the corner store
Find stick, walk through the hood, with a 4-by-4
Eviction letters on your door when your rent late
You riffin like your welfare was supposed to have sent cake
We turn the johnny pump up until the wrench break
It ain't safe, you walk by and get a drenched face
Every other month you sobbin at a friend's wake
Lightin candies in front of the buildin with Henn' straight
Chinese food is a gourmet meal
That General Tso's chicken is always real
Elders call the cops cause the hallways filled
With weed smoke, so when we see Deebo we peel
Deep throat is ill from a true bird
So like two-thirds of the time we climb up to the roof, word
Pebble Beach still alive
You can't park your car anywhere, for them rims they'll steal your ride
Your whole vehicle gone by the time you realize
Somebody flossin quite often at the other side of Brooklyn
Raise your hand if you spend a night in the bookings
Bet you I see more arms than Saddam and his Muslims
It's cocaine cookin in the pot; smell the fumes?
The finished product got the tenants sellin living rooms
Every time they cop, they singing a different tune
The crack got their brain boiling like a chicken stew
Take a hit or two
And watch you go from heavy-set with a job to out of work and invisible
That's a pitiful visual but this shit is true
To be honest some of my fam on a mission too
We play lotto and hope that we hit our way out
I stopped chasin that dream, my leg gave out
Don't be mad, UPS is hirin
Tried that, after the first check came retirement
Back hurtin, my situation ain't that urgent
Felt like I got ran over by a black 'burban
Scenarios like that make me the rap Earvin
Magic Johnson, I'm Barry Bonds when his bat workin
Hit maker, mixtape of the year
Can everybody just take a deep breath? Yes!
I'm fresh air, let's hear all the nonsense
He's kind of heavy, he's gonna be hard to market (what else?)
Plus he's Latin, is that who he's gonna target
So I'm big, so is Big, so is Big Pun
And you know like I know that you know that they both get dumb
So just stop it, know my target is everyone
5-foot Mexicans, Africans that's 7'1"
I can even cater to all the Native Americans
They can dance around my fire until the rain come
I knew it from day one
It took y'all 2,555 days to say I'm a great one?
Seven years I've been proven and sheddin tears like I'm through with it
Heard a track, went back and ruined it
This music shit made my first baby moms jet
We was broke, I was workin hard on my project
I tried to tell her this is our way out the project
If I don't go 100% it won't be no progress
She looked at me like, "Yeah right, you job-less
Tryin to rap, my bags is packed, see you in August"
I had to eat that, she right, we ain't had money
But the Pampers was there and my son had a fat tummy
All I ask was a little smile support
What I get? Letters in the mail for child support
But it's cool, success is near, I can taste it
Now you know all the times we argued was time wasted
I took the hip-hop exam and I aced it
Matter of fact, the board of rap didn't know how to grade it
I'm so left with it, effortlessly
Y'all'll be left on the shelf if it was left up to me
Left y'all a while ago, made a left in the V.O
The BQE feel in the water and was left in the sea
Yeah, my flow liquid; too much H2O in it
My system, I ain't drown, I became a wave and rolled with it
I make it hard for y'all to swim on the track
After I rap, I'm the current that be pushin you back
Givin me dap's like, puttin your hand up in a hot pot
Did you not know that I'm fire like a pot spot?
If this was hopscotch, you would hop to the next box
I hop to the next park and try to block shots
On the ball court, I'm not of this element
Went to the zoo when I was 3, not for the elephants
Just for the smell of it - I'm a different breed
They should've built a cage with a stage and had a Joell in it
My attitude is not celibate, fuck you!
I'll violate your whole album with a one-two
When I was one, two
I used to take on one, two, three niggas in battles and won too
About one, two, three years ago
I had a 1-2 inch single on Rawkus that won two
I'm the kind of dude you compare no one to
Your engineer's a boxer, he gotta punch you
I'm one take with it, they did it, not me
They's the industry, it's how they got me
Pissed off, like a case of beer to the face
Great taste, less fillin, I ain't feeling y'all taste
Dude your praise is weak; seven days a week
Same joint on the radio, course they gon' say it's heat
Y'all use hypnotism, play the same beat
Same rhymes all the time got they brain on repeat
Y'all can hear me once and know that I am him
The second comin of nice, I terrorize the pen
Analyze the gems, disregard the ice movement
I'm talkin to jewels that I use when I write, stupid
When I do it, they gon' stay hatin
Cause I'mma be on top of the game, both feet on my PlayStation
You could try to find a safe haven
But it's nowhere to run and hide from this undeniable vacation (nah)
Get out the car, I'm in the driver's seat
The gas tank is full and the ride is sweet
The kind of rank you pull is the kind I eat
The only stripes you'll earn will remain on your stomach
As the weight loss begins when your income plummets
Send in the news coverage, I will make dudes public
Extra extra, read all about it!
Another artist missin, last seen in an outfit
Had to be desgined by some big name stylist
Any info please don't be afraid to dial this
718 - y'all motherfuckers ain't fuckin with me
I'mma violate, I'll +Violate+ with the likes of 50
You's a enemy homie if you ain't ridin with me
Friend or foe, answer the question or I'll decide it quickly
Feast your eyes on the rookie of the year
The uniform I wear will fit none of my peers
Jump ball is near - GET READY![Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Sample]:
"I don't know what I'm gonna do."

[Ras Kass]:
Huh. I do. Get low. Ha

Bar none, when I spit a bar, I spit a bar
Hennessy, Hypnotic, Patron
Courvoisier, Grey Goose
I grill niggas, spit a barbecue
Committing drive-bys out a grey Coupe
When I start drowning rappers, dawg, it ain't cute
Till every person in they group turn blue like they Snoop
Watch face blue, but I'm grimey duke
I like most of y'all niggas better in your shiney suits
At the hood, after hours, when I'm on the loose
Cause I hang with troops like Sadaam on a noose
So fuck what y'all trying to pass off as the truth
I done jumped from the earth and touched the Universe's roof
Crash landed back on planet like meteor
Dust off my white tee and lift Lamborghini doors
I keep me a meaty whore
Trini in bikini, apple martini whore
Y'all niggas is CB4
My niggas in CDC
Bounty hunter ECG
Dipping Newports into PCP
Give a mic to me is UFC on Spike TV
Niggas talk gangsta shit but he ain't one
Till he see that gun and realize nobody really love you
Like New York on VH1
I'm the ghetto experiment
Pop in at any son
Me and the project, project, projecting objects at anyone
Blackjack bitches, that's 21
Dare any nigga to be a dollar and see
You want the king of the west then holler at me

[Joell Ortiz]:
Who's been eating? I haven't daddy
Just been the booth's Houdini, working my magic scrappy
Industry jabbing at me
I'm just trying to keep my marriage happy
But the politics and the games driving me crazy like an Arab cabbie
Still I never quit
Def Jam's president, from up the block, around the corner
Down the street, where I'm selling it
Who said, "Joell is sick"?
Man I'm on the deathbed
I wrote this on the bedspread, with IV in my wrist
I am him
The product of a moms who got high and a father who ain't say "bye" to them
His family that is
Know that y'all can never break me
Look in my eyes, listen up guys...don't make me
Only a rookie in the game's eyes
Been doing this since I was yeeh high
It's alright to be shook
I will turn your first album into a library book
C'mon let's skim through the pages in my diary, look
18 I rock those stretchers
19 I dropped a 12 inch
Rawkus Records, that's when I hooked up with G Rap
It's nothing, bang
Y'all heard the streets feedback
At 25 I'm the outcome of everything between that

[Sha Stimuli]:
Y'all know I'm everything y'all want to be
I do the shit you never do
I feel it when you look at me
I'd kill myself if I was you
You
See, but luckily I'm not
I used to run in labels like, "You should fuck with me I'm hot."
By now I could have sold some mills and showed that I was so for real
While your roster fucked around like Lauren Hill's
Let me stop, I ain't hating on nobody
It's like the whole world is waiting on somebody
They say that I'm the obvious replacement
I just say this shit's a hobby
Lot of new rappers waiting in the lobby
But I'm coming up
Me and Joell, do it so well
Niggas either want to throw shells or ride on our coattails
Oh well
Go tell someone I'm coming
I'm sonning niggas without touching they mother
There's no one above me
I told y'all that I was a problem
Rappers started studying me like they could solve it
Listen close
I got a 9 times 5
I pop 3 times 2
Add drama, take away your respect and divide you
In half, for your math I do this til I'm through
Living life, breathing breath, I bring death to your whole crew
I don't know if there's a better MC
Some people get better with time, I say the time's getting better with me
I got, I got my rhymes tight, the streets gave Sha light
Now you see me holding C-Notes like the Chi-Lites
It's The Present motherfucker

[Grafh]:
I got unhappy soldiers, esse that clappy clappy toaster
That turn you brains into nasty tapioca
Ewwww
Then I hop back on over
To drop autograph while I'm autographing a poster
I'm in the cut like
Change stashed in a sofa
I'm Hennessy straight, you a pretty ass glass of mimosa
You a bum, I caught you trying to go half on a soda
You make the change, I use the stash in my loafer
So it don't matter what I pack in a holster
Cause I slash you till I scratch the plaque off the back of your molar
It'll cut through the back of a boulder
Owwww
Got a pack full of soldiers with a bag of explosives
And they clapping them toasters that can detach your back from your shoulders
After I blow your little daughter out the back of her stroller
And the ricochet will blow her back in the stroller
Cause that gat caliber has the motor out the back of a roaster
Vrrrom
Get drunk and try to spaz you joker
Till I punch you in your face and move your back tooth over
I'll knock 'em down your throat
You gag, you choke up
Then I bet by the time your lungs collapse, you sober
Breathe easy
Back don't ya
I'm a crack donor
So my tax write off is a crack smoker
Aaaayyyyye
I ain't battling no one so don't bring a challenger over
If I wanted a challenger I'd battle my poster

[Gab Gotcha]:
I ain't never met a thug that my slugs ain't like
I never met one who lived or walked straight, when they all hit right
Head or the back you parents are attending a mass
Centered around that box wood, lacquered in black
With you you laying stiff in the cushion
While I'm pushing a 'Lac, past the church while your family's looking
Over your face, me driving over the bridge
With coke in a space sealed by placing a switch
If life is a bitch then she fuck me nice
Boxed up for seven joints now she pregnant, bout to birth me yikes
My first born at least, VS1
My seed cultivating, that love grow out of weed and concealed guns
Triple beam lust
Finger fucking them grams that make twins out of one in my hand
My connected weight set me apart
The potential to flood it like when Noah finished building the Ark
Colombian
Moving coke is an art
If Michelangelo was Pablo, Gab Gotcha gotta be Picasso
I rock flows and crush rocks for your nostrils
Clutch Glocks that pop when that blow make you hostile
Parce, cojalo suave, or I unload a clip
And siamese twin your head and the lobby
Silicone tips makes vests sizzle
Implants in your chest like fake tits, holes size of your nipples
Nigga

Gab Gotcha. Crown City nigga[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Joell Ortiz]
Yeah, dear Lord, why do I feel how I feel?
I could move a thousand bundles of krills (uh-huh)
I could hit the lottery for a mil', money no longer make me smile
It's wild, stress hurt like buryin your first child
I'm really losin my drive to do this music
If it don't happen after this, I'm through wit it (done)
25, still live at my mom crib, two kids
Ever heard that sayin "So smart you're stupid"?
That's me, fourteen and change on my S.A.T.'s
Chose the project over college, what a fuck up
On the block hollerin at bitches like "Fuck you, you stuck up"
But what could a shorty see in a jerk, a man when she leave?
A man when she get back from work, what am I worth? (huh?)
Then they said my pen could get me out the P's
But he been away for five, so he don't see what I see
Mom's like "Turn that down, I can't hear my TV (shit)
Worryin about them beats, I ain't raised no deadbeats
Better find you a application boy, get up on your feet"
Though Mickie-D's was dirty, my rhyme book was neat
Plus I ink my heart and soul in them sheets
But uhh, holla at me though (word) I'm so unhappy yo
Don't wanna be the dude in the barbershop that coulda made it (nah)
In a cypher with young boys spittin shit that's outdated
And them niggas walkin away like homie was overrated
Life ain't a bitch, life is life and I hate it
Never tried suicide, I ain't got the heart to pull it
Know your brain feel pain when it's stained by that bullet (whoa)
I don't wanna live, yet I don't wanna die (die)
And have God say "You was about to do it Joell, why?" (why)
Daddy, do you even care that yo' boy is still alive?
Ain't seen you since '83, hello to you too (damn)
Guess I was unimportant, and you had to do you
Sad that I had to guess, that just added to my stress
Moms did her best, naw fuck that! I don't get it
How could you just go and forget that I existed? (your son)
Guess I'm not like you, cause I ain't a punk (nope)
I don't run away from problems, I solve 'em and man up
Mom's said I got a step-brother named Jamel
A older sister as well, forgot her name
Why did we never meet? I was the only child (uh-huh)
Who wasn't an only child (uh-huh) who felt lonely, wow (wow)
How can I tell my sons about a grandpa I ain't know?
I'm done with you yo, next topic
I miss you James, I seen your daughters last month, they gettin big (yeah)
I know you surprised in heaven that Yvette had a kid (ha ha)
Wish we could sip, one more blue-y together
In that RX-7, we all smelt like gas (ha ha)
Still we hopped in the pool, shopped off and harass
P.A. ain't the same without you
Whenever me and P.O. get bent, that's my word, we think about you
Rollin up your sleeve, that's when we knew you was drunk
Remember that time your armpit had that yellowish stuff? (ha ha)
What the fuck was that? Be proud of me, I'm comin up in rap
Just waitin on my dough, you know the biz
What up with Miz? Tell that nigga I said whattup
DeVon gettin better in B-ball, his tall ass tryin to dunk
Through this gift right here, I promise to stay in touch
One, when will this bus come? Been waitin on this ride for years (years)
All my shirts is stiff, from the driest tears
What the fuck? I'm nice, the world need to know
The comments on HipHopGame say "Honestly, he should blow" (Joell)
All these meetings is lame, every one is the same (where we goin?)
I pop in my demo and everyone goes insane
Walk out the buildin, head higher than cocaine
Only for me to never ever hear from them again (damn)
That's why I contemplate puttin my pen away
But I don't, cause muh'fuckers did the same shit to Jay (word)
Coincidence? Nah, I don't believe in those
Shit happens for a reason, if this was meant, I'll know
What do I got to do Lord? My songs is tight (uh-huh)
My shows is jam-packed, I'm hip-hop's anthrax (sick)
Nobody can touch me but I'm still in the hood
How could you leave me around danger when your boy's this good?
Patience is a virtue but enough is enough
By the time I get on I'll be too tired to celebrate
Yeah I know I'm lyin, I'll wake up when I get that cake (ha ha)
First thing I'll cop is a plane ticket and escape (fly)
I don't care where, just far away from here (gone)
Turn my phone off, unfold my beach chair and just stare
(Look at this shit) Like hell yeah, life
Told you we twinkle our toes in the sand that's white
Last one to the ocean is weak
And swim in the water that's clear enough to stand up and see your feet
But that's only if, if "If" was a CEO
We'd all have a deal (huh) we'd all sell a mil' (word)
I'm talkin to underdogs who feel how I feel
Well y'all can't feel how I feel, but you know what I mean
Right now I can only write about the things I've seen
Sounds sad but, I could fit that in a sixteen
The furthest I've been was L.A. for a couple of days
Can't front, the plane was smoother than the front of the train (ha ha)
But anyway, everything ain't okay
I'm tryin live for today, but tomorrow's a repeat of yesterday
Same shit, different Pamper
Another letdown, but they disguise it this time with a different answer
The game's scared to gamble and they know I'm nice
How you gon' double up yo' dough if you don't roll them dice?
It's a 50/50 chance, but in my case, it's 99 to 1 (one)
The one's what I'm gon' say when I'm done havin fun with these tracks
Cause yes, it's so so easy
Like readin the Good Book in a room with no TV
No I'm not braggin, just a confident kid
That ain't reapin the benefits he deserved for conquerin this
This meanin the crowd (crowd) the art (art)
Hip-Hop itself, I am +The One+, Neo is my son
People, I'm from the bottom just like you
If you ain't from the bottom, no offense but are not who I write to (nah)
I'm the underdog's underdog, I love the odds (love 'em)
Shorty feels so much better when the road was hard (ahh)
I can't wait, literally
I'm the epitome of what a real MC nigga should be
Follow me (Joell Ortiz)

Cooper Projects man, Williamsburg, Bushwick
Green Point, Queens man, Corona man
Elmhearst, anywhere on the BQE man
That's mine man, Block Royal![Intro]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the most feared up and coming emcee of them all

[Verse]
Joell Ortiz but of course you crazy?
That kid's been nothing but short of awesome lately
His mixtape received 4 stars in the U.K
Turned S.O.B's down several Tuesdays
Valet it up on hot 9 with Kay Slay
He on NBA Live 05
Cuz EA sponsored the rap battle last year that he won
A flight from L.A. headed back to where he from
Six hours so he copped a little something to read son
Source Mag page 66 was a regun
He got Unsigned Hype the recognition had begun
Very next Monday was XXL's Chairman Choice
Recently the P.R. Parade got to hear his voice
Now he back in XXL this time show and prove
Cuz he writing hit records and his shows improved
He's the dude you need to worry about
Three more mixtapes done he fina' put those out
Thats how he laugh at doubt
If I was you I would clear his path
Cuz everything about him say you wouldn't really wanna feel his wrath
He turned down three deals this last month
Labels playing tug a war with his name, he who they want
He signing over here "Nope", He signing over here "Nope"
The both of ya'll wrong, he grinding over there
In a city near you trying to strengthen his fan base
Layin down cuts like a band-aid
Know how many dudes this man paid, the list is endless
He carried big crates just to get in the club
And when he got in the club he gave out his mixtapes
His work ethic is great, his drives like T-Mac's
You let him go or share a poster, RELAX
Ease back give him room to breathe
All those who hated will all soon believe
All those who made it will all soon just leave
Once their fans get a whif of Mister Ortiz
He spits it raw please, don't confuse him with these other cats
He's a full workout they three jumping jacks
Front to back he's an obstacle to overcome
I mean you know nothing's impossible but don't be dumb
He grew up in Cooper Projects so you know he's slum
The only child, homie wild, he the only one I ever heard nick named the Peoples Champ
Underdog all his life earned his stripes doing things he ain't like
Like igniting the fifth all night hugging the strip serving a pregnant bitch hard white
He happy that his mom's never sucked a glass pipe
She use to sniff, getting her off that shit was a fight
Why the fuck you think homeboy go hard when he writes
Trying to make his future bright cuz his past got him tight
His cash might be light, pockets empty kid
But same time next year its MTV Cribs
He put his life on it twice on it
To make sure he can't ask that, his crib must gon' have a nice price on it
Chandalier's with the ice on it, Persian rugs with no mice on it
Huge T.V screens with classics episodes of Miami Vice on it
Indoor pool and the floor got a mic on it
Plaques all over the wall with his name engraved nice on it
Man listen his ambition gonna have the game locked like the box in San Quentin
Fin to win his race cuz he ran different
In through the nose out through the mouth
Not worrying bout his competition radio clout
Look straight same pace let them nigga's be out
They true colors gonna show later on, when they breathing all heavy and they legs is worn
Duke gone from having an ill buzz in the street
Yo yo, don't nobody give a fuck when he speak
I know, it could happen in a couple of weeks
Lifes a bitch ain't it?
But me I love every picture that this kid painted
He the difference between artists and rappers
Artists draw hits, rappers take flicks
Other rappers trace-it, man these nigga's ain't shit
Everything's ba-sic, they should claim the same clique
That's why everything he give hip hop came sick
Like the syringe in the vein of an AIDS patient
Kane spit on this BK remix take that
The kid is co-signed by the dudes who made rap
Face facts G Rap told Mike he got a problem on his hands
Mike is Joell's A & R just so y'all understand
KRS responded with one word "Damn"
The cyphers complete once he shake Rakim hand
He a one man movement
General, Colonel, Sargent, Major, Private, and them youngin's on the front lines shooting
Gun high trooping through this war with his music
And he ain't gonna stop till he drop get use to it
He speak English fluent his spanish pequeño
So doing reggaeton is a slight problemo, plus he sound moreno
They ain't know he was spanish till he transformed form quick and got his government established
But none of this matters, if you nice you nice
You could be Ethiopian rhyming for rice
You could be Hatian trying to rhyme for your rights
You could be South African writing rhymes for ice
You could be Cuban rhyming to cop you a nice, little boat that'll make it to the U.S. coast over-night
It is what it is, in this biz you live
When you die, that's when your records sales sky high
He tryin to rep while he alive, his heart still beatin'
Brain still dumbin' his nerves still tweakin'
Stomach still growlin' cuz what he's eatin
Ain't enough, bring the twelve gauge out its duck season
Give him one reason your career is gone
Say his name on a song he'll put yours on a tombstone
Not a pizza either, I'm talkin everybody black down crying to the words of a speakin preacher (Amen)
He's a deep believer, in what goes around comes around and whats coming around is dope
And what went around is his name and the strength of his flow
His ill show his radio appearances and mo'
Some things is maybe's and some things for sure
Some niggas is crazy and some nigga's M.O
Some nigga's is lazy and some nigga's just won't stop working till they get what they deserve, ya know!
That nigga is Joe E double L O R-Tiz, pa' please you one match in the snow
He's like a crib on the sun sitting next to the fireplace with the heater on a million and one
This young man is hot he'll sun tan your block
He gon' keep firing, your gun jam alot
Heat rise, expect to see this man on the top...

[Outro]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the most feared up and coming emcee of them all
Joell Ortiz what they call you crazy
That kid has been nothing but short of awesome lately[Joell Ortiz]
On a scale of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Eight, nine, ten, motherfucker I'm in eleven
I served 12 12's amongst thirteen buildings
But fourteen grams, oh man I made a killing
On the fifteenth the welfare check dropped
So it popped like the sixteens sitting in my Glock
Seventeen years old with the coliseum fronts
In the back way with like eighteen blunts
It was nineteen, I forgot the year but it was on
Cause dimes went out of style and the twenties came along
Twenty-one dollar E&Js with my crew
Cracks in my ass and the grands are twenty-two
Twenty-three on my jersey, Nikes on my feet
On the twenty-fourth bus tryna write to a beat
Locked the game like twenty-five to life at twenty-six
Twenty-seven gave you The Brick, at twenty-eight I give you this nigga

Simple mathematics y'allY'all know me, I flex muscle on anything, ain't a beat safe
Can't just go flaunting that heat in Joell Ortiz' face
Been hoping that a frog would jump, it's so much leap space
But yeah, nobody took to the air, I got their feet placed
Firmly on the pavement, nobody want it with greatness
I'm mean mugging these niggas and never getting a facelift
How is he your favorite? Them bars he give up is basic
Guess niggas start sounding better when YAOWA take a vacation
I've been running around the world with the Slaughter, but boy I'm back
Get ya papi right back out on that corner with all the crack
A couple kilos of raw, just shot a couple of packs
And a couple of y'all'll flip if a couple'll spit out this mack
Man, the whole block changed, this the hip hop game?
Sweet kool-aid running through niggas' popped veins
Must a Brooklyn enigga come through again? Pop chains
Smack niggas and make 'em dissapear like it's pop's name
This my playground, be scared when I swing through
Fear when I slide by, y'all seesaw what the kid do
I was hot when I was a baby, on fire as a young toddler
Dry ice as a teen, todya I'm made out of lava
I swear to God when I say I'm the best, man, I really mean it
Not confident or conceited, just standing here undefeated
Please don't be fooled by the quantity from these heathens
When your head is full of air you could do a lot of leaking
See my name next to it, know a flame swept through it
And that's the song on the joint where the mixtape get stupid
Got throwaway bars that could go invade mars
And I hang with the kind of Marshall that don't tow away cars
5 AM - that's the time I set my alarm
Wash up, throw on sweats, go jogging along the pond
That's what I call a river my condo is sitting on
Which house has the pretty stars y'all niggas just wish upon
You could kiss Joell, baby, just don't kiss and tell
You ain't gotta tweet me, my digits is in your cell
Please no Instagram, a picture can only tell
A thousand words, have a million positions all to yourself
My personal life is private, my public life is a riot
Write on so many planes, my pen of choice is a pilot
Diffent currensy, different customs, my body is tired
But everything is working out, so yeah, I decided to dye it
Lost a couple of LB's, no more triple XL tees
And my pythons look like anacondas, you'll yell please
If I put you in that sleeper, plot a Joell squeeze
Then tighten it to your knees, Give in and you spell Z's
You know I can really fight, right nigga?
Your man'll think I'm wrong if the right, right'll hit ya
Your face gone look like a great white bite ripture
Two evenings in a row, yeah, night, night nigga
I've been jumping hurdles since Excitebite, nigga
You probably was with your sister making light bright pictures
I came up in the projects, you niggas ain't that wild
Walking up the stairs I was crunching up crack vowels
Walking outside, I was ducking their clap louds
Sounded like a M.O.P. kind of record, click clack blow
See, stand-up niggas get easily sat-down
And the cops get there three hours later for pat-downs
I've been rhyming forever, forever been seeming short
Infinity is like a blur, I'll never run out of thought
Broke as a motherfucker, I still held down the fort
Respect don't have a price tag, some things can't be bought
I was schooled by the OG's, right up under the action
Bottom of 40 tapping, right there on Kingsland and Jackson
Dopeboy fashion, ropes, gold caps, Girbauds and Bo Jacksons
When starter hats was snapping
Funny, I'm just rhyming, y'all listening like I'm snapping
Any rapper indirects, I'll be listening like ''what happened?''
I gotta make sure I ain't gotta go break jaws
Or have my goons in your hotelroom on the 8th floor
Before this Twitter shit y'all ain't even know I was funny
Cause in every rhyme I uttered I gave you the gutter from me
I got a sense of humor, see, I ain't have a choice
Your jokes had to be fly when you came up bummy
Nope, no money, yup, so hungry
When food fell on the floor we picked it up in a hurry
Saying ''God made dirt'' and dirt don't hurt
Really, I stomach like throwing that out ain't gone work
Yeah, I started from the bottom now I'm here
Not the top, not the bottom, I'm somewhere
In the middle, not coach, not a layer
Ain't wake up in a new Bugatti, but I steer
Through these New York streets, I see clear in my rear
-view-mirror all the bad bitches stare
Guess I'm rolling smooth enough to things I'm doing in this truck
Please, no jury duty, man, I swear (no joke)
Anyway, to all my fans, yo, I'm sorry
I gotta end this verse, but these niggas know they can't harm me
Don't ever try to keep me out the party
Invited or uninvited, I'll be in there with my army[Intro: KRS-One]
You know it's Kris!

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they running this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and popping them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we popping they brains out
It's supposed to be about seeking in the seek out
You witnessing injustice, you got to speak out
If you claiming you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you running over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A hip-hop guild we got to begin building 'em
It's supposed to be no police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of our lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about making it better
You see, hip-hop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead, be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doing your part, that's how it's supposed to be
Pursuing your art, that's how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, that's how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you moving slowly
Then talking junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
I Touch "50 MC's" like Tony
Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
I spit the truth, but I'm not the only
There's plenty, K-R-S-O-N-E

[Chorus][Hook; Joell Ortiz]
Woho, all I know is fast money and homicide
I see no way so I grind
Tell me what you would do if your life was just like mine
You would have found another way
But yeah you say we aren’t the same, but why, why?

[Verse 1: 2 Pistols]
Started at the bottom, no I ain’t got no worries
Gucci, Findi, Prada, that’s all my bitch wearing
I’m industry, you in the street, ain’t no comparing
My rolex got your bitch wet cause she keep on staring
I’m swagging on these bitches, stunting on these niggas
For all of part time, I’m pouring out the liquor
My brother locked down, and I can’t go visit
Convicted, felon, so al I can do is sent pictures
Hit the club and ball, me and my girls is dolls
We do it for real no fake instagram pics niggas like y’all
White diamonds no flaw, Lamborghini, no top
I’m riding with a, china doll, and she ain’t on no draws

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Pistols]
You just gonna sit there and lie, act like this tough guy
Knowing you apple crumb pie, sat in the window cool
And you headshots to see us run by
Say mama they all get shooting, when I was at war, yet such a young guy
Too young to even be boozing, but every night I held my cup high
And slung the everything move
I was just like design my projects, get inside that letter box
Head inside that staircase, crack inside them yellow tops
The cops inside our bizness, sometimes they chilled and let us rock
Sometimes they on that picture, running through mud to try to get us knocked
What do you know about gemstar, sitting the slice in the dice
Weighting up shit then wipe, and all of the crumbs from all that triton
Going outside and risking everything, they coming upstairs and writing
I survived from luck of god, or maybe I’m lucky god just likely

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Pistols]
I came from the colder, long marijuana
Platinum plaques off this rap shit, and now I’m shitting commas
Death before the sona, middle finger to your honor
Only god can judge me, head first in these streets
Body bag d peets, it’s blood money, your bitch was sliding in the new v
Shawty where does the fish? Told her call me 2 piece
She smiled and blew me a kiss
I’m balling bitch I’m balling, turn the lights off to see my wrist
Young boss in the city, my heart cold, no feelings
My money running like emmy, my money running like fog
My money running Chris Johnson, or something like Frank Gal
100 birds, 100 words, either way, I sell dope

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Mad Max, niggas on the bad batch
Montana coke boys know we got the Anthrax
Coup white, shawty mean, long hair, ass fat
Dope boys, coke boys, hottest out
Put that on your last stat
Every shot clear block, that’s fact
Hit it then I slit it then I pass that
Fly and take cab back, balling new Ferrari with the glass back
Everything you fighting for, we had that
2 shots, fast nap
Shots are like my youthem, 2 doors, coup them
Bad bitches loot them, talk birds, we move them
Get the purp I’m used to, get the smoke I’m cali
Coke boys we styling, bad bitches smiling

[Hook][Intro: Joell Ortiz]
Another day, another struggle
Another day, another struggle
Joell Ortiz, that's me
V.I.C on this track baby, I see

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Another day, another struggle
Everytime it rains in p's, I seem to walk in the puddle
God as my witness, I don't want to hustle
But that phone bill is payed if I finish that last bundle
It's gettin' cold, and I make sure my son, Bundle
He gettin' big, can't fit his clothes from last year
That's new shirts, new pants, new footwear
New Coatward coat for me to cook yeah
I know exactly what them housing letters look like
Don't pink slips look bright on that brown door
That means you going out of business like Caldor
Moms riffin' like what they're trying to put me out for
Face to face we had to fight it like a south paw
Them case workers to busy runnin' their mouths off
We down all day from 7 to 3, just for them to reschedule everything for next week

[Hook: Joell Ortiz]
You can't fit in my shoes, if you never had to hustle
And live by the words another day, another struggle
You can't fit in my shoes, if your life wasn't real
And you ain't live check to check tryin' to catch up to bills
You can't fit in my shoes, if you've never been broke
And bang yourself looking for something to kill that roach
You can't fit in my shoes, if you've never asked god
Why we live like this, why is life so hard

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Remember that white money with the staples
The only reason there was something occasionally on the table
Remember that month you felt good you was able to turn on that cable, they turned off the cable
The next month the cable been knockin' but you stayed shush
You burned Papi down the hall to get it hooked up
My moms sent me to the neighbor with a letter and told me not to read it
I read it trying to keep my head up
Walked in the crib like ma here's the ketchup
Ran to my room, facing the sheets, I wet the bed up
They wouldn't let up, in tears that is
Wish I was there 15 years ago to hear that kid
Just to let him know that he ain't the only shorty going through it
In 15 years from then he'll be finally flowin' stupid
But ain't no time machines, so ya'll can give shorty all my rhymes
Every line is mean

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Look Mami they built an ice cream truck
Joell get your but over here you don't need any ice cream
What, that ain't the good truck that ice cream sucks
That was the excuse, Mami ain't had a nice clean buck
But listen Mami I hold nothing against you
We was all alone on our own when pops left you
And that vanilla and sprinkles was nothing special
You sprinkled Vicks on my chest and said bless you
Sneezin', and wheezin', and asthma speechin'
You ain't leave my bed side til I was fast asleep
And when I was coughin' up in the middle of the night
I looked up and you was there and you made hard livin' all right

[Hook][Intro: Joell Ortiz] (DJ Tedsmooth)
A one two, a one two (Tedsmooth!!!) A one two, a one two (Straight Face!!!)
I like to, introduce myself, my name is, Joell Or-tiz (You remember!!!)

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz]
Uh! The feet is Nike the jeans is Levi
The tee is white the fitted is N.Y
My box are Diddy the box is pretty
But the bottle inside a have you wobblin dribblin
I rep the most poppin city (New York)
The apple is rotten the blocks is gritty the ave is gwoppin
Decoys is lurkin toys is squirtin
Tuck that hurt in them boys is hurtin
We gamble wild the games get violent
The hammers loud the neighbors silent
The cameras flash the sirens flare
The ambulance ain't fast you dying there
To pay cable you grinding here
The kitchen table a white affair
The rappers spit the time is near
I'm straight hood that's how I'm rhymin yeah!

[Hook: Joell Ortiz]
A one two, a one two, a one two, a one two
I like to, introduce myself, my name is, Joell Or-tiz

[Verse Two: Joell Ortiz]
Uh! The boots is Tim's the jeans is Polo
The hoodie is Champ the skully is Solo
The leather is Pelle the AB's no go
I'll let you slide if the ball is Ocho
I'm too cool can't ruin my mojo
Don't fuck you dicks pause no homo
You talk slick you 'gon fall in slow mo
My right quicker with the force of Cotto
I write hits on my thoughts I'm oh so
Starlight like a toss from Romo
The theater is wack we bootleg movies
Too much for packs the moves is Lucy's
The broads is bad with awesome fatties
It turns you on when they call you daddy
The butter is shower the high is sweet
The love is yaowww and you like this speech

[Hook: Joell Ortiz]
A one two, a one two, a one two, a one two
I like to, introduce myself, my name is, Joell Or-tiz[Verse]
Bars, bars, bars
I got y'all with those by far
Above par repertoire, bizarre
My assembles scar your garbage artists
Come learn who I are, it's the boy from PR
Brooklyn veteran, ex-drug peddling medicine by the jar
Turn booth super human, hear me roar
Start a stampede with YAOWA and a jungle, fuck a tar
Yeah, man, I fuck up the guitars
Beat up any drum barehanded like a paw
Million karat diamond rhyming trying to find a flaw
Better off trying to find an undiscovered dinosaur
And an unidentified flying object flying off
When they seeing  a yeti taking selfies all aboard
You niggas look bored, wanna see a monster? Well, come on
Sarom play the horn, I transform like Con
Edison, better than whatever you niggas is on
I can't stomach you niggas, kettle corn
You design an umbrella, can't weather the storm
I'm pure toxic, rain pouring in metal form
Magnetic maggots, out-rap you faggots
With the track playing backwards and the ProTools crashing
Why you look surprised like you don't know what happened
When Ortiz decided to do a little bit of rappin'?
Brainwaves blacking, anything whole in front of me turns fraction
Friction to fraction
Listen you freaking frat, you're no match when I'm spazzin'
So nigga fall back, hope you caught that
Anyway I'm back in my groove like a zipper
Move like a wizard, full of hot air in your balloon, it's a figment
Of your imagination, I'm smooth as the witch that gave Judy Ruby slippers
No place like home, booth and some liquor
Preferably Patron, nickels don't mixture
I'm out here getting money, I'm a bad honey twister
Fucking on somebody mother, niece or little sister
You niggas got hot, caused a few blisters
Those'll get popped every time I drop a sizzler
Man, you can't be serious acting like the Riddler
Dressing like Robin
Matter of fact like Robin after he left the 60's
As a young boy I wanted the Ac Vigor
Got a little older, wanted a black Six
I'm back to the act bigger
Not the car, I just act vigorous on my matte blaxk GSXR
Carry the .25, now my pat pats bigger
Clap you and detach that ligger-
Ment from the rest of your body, you mad disfigured
This album is gonna be dangerous, the artwork is a hazmat picture
But I don't wanna talk, I let the work speak
I make the internet flood when the verse leak
So motherfucker here I am
This next solo album for the fans, fuck a first week[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
How many times I gotta tell y'all I'm second to none?
No magazine's top ten cause I'm negative one
So I don't pay attention to them dumb folk
Cause I'mma always be in first like the clutch broke
I'm from where the cut-throats cut coke
Cause school ain't cut it, they cut out to puff smoke
And guess what? That's who I hang with
So when you speak Industry, I don't know the language
But play a beat and I'll show you why I'm head honcho
Y'all gettin' away with murder like the white Bronco
Bunch of trash in-between hooks
Bars too cute to be gettin' all these mean looks
Put the hottest rappers all on one stage together
See who'll hold they arm up like Che Guevera
I rhyme hotter and I say it better
I'mma win the Cold War: I'mma product of the Reagan Era
Dave Dinkins of the page inkin''
My 16s free y'all, I'm Hip-Hop's Abe Lincoln
Fam I don't know what they thinkin'
These niggas got me fucked up like I spent all day drinkin'
I'm a boss, not a loss yet
You're little lemons in a race with a souped-up Corvette
I'm so hot I could stand still and pour sweat
In the North Pole, fully naked with my balls wet
I'm a monster - these other niggas small pets
Claim they sick, but they get cured by your dog's vet
I'm thorough from my Yank' to my Gore-Tex
You're bluffin', I play poker - I'm callin' all bets
Local boy, when's the last time you all left?
I don't even know where the fuck I'm goin' on tour next
Last month Canada, before that? Europe
I had waffles out in Belguim, you ain't had syrup
Every time I write, it's another flight
Another whore with my kids on her underbite
Another "YAOWA!" I chant when I touch the mic
Another magazine spread, yeah you fuckin' right
I'm on my grind like a pair of in-line skates
Get on tracks and go bananas like a primate
Baboon, gorilla, chimpanzee, a wild ape
King Kong when he escape, I'm 'bout to skyscrape
But the sky ain't the limit
I could teleport through my mind any minute
Take you to a place where the lions go "ribbit"
All the frogs "roar" and the fire is frigid
I'm outta this world, don't belong here
What good is heiring the throne if I taught you from a small chair?
Family, you niggas got it twisted
Flow out of the box, yours chicken and a biscuit
Give me Chicken Pox when I listen, I be itchin'
To cripple your career like a ligament is missin'
Dawg I'm on a mission like an intimate position
When I swing it's knockouts I ain't gettin' a decision
From here on, it's locked: y'all a prisoner to spittin'
Can't escape my bars: no visitors permitted
Welcome to Hell where Joell holds a pitchfork
And you burn in eternal flames for your bitch-talk
Dick in my hand: I'm pissed off
But I ain't bucklin', everyday I'm hustlin': Rick Ross
One day the whole globe will know that I'm Clark Kent
Underneath the shades on a project park bench
Superman when I grip the mic
The only way I'm slowin' down is if I blow a pound of Kryptonite
From now on I'm a bully, I'mma pick the fight
Let them pick you up off the ground when I chip ya bite
You'll become a little memory: gigabyte
Me and these beats got married, I'm Mr. Right
Little man, you spit it aight
I'm on fire, you got a little buzz: Miller Lite
Man there's so many words runnin' 'round my brain
If I don't put them on a track I would go insane
Maybe that's why everything I say is crazy
And everyday I wake up, with a naked lady
With a V.I.P. band on my right wrist
Pants on the floor, J.D. with a slight sip left in the bottle
'Telly key on the nightstand
I go to the bathroom to pee, and then I scram
I live the life of a rock star
They ain't wanna let me through, so I became a cop car
Put the sirens on every time I touch a pen
Everybody move like dope: that's a fuckin' '10'
My peers know I'm gonna win
This music's like my first crush, for years I wanted in
I'm here. Oh boy will you taste the wrath
I'mma make it ugly like what's underneath Jason's mask
I listen to a lot of mixtapes and laugh
All y'all niggas do is whine like Jamaican ass
Every night I celebrate, we take a glass of champagne to the brain
Sometimes we take a bath
Victory feels far better
Than defeat; you niggas weak: Solar's Letter
I'm harder than the Fonz' leather
My worst rhyme's 30 times rougher than your hottest bars ever
I could front like a car fender
Cause everything I'm on, DJs pull up like the bartenders
New York I'm the answer to your prayers
Head-nod music, leave the dancin' over there
Project shit, ain't no mansion over here
Just murder on the strings, Charles Manson on the snare
I'm hungry; the game's like a food court
I just gave y'all a loose hundred: Newports

[Outro: Joell Ortiz]
Chea

Who feel they, who feel they better?[Brother Ali Intro]
Freeway got a voice like an electric guitar, I'm the bass to it
Walk to the speaker hold your face to it
Freezer

[Freeway]
I'm 'bout to rip it straight from the rip
Body every beat the scriptures to me that we close to the end
Listen, Kill 'em with the spit and put my boys in position
So none of my niggas got to pitch on the street
It's Young Freezer the bar spitter the big beard
From the city of brotherly hate where we bear eagles
The desert kind and we pay them coppers no never mind
Niggas still palm heaters
My hood is bad they turn teen they grab ninas
A couple aunts one mother no dad
Streets was their father figure and they never had
That's why they run up in your spot with a couple Glocks
Had hunger pains I couldn't make it to eat
Got introduced to Islam started making Salat
We in two different cities
Minnnesota and Philly
But I'm on the same page as Brother Ali

[Brother Ali talking]
Yeah Joell Ortiz, get it

[Joell Ortiz]
I Ain't make believe like some of these costume fuckers
So YAOWAH, I literally got you Brother
Ain't a hood too rough ain't a block too gutter
These rappers starting to look like them pork chops you smother
Slide me a fork damn right I eat pork
I'm sick I dine on the swine flu with every thought
Every track I rhyme to develops a heavy cough
Till it's fully blown and it turns into a smelly corpse
I'm eatin' I ain't fat this just how my belly floss
I'm on the road so much I'm build me a telly porch
Bitches be hawkin', I be turnin' my celly off
They crazy like the ass on Miss Tracee Ellis Ross
Come home early I might be in that bed of yours
Girls like me I'm sort of like a walking metaphor
And this mic seems like it kinda just might be...a gift and a curse
They give me ass and curse me out when I don't make 'em wifey
I'm on the set mic check like your favorite Nikes
A Rhyme Sayer so it's only right that they invite me
On the track with 'em. I'm oozing that rap rhythm
Could rhyme forever whatever. I'll let Ali scrap with 'em

[Brother Ali]
Some of the greatest got respect for the way that I rock the set
But you ain't seen no Jacob shit dangling off my neck
So of course, dudes around the way are all suspect
Why them Rhymesayers boys ain't break you off with a check
Wait a minute it's not that I ain't get it
It's just that I'm considerate
And shit about they way I spend it
You ain't never heard me say I'm pimpin'
I referee the game I'm in and so I play it different
I Need the deed to my home and the title to my car
Make sure that my health and my life are all insured
If I ain't got all four I consider myself poor
Diamonds to the floor is something I can not afford
You see these cats and most of them are lying
Selling CDs and packs, both of them are dying
My man Free earned that shit it ain't a costume
And I ain't 'bout to cop a fake joint to give props to 'em
You ain't seen nothing crazy on my arm (Ha Ha Hum)
My kids got a stay at home mom
Until my grand kids are straight I ain't buying jewelry
And truly can't thank my fans enough for what they do for me
Industry suits wasn't digging my jams
I tour like a madman build my brand
Soundscan never meant nothing to the fans
They ain't in it for the trends they want to listen to the man
I give 'em what I can and when I'm in the jam
I get to spittin' so ridiculous they pissing in their pants
They listen every chance that they can get it their hands
Until they wear the CD out and go and get that shit again

God damn it got me back on my rap shit
Got that home run king batting average
Achievements, no 'roids taken, no astrict, don't need it
No styles bitten, no ass kissed
Believe it
Record is flawless my respect is enormous
My current peer group is a short list
Only way I lose if I forfeit
The only way you climb in these shoes is if I tire of the throne and climb off it
Dont' hold your breath on it
Only begun
If you ain't the Rhymesayers I don't owe you a crumb
Can't no MC call me his son
The lowest ever been uttered is kid brother but that's only been one
I paved my own road to the sun
My aura glow has become
A beacon of hope the closer I come
I'm sorry there can only be one
Champ around here I am not a peer
I'm up here, you down there
Look down and the ground's near
Au contraire I hear your heart pound fear loud and clear
Feet of sasquatch
MC's are mad soft
Make their weak ass glass jaw meet the asphalt
Better hope Ali don't blast off
He'll twist your hand off
Take you in the back and saw the cast off
Can't slow him up the more he get the more he want
They steady telling me hip hop is in some sort of rut
That's cause they watching the TV and they ignoring us
It ain't my fault they fail to see that we done tore it up
I'm from a broken mold y'all are from that carbon cut
That shit has all been done before
I'm here to call your bluff
I don't compare myself to dead rappers
I'm here to write the next chapter in braille and left handed
Consider yourself reprimanded
Fresh rap shit and y'all know we the best at itBig Pun’s Back!
Big Pun’s Back!
Where all my Puerto Ricans at?
Wave your flags like that

[Verse 1 - Joell Ortiz]
Still not a player I am just here
Out here tryna crush if it’s phat
Dead in the middle of little Italy blowing her back
Now you can catch me in a cherry red 750 sippin’
On a nut cracker cruising with the semi with me
I seen this ho tryna stare
She said, “I know you I swear”
I said, “what you said your name was again?
And I know you from where?”
High school? Go thata way
Man I’m doing it, every night
Feel like a Saturday
You can’t ruin it cause
See the flow that I have put Joe’s in a bag
Like a toe with a tag
So I know why you mad
When I roll down the Ave.,
Real slow With a bad one making you guys at home look sad, but
Please don’t be like this other dude that was thinking dumb
He tried to snuff Joe, so the Puerto Rican rum
Opened him up put a cease to his fun
A couple right hooks put a leak on his gums
Reached back to the TS
Homie from the BX
But BK bees where I’m from

[Hook]
Big Pun’s Back!
Big Pun’s Back!
Where all my Puerto Ricans at?
Wave your flags like that
No need to worry to worry mi Boricuas
Yea your primo is back
Joell Ortiz the new Christopher Rios of rap
And thats a wrap!

[Verse 2]
16 but I'm not done
A few more strokes before I come
I am innocent in a lineup
In other words listen up niggas: I am not the one
Ol’ timer, new comer anybody Can get it
I'm so serious about these ones
This is how I feed my sons
So until the air leaves my lungs
Fee fi fo fum I’m a giant in the slum
Take cover when ya’ll hear me come
I’m colossal man, I squash you underneath my feet like gum
I rep the Rotten apple my squad will clap you
When they point that nozzle at you
It’ll heart attack you
Skippin’ on the beat like Pun[VERSE 1: Joell Ortiz]

[VERSE 2: Scram Jones]

[VERSE 3: Nino Bless]
Baby there's a shark in the water
Named BLESS, upstaging the top performers
Was there from the start of the slaughter
When I go off like a shot from a sawed off, this was the cocked warning, sort off*
Eh eh eh, hands off this shit
I'll off you, QUICK as the black dude in a horror flick
This, artist spits SARS every song I rip
Got fans coming out the blue like some former Crips
I'm from the corner strip, that’s lawless
You be an informant, eating lunch with officers feeding the sergeant tips
HEART, of a martyr, shit these bars I spit
Are like folks related fucking, they just come out retarded kid*
I'm guarded with an arm looking like cable in the X Force
You less than a pawn, you a checkers piece on my chessboard
N.I.N.O, real heads know
I go, harder than acid trippers bopping to techno (whoa)

[VERSE 4: Grafh]"Bring 'em up dead" - Onyx
"Statik Selektah"
"Can you say New York City?"
"Your mind is all about crime, your mind is all about crime" - Onyx
"Bring 'em up dead"
"Your mind is all about crime, your mind is all about crime"
"Bring 'em up dead"

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
We dump lead like a Brita
Mutate ninjas with shells, no Shredder, no Splinter
Hit you in the leg if you turn sprinter
We corner store bread winners, North Face in the dead of winter
Nose running, block hugging, snap a picture
I'll show you how to do this son
Turn a 8-ball into a pool table that'll fill up your pockets in six months
Twist blunts, wishing I could go back just once
Man I miss the old New York, I'll fuck around and get fronts
You kids front like you tough but you snitching
You'll do anything to get out of them cuffs like magicians
Everybody I dap will give anybody a nap
Have a crowd screaming "Wait!" like everybody is fat
I joke about it because I lived it then I wrote about it
Flowed about it, hopped on stage, did some shows about it
But I'm not these rapper niggas, dog I'm so about it
Little argument, I probably hook that's how I go about it
Word though, I tell your bird whoa, easy on the brain
Slurp slow, girl I'm swerving I don't want to hit the curb yo
That's the perks though, I get a couple bands
Ice flood a couple bands every time I let a verse go
I'm on a low-carb cheating
All this bread got these wolves eyeing mine but you'll be clinging to that bed
?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm from the home of the homeless, nobody wand is chromeless
Police try to regulate but we own this, fiends throw on loafers
Toes frozen sliding through the snow just to try to sell they sofas
Hocus pocus you disappear from all that smoking
Yellow white rock is more than potent, it's soul-controlling
And we in sole control
The more dough you fold, you scale that totem pole
The hoes grope your pole, the shooters on pay roll
You ready to rock n' roll, they ain't hopping out of patrol cars no mo'
But it ain't sweet nah
You graduated now them feds want to speak hah
What's wrong, cat got your tongue?
Well keep it shut or my alley cats'll scratch at ya gums
Do the crime, gotta eat that time soldier
Hang that up bad boy, slide time is over
I got roughed up by the roughers, fucked up motherfuckers
Escaped hopping them gates and scuffed up all my chukkas
And I'm still running but not from shit
I just been on a shitting run, nigga I run shit
You old ass niggas hating cause your son flipped
Whenever he hear that yaowa after the drum hit (yaowa)
Your slum bitch give you a cum kiss
I keep a bad young bitch that squirt, when I fuck her feel like she cum piss
I tell shorty "suck my soft dick and..."

[Hook]Brooklyn is in the house and
Brooklyn is in the house and
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care, care

[Joell Ortiz]
Yes I am on that Brooklyn bullshit
That's where I was born and raised nigga
It's 718 nigga
It's a genuine borough nigga
Greezy niggas man
Chea, check, uh
(Joell Ortiz) check

[Verse 1]
So what I ask for an ace on your cigarette
On the first and third I'm happy cuz all the fiends get a check
So what I still go up to the roof to bone
With a bird from the p's who gives ruthless dome
So what I'm still chipping for a bag of weed
And if that L looks skimpy I leave half the seeds
So what it's the second day I wore these jeans
I was chilling yesterday, they don't stink, ya'mean?
So what I get a shape up when I need a cut
I ain't woofing that bad, I can use these 5 bucks
So what I get a beer on credit, from my corner store
I be going there for years goddammit
So what I lose my re-up in dicegames
Tomorrow I'll be scheming to find me a nice chain
So what exit dinner when I don't feel like cooking
I ain't my fault I'm on that bullshit, I'm from Brooklyn

[Hook]
E'time you come around your face turn to a frown
You see us 'bout to go down *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
They won't let us in the spot cuz last time they let us rock
The party came to a stop *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
Fitted over your eyes your shirt double your size
Your belt hugging your thighs *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
Looking up and down the block with work tucked in your sock
Dodging and weaving the cops *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*

[Verse 2]
So what I ask my man for a piece of chicken
When it ain't yours for some reason it always taste different
So what we five deep in a two door whip
We gotta get where we going if you fit you fit
So what I still reside in my moms crib
Now fuck that, I'm rhyming to get outta there kid
So what, yes I do have two baby mothers
Yes they do stay two buildings away from eachother
So what I only had one job in my life
And that friday I got my check is the friday I took flight
So what I skip lines in front of the club
The niggas quiet, the bitches is always like "that's fucked up"
So what my cable box in the hood is still hot
And my whole fam be silent everytime they knock
So what I spent a couple nights in the bookings
I ain't my fault I'm on that bullshit, I'm from Brooklyn

[Hook]
E'time you come around your face turn to a frown
You see us 'bout to go down *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
They won't let us in the spot cuz last time they let us rock
The party came to a stop *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
Fitted over your eyes your shirt double your size
Your belt hugging your thighs *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
Looking up and down the block with work tucked in your sock
Dodging and weaving the cops *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*

[Verse 3]
So what every now and then I hop out cabs
Papi took the long way, papi think I'm ass
So what I cop blue Hawaiians instead of a bottle
I'll catch Brooklyn drinks if they close the Apollo
So what I got my mans shirt on my back
I had this shit for 4 months, he don't want this back
So what when we 20 deep, I act up
Yo best better be easy, don't get clapped up
So what these ain't real rocks up in my watch
When the sun hit the face this shit still looks hot
So what I rob you blind if your ass ain't looking
I ain't my fault I'm on that bullshit, I'm from Brooklyn

[Hook X2]
E'time you come around your face turn to a frown
You see us 'bout to go down *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
They won't let us in the spot cuz last time they let us rock
The party came to a stop *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
Fitted over your eyes your shirt double your size
Your belt hugging your thighs *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*
Looking up and down the block with work tucked in your sock
Dodging and weaving the cops *That's that Brooklyn bullshit!*[Intro: Joell Ortiz] + (Solomon)

[Intro:]
They say blood thicker than water
But love thicker than blood
That's all I'm sayin'
Ay, you ain't even gotta look, look too far man
If y'all niggas need the YAOWA the YAOWA's there, I'm on call
Speed dial me
Quick question

[Hook:]
Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
Are you my brothers keeper?
Am I your brothers keeper?
(My brothers I keep 'em close and I'mma keep on keepin')


[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
This shit done left music, we just fam now
Man I done brought niggas around who give a fuck 'bout rhyming
Gave 'em that look so y'all don't know but that's your man now
My shooters is yours, extra hands out
But not a hand-out
Nickle, you had me feelin' fly up in the No Fly
Walkin' through that Motorcity Inn like I was multi
Goons on both sides, somebody sneeze that nigga daddy wear a bow tie
And Crook, I'm always comfortable on your side
Sauce you a Boss, Horseshoe what it do?
C-Style hold ya head, Tray Deee can’t wait to meet you
And Jumpoff, when that whole shit jumped off, I ain’t gon name no names
But yeah I hoped that I ain’t come off grimy but dawgs I fuck wit them niggas that’s why I never threw my gloves on
Needed to clear that up ‘cause that shit been really botherin’ me for dumb long
A nigga say something I’ll run in that nigga’s mouth
To everybody you Budden, to me you my nigga Mouse

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Ring the alarm, we set the world on fire, oh yo!
Chemistry you never seen before
We the four, Well-known plus worth knowing you niggas either or
Even if we was poor never seen a tour
And Eminem didn’t put our CD in a convenience store anymore
We can still hit the streets and score
I help us finance our dreams on a triple beam
Never bicker for simple things
Loyalty is royalty with these Shady royalties
I will loyally help you pay all your lawyer fees
It’s much deeper than the art of rap
It’s realer than me signing a few autographs
Rocking my new slaughter tats
I was raised to keep it G since snap Starter hats
And bury our enemies like artifacts these are the facts
Like Chinese food in the fridge we a cold combination
Slaughter slaughter my whole conversation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9"]
I'mma be mad cold and I’m cut this way, no matter where I’m at
It’ll be black roses on Mother’s day, on they mama front door mat
You know I'm, I’m quick to jump in front of fire in the line of fire
You ain’t got to ask what side I’m on I’m going homicide
May I simply cease to exist if I should be a bitch
If you should die and I should stay behind we actually a switch
As far as passing you a chick, you get the alley-oop you ask for the assist
This is a fact, it’s more than rap to me it's
More serious than holding a loaded gat to me I sold my soul to a bottle of Patron
And my favorite uncle died of an illness alchy related then he stole it back from me
And now he up in heaven like neph, you owe it back to me
I was taught that too much talking will make you fall faster
My actions show that I’m real I ain’t got to broadcast it
I called you and said that I had to fall back I had to recover
And here we are, that’s for my brothers

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Look, the love I got for ya’ll goes unsaid
Was there when me and shorty unwed
For that I’m always down to pump lead
We formed a bond against the cowards
Only grew over time in the studio for hours
And tours with no showers, and towns I never heard of was no small fort
But we was all sports, Slaughterhouse t-shirts in our ball shorts
Quik all that other shit, thats just other shit
Love is love, we ain't even gotta discuss this shit
The part that's sick G?
My brothers love me so much, I think their punch hit ya’ll harder than it hit me
Four of the best in the world, I put a M on it
And if that ain't enough I’m putting Em on it
We back to hogtying beats up and stepping on it
Back on our old shit just like Nino Bless is on it
Crowds screaming, the fans can get excited
And oh, as far as that question? I won't even dignify it

[Hook]
