[Verse 1]
Bad boys making moves like a magician
Always on their hustle like a tactician
See the streets, me I say you be average man
One blood, one nation, African eh
In every corner, boys dey smoke dope
Too much fighting, boys dey stab
Boys dey cut throat
Watch wetin' you dey talk
Cause dem fi tie you rope
Cause this community we dey
We no get hope eh
Cause the streets wey we dey
Kidnapping and killings dey happen everyday
Corruption and cheating dey run through their veins
The kind gun dem dey carry
I say na main eh
But these streets wey we dey
Like every night we dey pop champagne
Bear, alamo­ and even rose'
Too much money I say we dey troway ye
Owe! Ikwerre meka o!! dierli(x2)

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Borokiri to Mile 1
Blue and white buses I dey hail, carry on
Na oil money we dey spend
We dey deal with drums
Bolle and fish

Na D Line boy wey I be
I dey hail all d hustlers 4 Garrison
Diobu, Waterlines, Rumuola, Artillery
G­RA, Elekahia, Rumuokur­ushi
(abobby,wida na?)
Cause the streets wey we dey
Kidnapping and killings dey happen everyday
Corruption and cheating dey run through their veins
The kind gun dem dey carry
I say na main eh
But these streets wey we dey
Like every night we dey pop champagne
Bear, alamo­ and even rose'
Too much money I say we dey troway ye
Ahh kal­abari eh, ye ye eh (Ibote)(x2)

(Chorus)
[Knowledge]
Gone are those crisis and killing
Political warfare,what a pollution
That was affecting the life that we living
It's beautiful what we turned the city to
No more criminals, now we living cool
And it feels more original
And errybody on the struggle
Keep your hustle tight
Forget the struggles and worries
Always be humble aight
And God knows there ain't gonna be any helter skelter
Am so proud to be a son from the niger-delta

Caman pochichon..[Verse 1 ]
She used to hang around the corner
She always looking at me
Everybody wondered
Why her clothes were always dirty
I approached her
I came a little closer
She said that her life is bad and bitter
Don't bother
She's coming from a broken home
She ain't gat no money
Lord save her soul
Then she said to me

(Chorus)
I don't care bout your money
I don't care where you come from
Whether Naija, United States or na London
What I really really want is a home
Cuz I ain't gat no mother
I ain't gat no father
I'm an orphan, ye
She said she's an orphan, ye
She said she's an orphan, yeah

Uh, cos everyday she's struggling
She be hustling
Day and night
I don't think you know how it feels
When you're an orphan yeah

[Verse 2]
Yo! she needs more than miracles to stop the pain
But she's scared it might come again
She gat no place to go
Uncles took her home
So she had to run away
So so beautiful
It's a story I gat to listen to
Additional, her parents she be missing too
Her parents were killed, shot
Before she finished school
See, me I dey vex every time wey
When you wan rise
Dem go wan stop your shine eh
Wanted to be a doctor
To be the finest
Have a family and a good life, Kanye
West, yes she went
She ain't looking back
No, she ain't minding her steps
Then she said to me
"Slim, this my year
I'mma come again like an idea"

(Chorus)
I don't care about your money
I don't care where you come from
Whether Naija, United States or na London
What I really really want is a home
Cuz I ain't gat no mother
I ain't gat no father
I'm an orphan, ye
She said she's an orphan, ye
She said she's an orphan, yeah

Uh, cos everyday she's struggling
She be hustling
Day and night
I don't think you know how it feels
When you're an orphan yeah
