[MC Ren]
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

[King T]
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!

[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

[Defari]
Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Chorus

[Outro]
In L.A

That's how we ride (4X)[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!"
Cause her son bust a slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rythym of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever thinks that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches, they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin', what I'm sayin's for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed
My appetite for destruction

" .. you guys know who I'm talkin' to .. "

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
The Appetite is tremendous - so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought cuz I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm de kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went BANG [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, cause I'm hittin' like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets so therefor
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hittin' down the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cuz that's what it's here for
I shoot down a milion niggas and shoot one more
And that's the milion and one
They couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they was'nt rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up de asses appetite for destruction

[Interlude]
"Cops put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you. White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you
[Imitating white person] Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest."

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin' -
I possess to 10 commandments of the Hip Hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer :
First one -
Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one -
Allwayz gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snack crack and pop
Number three -
I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any foolz tryin' to cause some statix
Number four -
Here's what's the score
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth one -
My kill has just begun
I pull out my gun that will keep me on the run
Step six -
Hmmm, it's kinda tricky -
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E -
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight -
Make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth one -
I gotta be raw, fuck any brain once your man made law
Last but not least, I must be real -
Number ten - is my appetite to ki ...[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
Welcome to Los Santos
Gyeah
Where it's easy to catch a case
One times patrol with a pic of ya face
Fo' deep in the Lac, that's jack mode
Unaware of the set-neutral dress code
Drive-bys tryna pull grand theft
Bandanas on the antennas, neighborhood deaf
Rats fucking niggas for ends, bitch please
Easily friends turn into enemies
Tryna check a couple dollars but it ain't long
Jealousy in shots if the weight wrong
Stay strong, die well
Growing up in the hood's no fairytale
It's Mad City and can't y'all tell
Welcome to the city where it's dead or jail
Steady eating good, we pull licks
Staying deep like OGs in jail pics
Gyeah, welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Straps, a couple birds in ya hand
Gyeah

[Hook]
Welcome to Los Santos
Welcome to Los Santos
Welcome to Los Santos
Welcome to Los Santos

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yea, where it's easy to get some weight
Hop in the stolen whip and I'll take you straight to the place
That grand theft and robbery mask draped on my face
A cold bastard, closed casket seal my fate
For this almighty dollar dollar
When we dealing what we do you know we do it proper
And all these doctors and psychiatrists can't save me, I'm crazy
Everyday these Los Santos streets gon' pay me
It feel good don't it?
Kush smoke and west coastin' on every hood corner
I drop the top at the beach
Heard it's fun in paradise, yo that's the word on the street
Don't let these palm trees and bitches get you swept off yo feet
I'm staying blazed in these sun rays
Evil seeds getting paid, cradle to the grave
You can try it if you want, it ain't a thing sweet
The weather's fine but it's cold on these rough ass streets of Los Santos
Welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Put a bird in ya hand
Welcome to Los Santos

[Verse 3: Kokane]
Don't get fooled by the palm trees
Fly ass bitches and bomb ass weed
It's real over here on these cold streets
Triple OGs stay about that cheese
Los Santos
We be doing the most[Intro]
1999
The world's at its end
Fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my 9 put it on my chest bust some cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm coming from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' back
Can't fuck with Eazy
[w/ Kokane - several times]
Wet 'em up

[Verse 1]
This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words
Before your ass gets smoked, it ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nike's
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker
Slippin' takin' two to the chin
I'm on a role two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end anothers life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now nigga tell me, do you have any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise, to get faded of the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught
Trippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
To many lives took
To many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from
The innocent little ones
But where I come from
We take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the 9 and I'm pullin', straight creep
Feel I need to take anothers life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low
So I'm not seen, case I gotta get away
Gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right took my time and I picked him
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squill when I stuck his ass
I had to grin cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' some what relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word

[Hook][Eazy-E]
Perched up high on a roof top
Like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
A black hood covers my face
And death flows through my mind at it's own pace
Sometimes I feel like a super hero
Urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
Now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim and then my thoughts fail
My minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put finger on the fit and then the side a check
I make the kill here's the deal
After the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
So it's the shots that sing out like a piper
Everyones scared I'm the neighborhood sniper

[Hook: Cold 187Um & Kokane]
Sum'ady, sum'ady, sum'ady run up get a lick lick
Everybody else I'mma shoot to kill
Bum bum﻿ bum had to murda 'em, bum bum had to murda 'em

[Eazy-E]
So my boy is a snitch
I put my gun up to his head
And simply scared the bitch boo
Being the E ya know I'm thinkin' devious thoughts
Take off ya clothes nigga and here comes a plot
His bitch was scared she made a move I pulled the trigger
Now the room is red
Now there's nothing left but a snitch
Here's a four leaf clover punk make a wish
One [*Shot*] two [*Shot*] three strikes your out
This nigga is dead and now I'm lookin' for a window to get out
I made my escape the cops chase
Duckin' to an alley so they don't recognize my face
The boy had to pay the piper
So they all stayin' scared of the neighborhood sniper

[Hook]

[Eazy-E]
I'm Doin' dirt as I continue my mission
Killin' all fools as an addiction
As the E, lovin' the game leavin' a shame
And in my heart I feel no motherfuckin' pain
Because my heart is cold as I was told
And with my A.K. 47 I stand bold
Rippin' up shit with the fury of my gun shot
Pop pop pow, as I watch the motherfucker drop
Lovin' the site as the blood spill
Take a photograph, to keep in my hard as I was sayin' calm
And never hyper as I succeed in my mission
I be a neighborhood sniper

[Hook][Dr. Dre]
The motherfucking saga continues...

[Km.G]
All hail to those believin in the real gangsta shit
Cause when it comes to the real niggas
It makes the shit that much harder to deal with

[Cold 187um]
Yeahhhhhhhh! Above the Law up in this motherfucker
"Black Mafia" for life
Down with the real niggas for life! Ha ha
Yo Sweet Talk, tell 'em what the fuck we here for!

[Kokane]
Well alright y'all, USC, Compton, Watts
The Woods! All across the motherfuckin USA
Ye though I walk through the the valley of real niggas
I should fear no man or motherfuckin Klan, hear me one
Cause I been to the mountaintops y'all
And I done seen through the eyes of a real nigga
(Yo, what you think about the real niggas 187?)

[Cold 187]
Yo, they make some of the COLLLLLLDEST shit I done never heard!

[Km.G]
Yo, for me Km.G I must give it up
To the Ruthless motherfuckin gangsters
Fear no mob!

[Cold 187]
Because you're scared mon you're scared!
Dem de pussy runnin at y'all scared mon
Bend dem silly bumba claat barber 'til de pussy claat run
BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! Keep Baby-lon on the run, seen!

[MC Ren]
The real niggas is back, cause there's too many bullshit records out
Niggas fiendin for what we put out
But you don't have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And that weak-ass shit is still sittin in the record store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rappin since the 70's and still never went gold
Our first record sold two million copies
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out street and crossed over
And after that your career is fuckin over
Because of that you're not around
So shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas

[Eazy-E]
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh motherfuckers~!
Keepin all you busters on the run in '91
Kick that shit Ren

[MC Ren]
Most niggas can't understand
And never will if they ain't part of the Ruthless mafia clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hype fuckin lyrics and the dope-ass beats
The songs will never come soft, because I come off
So don't get in my way cause motherfucker you'll get cut off
And it's somethin you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
And let me now if you wanna ride
The D-I-C-K, all day that's with no play
Cause ain't no rap group out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
With lovesongs, and that shit is wack
And that's why your ass ain't around
Cause you don't have the motherfuckin sound
Of a real nigga
(YEAH MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!)(Intro- Cold 187'um)
Yeah what's up Kokane
"what's up player"(cold chillin'in this muthafucka)
Yeah we're just go on laid back in the studio, man on this groove
And talk about some muthafuckas, that we don't give a fuck about
(definetly don't give a fuck about, you know what I'm saying)
On some fly fly funk shit, (you know what I'm saying)
Some shit that niggas bit, "what's up partner ha ha ha-
I'm talkin to you Dre, don't bite my shit
Don't bite the funk that feeds you
Cause I sure the hell don't need ya
Ha ha what's up..
Yeah.. now while we're in the studio kickin' it off
(you know what I'm saying)- on the ill tip
You know, I wanna do some old school
You know, I wanna just kick some shit off
And show them muthafuckas I mean buisness -(you know what I'm saying)
So ah when the clock strikes to six
I'mma put them hoes in the mix (hi hi hi hi)
And I'mma do it like this for them ( ya know what I'm sayin')

(Cold 187'um)

Ahh yeah ahh
1-87 chillin' in my coup dippin'
One thing I can't stand is when fools get the set trippin'
Now I was down with the gang truce
Until I found out you was gettin' ganked by Dr. Suess
Now you can get Compton, Long Beach
South Central, Watts, Carson even Pomona
You can even ran to Timbuktu
But I'mma creep through the fog bitch and I'mma smoke you
Now I'mma take you through you history book
Uh ah let's take a look
Yeah- when I first came to Ruthless I was livin' like hustler
But see you, you was livin' straight like a busta
I used to think you was a troop
'til I remembered you was in the muthafuckin' Wreckin Cru
And then I looked at an old album cover
It was you chillin' lookin' gay as a muthafucka
I could have took it any kind of way
But see six months later you were NWA
And now it's gangsta gangsta pimpsta pimpsta
But to me you was still wimpsta wimpsta
Yeah you dissed Eazy-E but I'm confused
Cause you're scared as fuck to diss Ice Cube
Yeah now you're all straight smilin'and trucin'
But remember "yo Dre, stick to producin'"
Now you say you ain't gettin' gangked no more
But I know who owns Death Row.. really doe
Yo I got a little piece of paper from someone
And not one line on it reads Andre Young
You try to diss my record deal, but I'm still quick
I'm on a mission, and I'm going for the fuckin' gift
So next time your in the place
I'm hollering 1-8-7 with my Glock in your fuckin' face
Cause real niggas don't go out that quick
So it's cool that you bit my shit- bitch
Cause I'm a baller by far and plus a G
And I like my chronic twist with some VSOP
See broke niggas can't buy it cause it costs ends
Shut the fuck up, you're just Dre's broke friend
Snoop Dogg you better get your paper work right
Because if not you'll be all bark with no bite
Yo- see we go kinda back see
But see things got fucked up when your flunkie tried to diss me
You need to go and check your puppy, G
Because who the fuck is he, to jump up and diss me
Cause I'm a nigga with a gang of funk
And I'mma show the muthafucka to keep my name out his mouth
Yo- I never got smoked you muthafucking new jack
You fuckin' around with me you gonna end up on your back
Yo try to diss me to get respect
But you sounded like a muthafuckin Redman reject
I give props when props are due
And my props to you is muthafucka fuck you
You're just a flunkie for the D-R-E
You punk muthafucka, you wannabe G
And you know I always drop the shit proper
You can ask your homies or you can ask the doctor
But he don't get no props neither
I'mma say it on wax and I can say it when I see ya (fool)
Try to kick it like you got stamina
Whoop that ass like Luke did in Atlanta
Oops did you slip, did you trip, did you run
Did he have a gun, did you want some
No I don't think so (ah well)
Here's a bone you can choke
Get your ass with the mafia loc
Yeah fool, so what you wanna throw up
Cause you're broke as a muthafucka
Lookin tore up
But I'm the original 1-87 no one can do it better
So I'm out, and peace to my homie Snoop
Yo I hope you get yours before they do you- yeah
And that's realer then a juice of a duce
See some might not like it but yo it's the truth

(SweetTalk (aka Kokane) )

Boop boop be doo- well alright y'all
Yes lordy, ah some say it's like the Peanuts Gang

Now do you belive in funk after death?
Cause I do, so watch this

It's like dip-dip-a-la we got to make a stack
We can fix your funk when the shits on the flat
Pump pump you up, send you on your way
And I don't belive in celebratin' Dre day
It's like "Hear ye, hear ye! Come one, come all!"
Kokane is servin suckas at the players ball
If you come up the deal
You will get blasted
A tisket, a tasket, we throw your body in the basket
It's a wonderful day in my muthafuckin neighborhood
A wonderful day in my goddamn neighborhood
Now rollin' tip-toe, incognito

Bring it on Snoop
And your whole fuckin' Puppy Pound crew
It's the nickel-slick nigga from Pomona
Not fake like lacers
But real like 'Tona's
Snoop Dogg you fuckin cold hopped it
Did most of the writing for Dre
And still you get your troops dropped
Now I see nigga's rich
But you was in the county washing master's shoes like a bitch
Now who's been sleepin' in my bed
Eatin' my funk, takin dope styles by the chunk
Cause I'mma funky to the finish
Cause your funk got a gang of B-12 in it

Outro (Kokane):

Muthaphukkin godfather for the gangsta rap
Open up a can of words to all you ryders
You know what I'm sayin'
So don't hate the nigga
This is dedication to my nigga Eazy-muthaphukkin-E

[Yella]
Yeah, for all the motherfuckers out there
Who went down with this shit, fuck 'em
Fuck you, real niggas, dedicated to my nigga E
You know who's down
Yo Kokane, let's do this shit

[Verse 1: Kokane]
Now this is dedicated to my niggas from around away [all my homies]
I know you wake up every morning think about
When you gonna die some day, some day [we all gotta go]
Lord I feel so bad for all the wrong I've done [forgive me]
And I still can't believe my nigga E is just dead and gone, lord
Now Eazy-duz-it, duz it eazy but some times we going of the parallel
We cause [we cause] no love at all
So thank you Eazy-E for givin' us the gangsta sound
Real men comes man, for round around

[A Real Compton City G]

[Verse 2: Kokane]
Roll up a fat sac of hydro and pass it around
In that hospital muthaphukkin gangsta sound
Now I heard there was a gang of niggas that don't like Eazy
Let 'em motherfuckers gank it low down right and dirty
I guess the pen is more quicker than the trigger, don't be signing 'em
Contracts without reading 'em, nigga
Cause the industry
Is like the dope game
Always business
Never personal main
Yeah, Eazy had some scandalous days

Boo yaa, right about now I'mma got to drop some flyyyyyy
Flyyyyy, some cooooooooooooooooooooooooool
And I'mma drop the bomb like this to you

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
Now, here's another way to get payin'
I'm million dollar nigga, not the million dollar man
G, I break a bitch like class
And if she give up a lyin' I put foot into her ass
Nigga, I smoke weed sometimes with the street hustlers
But you can cope some dope wine, and toss some 40s like a motherfucker
I think it's.. I'm about to move some fly shit up
I play it from the Old to New School, trick school up
You hooked to my style like a fiend on coke
It's like the moral junky you get, the mortal junky smoke
I don't slip, but I stalk with the whip
Cause I'm vocally pimpin, while I'm proud I'm gifted
But yo, once I'm pimpin, the whores all know I got a gang of them
Who gives a fuck if she claims somethin?
Cause late at night, I got the creeps on a whore
I throw a penny at the window, she be ready to go "OOOHHH"
I wouldn't treat like a sneak, I treated her just like a queen
Take straight to the Mongareen, and did the wild thing
Yo, then I went back to the set
And if my homies ain't stossin' out, I'm takin' none of bitches
Until it's gone if my homies can't have some "Sure baby"
What's the matter baby, I thought you wanna have some?
Cause you whore, is not our whores
And incase you didn't know, your bitch swings low
Flipped into a spot on a strip, break a fool off a mega somethin'
So don't trip cause I'm a South Central player and I gotta admit it
Last fool tried to fade this, we got him ass kicked
They call me a G but I ain't never gangbanged "Gangster"
Maybe because all the Keys I slanged
They call me hustler cause the money I make
You know, why they call you a player? ---] KM.G
Maybe because all the bitches I break

[Break:]
NOW HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE!!
Yeah, the industry is the filthy and I'm all up in it
NOW HOLD UP, IS IT SLICK?

[Verse 2: Cold 187Um]
Don't worry about it, baby, cause I got a fat dick
So here we go, here we go, here we go, C-O-L-D
187Um from the A-T-L Posse
How you gonna tell me where I'm ought to be within or where I been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
How you gonna tell me that you digged me when you digged whack dumbs?
They don't wanna understand where I'm comin' from ---] KM.G
No, I'm finna blockin' the bridges, just from these broke ass niggas
Who steal the rag from the flag and comin' up much faker
Cause I say: about ten years from now, I'll be finicially stable
And I can probably take the piles on a turn, look back over the field
To see my Ups and Downs, to see the caps I peeled
And see the people who are still, down for the crown
You know, I have to give a shout out to the underground "That was fly"
So players, let's just chill cause things are better
And remember like mostly boy, nothin' changes but the weather
Cause I'm the Coldest, the Colder, the 187
The one that's known to put the fly pimp shit together

[KM.G]
Plus, me the KM.G the mega dick on call
I'm the one that's known for bumpin' the walls

[Cold 187Um]
And in the back, who's that?
A man with the style, a ranchin' ass nigga and we call him Go-Mack

[KM.G]

Hopefully you up in here with some of yo' friends, so some of my friends
Can get with some of yo' friends and turn it into somethin
I'm - fin' to walk over here to the bar and get the bartender
To mix me one of my customized drinks without the blender
Get everybody up in the club up in here off the numb-numb juice
Vodka, 7-Up, and cran-apple juice (eww)
The ladies outnumber the fellas six-to-one
And me and my fellas up in here like good one pimp, we all won
The pretty ones in here are hot like a dog in heat
Touchin they toes, backin it up, and dancin like a freak

[Hook]

[E-40]
MAN! I'm over here on super-purp' (super-purp')

But I believe you stay about your marbles and be about your bacon
Youse a player about yours and I'm sensin and smellin

Comin up in my face about the, child support

[Kokane]
Eww eww eww, takin me to court, can't work me
Most of these hoes be mo' full of shit than a Christmas turkey

[Hook]

[E-40]
Well alright ho
Boss mo', player hater hater my noggin
D-Boy, people swear up and down I'm a rocker
But I'm a soil block turf hog built for battle

Leave skid marks all on the gravel
Drivin like a bat outta hell to the hotel
Bounce roll rock skate side to side
Baby got the gin and the Astroglade (and the Astroglade)

While I thrust much cush gush knock boots with lust

Yo, so pass me the skin so I can rush it like Emmitt Smith
And then I have to come boil that ass, toil that ass
Bump that ass and straight funk that ass
I guess you motherfuckers get the clue (what up?)
Soda for the cut up, chuckies to hop to "yeah"
I maybe in your Coupé, or Jeep or your Wagon

For tryin' to come up, Gettin' caught up in the system G
It's like a game, never fit to win
So I'll see you when you get out if not when I get in (Well, alright)

[Verse 2: KMG]
Then you're makin' a nigga, aww shit, the whore gigolo flow
Quick so... what's the word?
I've just set a verse to the hoes with the Deuce on the corner
The green eyed hooker with the juice and the totters
The true black macadamian in Funk pole
Hit the whores, get quick to fade Al Capone
Let me take my hat off
And peep my Madonna, sex magazines
Freak all the nymphos I'm a pussy fiend
Ooh, Mister Mister, twister twister is what they call me

Or I'm a trip and bring K-Oss at it
Or my nigga Mack fuckin' re-up to Pimp Clinic
So, I'm a ask you a question (what up Loc'?)
Do you wanna die for me? (yeah)
Or do you wanna die for my Kokane at 17-5 a key?

[Verse 3: Dirty Red]
Awww yeah, I sit leanin' on my toners when I'm bellin'
Through the crooked streets deep in Cali' where I'm dwellin'
Sellin' mobile dubs cause I gotta make a dolla'
Feelin' drop the top of my rag-top-grey Impala
I'm jerkin' a local nigga out the do it and sharin' dirt
Got two hoes on the corner and they feeling put in work
Now the pimps, though I ships my pimp
And on the down low, too many hoes will get a nigga in some trouble
And so I'm... bumped the three wheel motion
Hit the corner quick, feeling like the Chronic stick
And get higher than a motherfuker
I got a beap on the sky pager, trick ass bitch
Put the trick on time so it's off to the next day
Yeah, picked up my mobile phone, to make a booty call
Creepin' down Crenshaw, watchin' out for the law (yeah, the motherfuckers)
Cause the police quick to put the nigga on the side of the curb
And take a choke of my burb, G
And leaves a nigga like show
But I ain't want them up, I got the dope from the street motherfuckers

[Interlude: Cold 187um]
Aww yeah, The Aftermath
Journey through this Aftermath
Kokane is here
Here goes Kane, check this out

[Verse 4: Kokane]
Now I'm comin' around, comin' around, comin' around the fuckin' mountain
Wettin' niggas up like a motherfuckin' fountain
So don't clone me, don't get attached
Cause some of you niggas' styles more faker than a Wrazzaler Match
Added preservatives, artifficial flavors
Baking soda free, said I say a fuckin' savior
Give your R&B, house Music, I'll say hell no
Beatin' Donnie Simpson where I be funkin' on the show
Who gives the funk shit like that? you know it's We
Cause G shit came from the concrete
So take a seat in the back jack, known I gots to strap
No longer will there be a white motherfucker dictating what is real rap
You motherfucking hypocrites
Bring your ass as used to promote that heavy metal shit
To the K to the O to the K to the A, to that's N-E we flowwww
My name is Kokane, never askin' the reason I ball
So Bon Voyage I gots the stack
And I'm out Schwarzeneger but I'll be back
(Funkin' you)(*Sound of Billiards' balls and a cue stick striking left and right*)

[Opening Skit: Km.G as a Night Club chairman]

Yo Alkaholiks, pass me the bambay
Cause I got more Hook-ups than Yave and the Ese
I got a 13-5 well, alright
Cause I gotta slang my funk at 17-5 a key
Now, what's up homes?

[Verse 2: E-Swift]
It's the westcoast soul, representin'
Funky like George Clinton
I'm in the house like a kitchen
Niggas talkin' shit all bark but no bite
Say, good night, I challenge whack Emcees to a fight
Bad Emcees, I smoke your head with the ruler from the old schooler
Punch your ass like Don Shooler
Hard Core, that don't rock no soft shit
I flow like water from the faucet
Aww shit, here comes the raw shit
Back the funk up, I fit your track, I stack you for the duke up
Rough and ragged like a truck
All bite but all you're bitin' is my style
I hit the 40 Ounce and then I'll get buckwild
Check, E-Swift is a title
Yeah, I usually rock scratches with the vinyl
Peace from the Alkaholik wino
And I know, I know, I know, I know what you're thinkin'

[Verse 3: J-Ro]
This groove is so funky that is stinkin'
My Dress code is simply, Jeans and shit
I can't get in the clef cause my description don't fit
Those with clothes, left to see a fashion shows
So I sneak in the rear, hop on stage and bust souls
I'm J-Ro the Human hight
I like to rock the party 'til the twilight
Grab the girl, take her home
Hit the room and bump my shine lights on
Have no fear, I'm your Number one Bear
And you can't come here, cause who wants to play the rear?
I see too many niggas get a brain blow out
Now, I'm headed upstream like a rainbow Trout
I refused to catch the blues in the ghetto
Now, I get paid, to bring kids to life like Gepetto
It's The Liks, baby, and we ain't goin' to get whack
So Pooh'll buy a bud, hook us up with the thick sack
So you can bark if you want to
Boy, I'm comin' in the cut with my whole mothafuckin' crew
I'm the man, you knew I came to bust the dandy Rap
So I'm funkin' in front like the Handicap
E-Swift, 187Um, Kokane and Ro
With a finger and a "F" for Darryl Gates before we go

[Outro: Cold 187Um as a Night Club Security Keeper]
Yeah, that mothafuckin' song is over
But y'all can take your drunk ass go rappin' little mothafuckin ..
Aww no, no, no, you got to go home
Bitch, you got to get the hell out here
No, no, no, bit touchin' there.. over there boy
No, just get, just get your ass up out here
No, no, no, all barkin' not bitin'
You can't fish eatin, aww, uhh.. won't let have any..
You stupid old mothafucker..
Aww, just get your ass hole up out here
I don't have no comprehension shit, boy

(*Music fades as people evacuating off the Night Club*)[Intro]
1999
The world's at its end
Fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Cause it's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my 9 put it on my chest bust some cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm coming from the C-P-T
And you should know
Bitch ass niggas runnin' back
Can't fuck with Eazy
[w/ Kokane - several times]
Wet 'em up

[Verse 1]
This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words
Before your ass gets smoked, it ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nike's
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker
Slippin' takin' two to the chin
I'm on a role two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end anothers life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard
Now nigga tell me, do you have any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise, to get faded of the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught
Trippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
To many lives took
To many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from
The innocent little ones
But where I come from
We take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the 9 and I'm pullin', straight creep
Feel I need to take anothers life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low
So I'm not seen, case I gotta get away
Gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right took my time and I picked him
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squill when I stuck his ass
I had to grin cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' some what relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word

[Hook][Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the "Drop!"
Cause her son bust a slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rythym of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever thinks that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches, they look sucked up
And the niggas is killin', it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin', what I'm sayin's for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed
My appetite for destruction

" .. you guys know who I'm talkin' to .. "

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
The Appetite is tremendous - so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought cuz I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm de kamikaze
He took de swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went BANG [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, cause I'm hittin' like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets so therefor
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
Yo, and after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hittin' down the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war cuz that's what it's here for
I shoot down a milion niggas and shoot one more
And that's the milion and one
They couldn't hang with the appetite
Cause they was'nt rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up de asses appetite for destruction

[Interlude]
"Cops put a hurtin' on your ass, man, you know, they really degrade you. White folks don't believe that shit, they don't believe that cops degrade you
[Imitating white person] Oh come on, those people, those people are resisting arrest."

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Check it out y'all, in the house y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin' -
I possess to 10 commandments of the Hip Hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer :

Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your mothafuckin' neck

Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey

I got bitches all in my game that don't even know my name
Then pump your brakes, you hoes

You could talk all day behind my back, but won't say shit in my face
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch!
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, whooo
You are sexy, sexy, sexy, you are so sexy

Carla, Darla, Charlene and Camina
Tereka and Erika, they love to take care of a
Real motherfucker from the DPG
Keesha, Resha, Tammy and Renesha
I appreciate the way y'all skate
When the clock hit eight
Now April and Kate
Y'all be doin' too much
Running your mouths
Fuckin shit up, you gotta get up
Cus I done had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil and she told Karla
And she told April and now they all know
But I could give a fuck 'cus all y'all my hoes
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site
Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell 'em like this dog

(chorus)

[Snoop]
Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
Back in the days when I was on the block
At an early age man
I was on the cock
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get going
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog

(chorus)

[Snoop]
I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
She said she needed a companion
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
While she was at work workin'
I was jerkin' that skirt
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt
Bitch you a'int shit but dirt for dirt (biotch!)

(chorus x2)

(shoop)
This is a sexy bitch

{*Music fades out*}[Intro: Kokane]
That's right, yeah, uha
Yeah, I like R. Kelly, he cool
My name Kokane, and I'm a Pisces
And I love them ho's, and they love
You understand?

[Verse 1: KMG]
Eight booty bitches in the naked city
Fly bitches shakin' asses and hell of titties
Contemplatin' how the homies should penetrate
As we watch little Tina while she masturbates
She looks up and she pointss to my nigga E
Then she grabs the fifth of some Hennessey
She took it to the head put the bottle between her legs
Then she brings my homie Trigger to dig
Just another freaky tale in the Westcoast
Cause after 12 O'Clock we be poppin' the most
Niggas fiendin, to slap some ass, tap some ass
And they ain't givin' a fuck about their past
Now, we got naked ladies, layin' all over the room
Life lights with the nascent fume
Though the homies gettin' twisted of that major Kiah
Pimp Clinic got them ho's for hire

[Hook]
[Cold 187um] That's the world we have
[Kokane] That's the world we have
[Cold 187um] That's on every friend we have
[Kokane] That's on every friend we want y'all
[Cold 187um] That's the world we have
[Kokane] That's the world we love
[Cold 187um] That's on every friend we have
[Kokane] That's on everybody, that's on every friend we love y'all

[Verse 2: Triggaman]
Ugh, welcome to the thrilla in Manilla
Can you relate, with the armor cap peeler?
Chillin' the most, cause I claim the westcoast
And I love givin' a toast to the bookie
And freakin on some booty
See, the Clinic got a hell of a night
Donna Karan L.A. and the fume(?) is right
Bailin' with the quickness to the freak show
Pocket full of classics and I need more ho's

[Verse 3: Enuff]
To have more whores is what a nigga pleasure
I got more moves than any whore can measure
Yeah, I put take them to the cleaners
You still callin' my mom, askin' have you seen him
But she's happy cause I'm outta state
Trip incase, peep the next holiday
Now, I wanna play with mo' ends than I can explain
What I got game, I'm headin' to the first came
Speak some words and took them home with me
Freak them with the chronic, I get nasty

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
Now, I be bailin' down to show with my dick out
Ready to be this seed inside bitches' mouths
So don't you ever trip child, I come with so much stizyle
And all you bitches out there wanna know what I'm about
Cause I be hittin' back, sissies askin' have me a child
Have him grown, black, skinny, and tall
Got the conversation too, what you gonna hear, baby
How you got these niggas out here, straight livin' shady
There's one thing I know about these upon California squeezes
Yo, they be sneakin, they be freakin'
And they be down for the get down, when the gettin' be good
From Calabashies to Inglewood, you bitches know that I'm the man
Cause when I come through, I straight like jam
What y'all know about the techs flow though?
187 show, boo Yaa woow

[Hook]

[Bridge: Cold 187um]
You got to have that with the sickness
You got to get back on your feet
You got to use the mind
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
You got to have that with the sickness
You got to get back on your feet
About to lose my mind up in these streets

Out the muthafuckin' depths of New York, it's P
You couldn't get close enough to even touch the kid
If you did, you wouldn't get far enough to bag
I put my guns to work on your bitch ass
Hold up, niggas fuckin' up the game
Put my name in statements, cooperating with these and talkin'
Fuck it, I'll still buck em and gamble with my freedom
These niggas gonna learn to respect the P-Dub
I don't take no shit off of nobody
No nigga, no bitch, lets get rich and party
Let's not test my gangsta, that's how you get bodied
That's how hearts get took, pride get damaged
Lives is shedded, fuckin' wit these east side niggas
We teach y'all niggas 'bout this murder shit
We got Trey Deee, Goldie Loc, Hav and P
Kokane and my nigga Snoop D-O double G

[Verse 2: Tray Deee]
Big hitters, wig splitters, give niggas the blues
Fools loud mouth we all about spittin' them tools
From the coast of the locs were the Gs was born
And we raise up B.G.s to keep it goin'
In the alleys, not the valleys, killa Cali the zone
Long Beach bringin' heat takin' off when it's on
Killa daventry bringin heat takin off when its on
Fuck pretty, come gritty when we bring the noise
Big boys play for keeps when we bring the toys
Wet T-shirts, we search to put in work, cuz
Come back for ya homies as you gettin ya dirt dug
Congregating, operating Gs and hustlers
You other muthafuckers can't conceive our structure
The DPGC, the M-O-B-B strictly eastside and we ride on GP
Bandanas, hoodies, timbos and chucks
Stay mashing on busters not giving a fuck

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep
We connected
From the West to the East
Connected
Oh what you got beef?

We connected
Eastsidaz and Mobb Deep
Stay connected
For life

[Kokane] Yeah (repeat 30X)

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Connect with my dogs be that serious shit
Serious things when MOB and 'sidaz bang
Ice and chains, be best that you hide those thangs
And pressure to that ass we apply those thangs
Told you fucks before, when it rains it pours
Its a cold cold world nigga its Doggy Dogg
Better walk or crawl(for real), cause on the real homeboy
Fuck around and you'll be up in the morgue
Moms praising the lord, rev painting the picture
Of a wise young man who didn't get the picture
We keep it gangsta nigga don't get it twisted nigga
Cross me nigga, you'll wind up a missing nigga
QB and we truly rep for ours
Wars and scars, bitches in a gang of whips
When it came to this game though we changed the shit
And fuck who you with, it's what you up in the club but yo

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Uzis, AKs, Glock 40s and Tech 9s
Tryna take mines, you'll be a dead motherfucker
Come up short, with your life on support
Burning rubber down the street in a black super spoke
Fo' pokes to the neck, five sticks to the dome
Gun powder on my clothes when I smacked him in his nose
Real talk, show you how to walk the walk
All black all times when I scheme and stalk
It's something about being a cold blooded killer
I'm bananas my nigga, like a black ass gorilla
I'm G'd up, smoking all the motherfucking weed up
Drinking on a full cup nigga

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, defintely connected
How you love that?
Uh, like I said you can't spell the West with out the ES

Feel me?
Eastsidaz, duces and trayz the old fashioned way
Alchemist
Uh, yeah-yay[Nate Dogg]
Just yesterday I had to turn a bitch away
I got to many on my side - I got to many in my face
Come ride with me
Take you where the gangstas play
Often heard but seldom seen
Thats the way that its supposed to be
When you do see me
Mobbin wit a gangsta lean
Got a piece by my side
You can ride baby close your eyes girl

[Hook: Nate Dogg, Butch Cassidy, & Kokane]
I'm so cool
Cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool

[Butch Cassidy]
It's me I'm back again
It's never gonna end
I know y'all heard it all before
I just gotta give ya more
Catch me rollin in the night
If I turn off my lights
The eastsidaz in the game
You hear my voice and know my name
You should bang this down on your block
All through your hood
Burnin trees...burnin trees
Ladies let the music run right through you
Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy

[Hook]

[Tray-Dee]
I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up
Take this move, this groove and still G it up
Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke
Pimpin hoes down south, back east to west coast
Im Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze
Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez
Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride
As I exit I step with my stacey shine
I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool
Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool
Laid back or stay strapped for pay back
To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back
Now let me break it down a notch
Smooth like I do when I pound the cock
We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block
Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot
We so cool now

[Kokane & Goldie Loc]
If everybody turn there radios on at twelve o'clock
We'll make the world pop

[Goldie Loc]
It's too good right now
Blunkey blunkey
Remmey remmey
Plenty gumbo
Snoop gimme some mo'
Swakin that like a damn fool
Acedemics stacey adams feelin way to cool
Theres alot things that make me wanna frown though
But I'm grinnin like a motherfucka
Throwin dogg pound up
Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet
It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats
I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much
Talk shit to the homies cuz they know whats up
As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle
Still got patience still makin niggas
I just wanna be myself
What I receive from the homies is help
We had a conversation today about who ain't pitchin in
Keep suckas away that don't fit in
I'm so cool

[Hook]

*Kokane mumbling until the end*(Intro- Cold 187'um)
Yeah what's up Kokane
"what's up player"(cold chillin'in this muthafucka)
Yeah we're just go on laid back in the studio, man on this groove
And talk about some muthafuckas, that we don't give a fuck about
(definetly don't give a fuck about, you know what I'm saying)
On some fly fly funk shit, (you know what I'm saying)
Some shit that niggas bit, "what's up partner ha ha ha-
I'm talkin to you Dre, don't bite my shit
Don't bite the funk that feeds you
Cause I sure the hell don't need ya
Ha ha what's up..
Yeah.. now while we're in the studio kickin' it off
(you know what I'm saying)- on the ill tip
You know, I wanna do some old school
You know, I wanna just kick some shit off
And show them muthafuckas I mean buisness -(you know what I'm saying)
So ah when the clock strikes to six
I'mma put them hoes in the mix (hi hi hi hi)
And I'mma do it like this for them ( ya know what I'm sayin')

(Cold 187'um)

Ahh yeah ahh
1-87 chillin' in my coup dippin'
One thing I can't stand is when fools get the set trippin'
Now I was down with the gang truce
Until I found out you was gettin' ganked by Dr. Suess
Now you can get Compton, Long Beach
South Central, Watts, Carson even Pomona
You can even ran to Timbuktu
But I'mma creep through the fog bitch and I'mma smoke you
Now I'mma take you through you history book
Uh ah let's take a look
Yeah- when I first came to Ruthless I was livin' like hustler
But see you, you was livin' straight like a busta
I used to think you was a troop
'til I remembered you was in the muthafuckin' Wreckin Cru
And then I looked at an old album cover
It was you chillin' lookin' gay as a muthafucka
I could have took it any kind of way
But see six months later you were NWA
And now it's gangsta gangsta pimpsta pimpsta
But to me you was still wimpsta wimpsta
Yeah you dissed Eazy-E but I'm confused
Cause you're scared as fuck to diss Ice Cube
Yeah now you're all straight smilin'and trucin'
But remember "yo Dre, stick to producin'"
Now you say you ain't gettin' gangked no more
But I know who owns Death Row.. really doe
Yo I got a little piece of paper from someone
And not one line on it reads Andre Young
You try to diss my record deal, but I'm still quick
I'm on a mission, and I'm going for the fuckin' gift
So next time your in the place
I'm hollering 1-8-7 with my Glock in your fuckin' face
Cause real niggas don't go out that quick
So it's cool that you bit my shit- bitch
Cause I'm a baller by far and plus a G
And I like my chronic twist with some VSOP
See broke niggas can't buy it cause it costs ends
Shut the fuck up, you're just Dre's broke friend
Snoop Dogg you better get your paper work right
Because if not you'll be all bark with no bite
Yo- see we go kinda back see
But see things got fucked up when your flunkie tried to diss me
You need to go and check your puppy, G
Because who the fuck is he, to jump up and diss me
Cause I'm a nigga with a gang of funk
And I'mma show the muthafucka to keep my name out his mouth
Yo- I never got smoked you muthafucking new jack
You fuckin' around with me you gonna end up on your back
Yo try to diss me to get respect
But you sounded like a muthafuckin Redman reject
I give props when props are due
And my props to you is muthafucka fuck you
You're just a flunkie for the D-R-E
You punk muthafucka, you wannabe G
And you know I always drop the shit proper
You can ask your homies or you can ask the doctor
But he don't get no props neither
I'mma say it on wax and I can say it when I see ya (fool)
Try to kick it like you got stamina
Whoop that ass like Luke did in Atlanta
Oops did you slip, did you trip, did you run
Did he have a gun, did you want some
No I don't think so (ah well)
Here's a bone you can choke
Get your ass with the mafia loc
Yeah fool, so what you wanna throw up
Cause you're broke as a muthafucka
Lookin tore up
But I'm the original 1-87 no one can do it better
So I'm out, and peace to my homie Snoop
Yo I hope you get yours before they do you- yeah
And that's realer then a juice of a duce
See some might not like it but yo it's the truth

(SweetTalk (aka Kokane) )

Boop boop be doo- well alright y'all
Yes lordy, ah some say it's like the Peanuts Gang
I took your house off ya Snoopy- well a wrong
Say Dre, my name it's Sweet Talk
Now do you belive in funk after death?
Cause I do, so watch this

(Kokane)
It's like dip-dip-a-la we got to make a stack
We can fix your funk when the shits on the flat
Pump pump you up, send you on your way
And I don't belive in celebratin' Dre day
It's like "Hear ye, hear ye! Come one, come all!"
Kokane is servin suckas at the players ball
If you come up the deal
You will get blasted
A tisket, a tasket, we throw your body in the basket
It's a wonderful day in my muthafuckin neighborhood
A wonderful day in my goddamn neighborhood
Now rollin' tip-toe, incognito
Ichin' to serve a fool when my pump says so (Pump Pump)
Is another nigga with the D is plottin
And if you're fuckin with this nigga
You'll be spittin' out buck shots
So no pain no gain
Bakin soda free and they call me Kokane
Now I'mma fuck you up Kurupt
Cause I'mma bust trough your hood like the Schlitz Malt Liquor bull
Cause you gets no propers
Now your throwin' up the Pound
But I'm throwin' up the Black Mafia
Can't stop ya, what you wanna do?
Bring it on Snoop
And your whole fuckin' Puppy Pound crew
It's the nickel-slick nigga from Pomona
Not fake like lacers
But real like 'Tona's
Snoop Dogg you fuckin cold hopped it
Did most of the writing for Dre
And still you get your troops dropped
Now I see nigga's rich
But you was in the county washing master's shoes like a bitch
Now who's been sleepin' in my bed
Eatin' my funk, takin dope styles by the chunk
Cause I'mma funky to the finish
Cause your funk got a gang of B-12 in it

Outro (Kokane):

Yeah in case you didn't know
It's Black Mafia Life for life- fool
Above The muthafuckin' Law
UBU- what you wanna do
Black Hole of Watts
To my homies over there an shit
And to my funkinmuffin' Coconut
We clowns and ....yeah[Verse 1]

[Cold 187um]
We for breakin' backs in the '94, time to play a ho
Like we never did befo'
Since the prices went up for a piece a ass
See, I still get freebies cause I got gap
And when it comes to the question
"What have you done for me lately?"
Yo, G, I make them bitches hate me

[KM.G]
So grab ya coat, grab ya hat, cause it's like that
Ya try and play the role and ain't nothin' but a hood rat
So don't front, yeah, your name's Terri not Halle
But you sprung like a motherfucker when I hit that berry
And let a ho know what's poppin'
Cause it comes with the territory when you come a jockey

[Hook: Kokane] (x4)
Everything will be alright

[Verse 2]

[KM.G]
Yeah I'm in the mood I need a ho with much aptitude
To creep wicked, to come kick it
With the P-I-M-P, pimp clinic number 1
Ya say I ain't shit but ya sprung
But ya holds the number then folds the number
Then ya crawls to my house for a late night slumber

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, cause bitches in the 90s ain't shit
They claim that they a lady, steady
Suckin' every other niggas dick
So now you at my house on my couch screamin' out
My name, my status and my motherfuckin clout
"And ya nigga don't know whats going on."
Cause he always broke and he always gone
Now people might say that I am scandalous
But it ain't my fault if a bitch can't handle this

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]

[Kokane]
Now I just had lit a flya show
I bumped up so I gotta spit at the ho
Yeah, she bound to let me smoke but make no mistake
I got a 8 year bid next day for a rape
Owww, actin' like crows
And ya wonder why we call ya bitches and skeezas and hoes

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, she shoulda used the fuckin' mace
Tryin' to come up on the homie cause the county check was late
Uh, thats the problem with you bitches nowadays
Since you drop a couple a babies think you kickin' it and gettin' paid
I waitin' for Mr. Timesalt
So he can pull yo fuckin' creep up and pay my fuckin' bills off

[Hook x4]

[Verse 4]

[Cold 187um]
I only speak of what I've been through best
Believe I've been around from the pimp clinic
Hip, keep ya veins in ya fuckin' mouth
Bitches used to treat me like a bowl of onion soup
Now they gettin' tossed on the hood of my Lexus Coupé
I keep clownin' as you hoes cause you boos
I got the hat, the nose and the motherfuckin' funny shoes

[KM.G]
I clown on the witness, I kick this
Bookers in my business know that I'm attracted to the bomb
And ya know the thing is ones around that like to play
And hit you up with that ass with no delay
Shit, I learned hoes like takin' off they clothes
When them 100 Dollar bills is on the flo', really doe

[Hook x8][Intro]

[Eazy-E]
Aight, this shit is fly
I know Dre didn't do, the motherfucker, but you know what
This shit ain't right unless I'm rappin on this motherfucker

[Total K-Oss]
You got somethin for it nigga, what's up?

[Eazy-E]
You goddamn right, I got somethin for it
Matter fact I got the motherfucker right here in my pocket
Give me a motherfuckin beat

[Total K-oss]
Alright, let's do this shit

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Batter up, and let me hit you with some crazy-ass shit
Welcome to the E's bottomless pit
Where I play the muthafuckin executioner
Thinkin the devious things of a murderer
Yes, the menace of all menaces back in the Guinness
Book of Records for smokin motherfuckers, you see
Cause there's only one E-A-Z-Y-E
And I'm kickin the Chronic on this A-T-L LP
So one motherfuckin, two motherfuckin, three
All you punk bitches better respect me as a G
Cause I got the dope sack without a motherfuckin doubt
And when the shit hits the fan it's outta my mouth
Kickin that gangster shit, boy, it pays
And if you got the Buddah then motherfucker blaze
And hit it for the city of Compton
Shouts goes out to those who remain foes
Cause I like to be the motherfuckin underdog
And if we got beef (*bullets spraying sound*) leap like a frog
I used to be the quicker picker upper bitch
But I took recess and it's time to rip shop
By the way I gotta earn my dap
And it's always on if a nigga wanna scrap
And you don't stop

[Kokane]
Well alright

[Break: Cold 187um talking]
Yeah yeah, that was cool, E
Yo, we gotta let Kokane get in here and do somethin, man
Before he step off
You know what I'm sayin
Yeah, kick it

[Verse 2: Kokane]
Ah... dibby-dibby soundbwoy, dibby-dibby soundbwoy
Ready to catch you dibby-dibby-dibby sound
It's like heary, heary, come one, come all
Kokane is servin suckers at the players balls
If you come up the deal, you
Will get blasted
A tisket a tasket, we dump your body in a basket
Or bury you in a casket, dependin' on how you fit
We can go raggamuffin or get into some G shit
We'll take the gun or we kick the flavor
Cause when I flow, when I flow you'll catch the vapor
And now I'm rollin' on twisters hittin' them switches
I make a quick stop to collect from my many bitches
After bitches, they do my every deed
It's like some sell pussy, some sell coke, some sell weed
What you need, what you want I can supply
I got the new improved shit that's guaranteed to get you high
Yo, there's no same to my game, my name is Kokane
I'm pimpin' bitches in the church, preachin' God's work
But I'm the smartest thing to quit around
So put your money in a basket and pass the motherfucker down
Sayin' what King James wrote
And I'mma give you the Holy Ghost for a motherfuckin' c-note
Ride around town in a all-black Ferrari
I said, 'Hallelujah, oh the Lord gave it to me'
Knowin' that a nigga is motherfuckin wrong
I go the choir singin' that sad song

[Break: DJ Total K-Oss]
Yeah, that's why I'm a Nickel Slick Nigga

[KM.G]
Yeah, but it's time for ATL to get in this motherfucker

[DJ Total K-Oss]
Black Mafia, Pimp Clinic on a level
Also nigga, must remain Above The Law

[Verse 3]

[KM.G]
Nigga, Cali comes to Harlem, or maybe Brooklyn or the Bronx

[Cold 187um]
Or was it way out west where we be breakin' up jumbs for punks

[KM.G]
I paid 13.5 for some weight up in Queens
But you know, the nigga had to run it, if you know what I mean
Cause I'm Jack, the motherfuckin' Tripper
And if you slip while I'm trippin', I'mma have to pull a clip-per
And hit a corner, buy a bird in Miami
Come back on consignment for my homeboy Sammy
Now Sammy down in Tampa for himself comin' up
A few birds in the street, now his ego is pumped
I pull a heater on a nigga if the shit gets deep
That's on my homie, all my homies, may they rest in peace
Too all the G's and Mackaronies
From the City of Angels jackin' phonies
Elect me two weeks, smoke Buddha for breakfast
White folks in pintos and niggas get Lexus
Check this, the ho-tamin, macadamian
Much, much gamin, works and the fame and
Too much dicks for one ho, sometimes a nigga gotta sling it
So the rich bitches gangbangin'
The Mafia pimps is back funkin the section
Twistin' on them twisters with the hump connection
Ain't nothin' changed from the time I began
Except a nigga got a little more ends

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
Since I'm the last nigga, I'm the soul survivor
I got the illy illy style for the Jeeps and the Lowriders
I made a promise to myself that when you hear me
Kick the gangsta shit ?? though hear what makes a sucker fear me
As for the bitches, well I don't have time
Cause I'm a young black hustler comin' up on a rhyme
So skip to the lool, my baby, more bounce to the ounce
Cause I don't wanna be the one with a bitch that try to take my bank account
Oh what the hell, oh what the hell, they all think I'm a simp
But they all fall in love when they find out I'm a pimp
Cause temptation probably killed some of my homies
Livin' in a world of backstabbers and phonies
If I was Tony the Tiger I would say the world was 'great'
If I was Mike Tyson I would be in jail for rape
But I'm sorry this approached you cause I'm not the average Joe
That can flow, cause I believe that I'm worth much more
So I kick it like a homo nigga
They wanna be on mine cause I live much bigger
Why don't you say what you did when you said what you did to me?
Bitch, yeah, you all on my dick tryin' to gank me and my homies
But you know you never gets none
Because if gankin's bein' done I be the motherfuckin' one
From the East Coast, the West Coast
Now tell me who's the best coast?!
Who's the innovators and who's the perpetrators
Who comes first, yo, and who comes later
Cause I always got my bulletproof vest, y'all
Whether I'm chillin' in the east or the west, y'all
You know I have to give my props to the best, y'all
And there's the suckers out there ( ? ) to the rest, y'all
Yeah, cause I'm a nigga that's hailed from the west
And I'm smokin' motherfuckers like Elliot Ness
Yeah, and you don't stop[Intro: Roscoe]
Say to the whole world
I got the cocaine okay?
Yeah, I got the cocaine man
I got the yay, Y.A
Scoe Montana
Scodie Montana (Desoto)
I got the cocaine man (remember my name)

[Kokane]
Oh heavens to megatron, ooooooh
You have about three seconds to do this, ooooooh

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin' ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, bang this in your Chevy
We pushin' weight heavy, even if they won't let me

[Roscoe]
Scoe is chillin', makin' a million
Stackin' this loot 'til I touch top ceilin'
Miraculous, toothless, with top notch women
Acura roofless, blastin' my music
Adelle on my right, he done got me for my light
I'm a Star like Tri
Crazy youngster livin' a hard knock life like Jay the hustla
I'm a professional mic clutcher plus a dope rhymer
Ghetto poet with perfect timin', I'm an opportunist
Takin' advantage of my youth, fresh when I do it
The homie Kokane, tighter than choker chains
Soakin' the game up with dreams of Roscoe's name bein' a household name
We ballin', ghetto fabulous
Just tryin' to do my thang in this cold game, switchin' four lanes

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin' ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, bang this in your Chevy
We pushin' weight heavy, how much you wanna bet me?

[Roscoe]
Scoe is chillin', lyrical villian
Straight up outta Philly, West Coast feel me
I pack mack millies, dash with Daz Dilly
Dippin' through L.A. where it don't get chilly
I got a attic where I stash my scrilla
Keep a automatic nina heater by the attic
Homie my gat blast speratic blasts
Latitude accuracy, rappin' fast
(I'm) Young 'Scoe-dizzle, (I'm) keepin' it rizzle
(With) heaters that sizzle, me and young Bizzle
Hit the cypher up and stand in the middle
Puttin' MC's in the Rap Hospital
Hospitable, Roscizoe, my flizow not spitable
My dizoe not get-able
Everything digital, un-F-witable
We incredible and that's inevitable

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, y'all niggas ain't ready
Bang this in your Chevy, we pushin' weight heavy

[Roscoe]
D.P., D.P., D.P.G. - (X 4)

Scoe is gettin' in where I fit in
Spittin' bad rubbish, keep it thuggin', keep livin'
Keep givin' all I got, takin' what I want
Breakin' down the sacks and crackin' open a blunt
Crack the window to get some fresh oxygen
This little Porche we hot boxin' in
I'm a G to the game, low-key in the game
I got the key to the game, D.P.G. is the gang

[Chorus: Kokane]
I'm just a ballin' ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentiary, to makin' all this fetti
We gangsta rock steady, bang this in your Chevy
We pushin' weight heavy, how much you wanna bet me?

[Roscoe]
D.P., D.P., D.P.G. - (X 4)

[Kokane talking]
Oh, what you say?
Heavens to megatron
We still bangin' in space, the new generation
Ooooooh
Kokane!, Roscoe, Roscoe, Roscoe
Kokane, Kokane, no brainHOOK: Kokane and Nate Dogg
I was born... coming up from the ghetto
Where the OG's never let go
This is somethin I had to know
Had to be real sneaky
Watched niggas that tried to creep on me
Stay away from the ones that's sheisty
That's what my momma always told me
When ya livin on the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I never knew what my life would be, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I'll show what I'm talkin bout, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
When ya comin from the eastside, ghetto
In the ghetto, ghetto
I see you takin bills

[Kam]
I'm ready to ride, ready to roll
Ay check this mack I bet you're boyfriend ain't knowin
That I'm steadily blowin your back out
Watch me track out on these niggas and bounce out on these hoes
Get at em like "what's up trick" you know how it goes
It's Friday night, the club is about to close
And I was lookin fabulous
So I, got up to stretch 'bout to catch me one of these stragglers
True eastside dogs, and we barkin not simpin
Yo holmes 'bout that time to start this parking lot pimpin
I keep that thang, huh, posted in the same spot
Nothin but my khaki shorts, house shoes, boxers and my suede shine
I'm from the home of the riots
That's before the peace died but I'm still hollin out eastside

[Goldie Loc]
Uhh, what y'all busters gon do
When the pimps, bangers, and hustlers smash on you
It ain't about who's sellin the most caine
Put us all together nigga see you run thangs
If you can't hang, stay the fuck out the kitchen
Bitch I'm ghetto fabbed out, so fuck politickin
Waitin for a chance and the shit it never happened
Time is money, and when you get it keep it clackin
All you hear is, with my two inch twist
I keep the goodyear grip, so the dubs don't slip
If you want my claims, I think you besta make a change
So close your eyes when I let my back end hang
I ride til the motherfucking wheels fall off
Domie's got daytons, Goldie's got daytons

[Tray Deee]
All burnt to the turf up in a goddamn fool
Old school motherfucker breakin jaws and rules
Choose to bang, who's to blame but myself and the set
All my peers through the years steady gettin it whet
Give me a rep, that's what I wanted most in my life
Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop
Slangin rocks, sprayin shots, sayin fuck the cops
Locked up in the Chevy and my switches is hot
Gave em pain as I swang on the bitches I sopt
Bandanna on the antenna swangin and ridin
Eastsidin, ghetto life is invitin

[Snoop Dogg]
Me and my brother had to walk to school
I used to get him he downposed for joe cool
A couple of dickies, with some quarter sacks
Damn cuz I can't believe my kinfolk gave me that
Had a nigga lookin G'd up
With the scarf on my head, stealin sheets on my bed
I seen baloney sandwiches without no motherfuckin bread
I stole a pack of chips with the big homie Fred
Now we sippin on some kool aid
I got suspended from school for cussin out the teacher's aid
And now I'm bout to get a whoopin, but you know I'm steady woofin
On the side where they ride the most
Eastside is the beach, westside is the coast
And we ghetto like a motherfuckin hot buttered toast
In the mornin with some government cheese (government cheese)
We keep it ghetto like a nigga shootin dice on his knees
Get your money first rule number one, hello
Livin it up is livin life in the ghetto

Motherfucker - you will get popped (BLAOW)

Nigga we be fuckin quick, nigga we ain't talkin shit

Wherever we go, another player whore
From city to city, we still Gorilla pimpin'
We still pimpin'
We keep the whores the Ghetto Stars
We're sippin' Caviar
From city to city, we still Gorilla pimpin'
We still pimpin'

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
Sometimes I have a whole lot of bullshit on my mind
Sometimes I sit and write hype rhymes time after time
About these hoochies, about these hookers, about these hoodrats
Bitch you disrespect that, Bitch you get your head cracked
Now, pay your tribute to the P.C.G. (Pimp - Clinic - Gang)
Yo, and bow down cause we raw team
Cause I was out in Malibu with this bitch from Honolulu
You should've seen what she wants to do
She wants to do it from the Livin' Room to the Kitchen
I mean all up in the cabinets, breakin' dishes
Yo, now let me tell you somethin', this is how you break a ho:
Tell what she wanna hear, take where she wanna go
And when it gets real good to 'em
You gotta treat them like you don't even ahh care for 'em
Yo, yo, that's a tactic, you call it psychology
We are from the Pimp Clinic, we call it pimpology
And we pimped on like them Rolling Stone makin' hits
All up in the traffic, yellin' fuck a bitch
Yo, on that for reala my nigga
Yo, cause when I pimps, I pimps like a Gorilla, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KMG]
?? with the Antenna, hangin' with my Banana
Banana be in my clip, A.K. - set trip
Keep the Clinic mingle, peep the new single
Flossy pimp nigga, peep cap when I hit you with the mental
Caravan cause the ho's look good to me
They spit light too, I was hookin' up their weed
Now, they be streamin', and they got their mack on
Come on, yeah they speadin' love as I get my grind on the Microphone
Slide you in the homie's Benz, spend some of the homie's ends
Hell of conversation with you and a friend
I never lied to you, just so I can slide through you
Check it out, let me show you the view
And continue, to smell good and look good
And still be chasin' them hoodrats, like a nigga should be
With a hell of a Chronic Sack, with my fat ass Gat
Yeah, nigga's got a Low-Rider, plus, I mobs with my rockweiler
Chronic so the ho's follow
Worldwide, cause that's what I wanna do
Click with my ignint, Pimp Clinic crew

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Enuff]
I'm a type of nigga that cause a gang of drama
Posted, chillin', see I'm all up in your baby's mamma
Fools, get trippin' like they're royal
But see half of these bitches couldn't spell the word LOYAL
I run deep with a gang of killas
So if it's static, you better come for reala
I say trust no ho til the day you die
And don't be showin' these ho's your safe because it's suicide
I hit the A.C. as I roll through Killa
California, on the 10 on my way to Pomona
To make peace with my kinfolks, marinate off some hell of a smoke
I keep it real like I used to do on the street
Cause still water's run deep
And if you really wonder how I feel-a
Can't nobody get by a Gorilla

[Verse 4: Kokane]
Ugh, we run game on you ho's from start to finish
Now, it's the good, the bad and the pimpish
Now, why would I run down the hill and fuck one cow
When I can creep down the hill and fuck 'em all
Ugh, I know this freaky P-Y-T, so young, so sweet
She was only Seventeen
At one of my shows, kickin' it backstage
You know them young ass bitches never act the age
She whispered in ear: do you wanna fuck?
This young bitch made my dick hairs curl up on my nuts
My spidersense is tinglin', this bitch kept on minglin'
She gave the pussy and in my ride she wants to be a singer
Promises, promises, I tapped that ass and kicked the bitch up out my S-Class
And on my dash it say: Pimpin' Ain't Easy
I can't kick it around the bitch that got no rhyme with me, ugh

[Hook]
