[Intro]
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla "Roll up!"
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money, you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit!"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me, who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then Oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so, ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

[Hook]

[Outro]
G-Unit, are you ready? G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready? Nigga, ready or not, here I come[Produced by Sha Money XL]

[Verse 1]
I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
My watch saying hi shorty we can be friends
My whip saying quit playing bitch get in
My earring saying we can hit the mall together
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things, y'all niggas y'all know my style
Ma wrist bling bling, my shit bling blow
My pinky ring talk, it say "Fifty, I'm sick"
That's why these niggas is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man he gon' bump my shit
See I'm a liar, man, I really don't care
I tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear
You tryna play me, Imma blaze ya then
My cross cost more than the crib ya mamma raised ya in

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggas copy niggas like it's all good
Fuck around ,we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from NY whoady, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggas go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, roll out, I'm done
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, these shells will split ya up
I lay you down, the coroners will come and get ya up
See 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real bloody, man, the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bruh man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
CO screaming shut the fuck up in the pen

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty'll tell ya I'm 'bout my dick-game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work, man

[Hook][Hook: 50 Cent]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic
I got the magic stick

[50 Cent]
I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I skeet it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic, uh-huh uh-huh
I got the magic clit

[Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim not a whore
But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to sex don't test my skills
Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
.. and I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the "Drugs" baby, I'm makin ya HIGH!!

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lil' Kim]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I am the baddest chick)
(Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight)
(And I'll show you maaagic - what? What?)
Maaagic (uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I got the magic clit)

[Lil' Kim] + (50 Cent)
Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tasting it
(Sex ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (one minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
HAVE THAT ASS TRICKIN AFTER ONE BACK SHOT
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the CL drop

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Hook: Lil' Kim][Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Murderous mind state, can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down recognize
Westside, Deathrow, Outlaw Ridahz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons, labelled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dawgs
Commence to lettin' off rounds, then escape in a fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini fourteen murderin' niggas while they creepin', uh
Duck or you ass out, drink till you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga now they wanna really see
Bomb first my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies, I'm dumpin'

[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit
I'm stressin' but ain't no pressure here, I been there before
Fugitive, task force, at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' our my bedroom, I ain't there
40 Cals, extended clips, still, I ain't scared
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket to doing life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin', you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt, your guns clap
Mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put twin towers up, Pac, I'm knocking them back down
Poster child cheque, Air Force Ones with the crooked dial checks
I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder, is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the nine and the shell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box cuz them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the 'Pac keeping the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons
That's why I keep pressure on them like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
Songs are evolution, If I load your gun for you
And we bang it out at some other niggas you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever stupid
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless, you got the same bullets that you had
When I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac, the revolution

[Hook]

[Outro][Intro: 2Pac talking]
You motherfuckers kill me
Why yall niggas don't ever talk that shit when we be in the physical form?
Why yall niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiere's and shit?
Hahaha
Yall niggas get alot of heart when you get in the studio, huh?
Get that can the man motherfucker wanna talk shit on the mic
Well do this for me, would you?
Next time you get the notion to talk some shit about an Outlaw nigga
Or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas sayin somethin on a record, ha
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'

*Beat starts*

[2Pac]
Ah, from the pressure, yeah
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

[Hook: 2Pac]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
(Repeat 2x)

[Gravy]
Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot
I'm smokin on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy
Calicos, AK's, nigga's yellin' mayday
Payday, soon as the red dots connect
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

[Yaki Kadafi]
I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranahs or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure

[Hook: 2x]

[Hussein Fatal]
I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me "I can guarantee you a boss"
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect

[Hook: 2x]

[2Pac]
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlawz! We untouchable![2Pac]
Quit starin' at me like an infra red nigga
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Pictures of penny
Sippin' my glass full of henny
Hands on my semi-
Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap
It's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say
We murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out
My lyrics neva fail me
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal
'fficiently I delete then flee
The art of war
Livin' sucka free
Get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep

[Hook: 2Pac] (2x)
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Young Buck]
I'm starin' thru my rear view
Doin' 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal
So I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' thru my veins
And now they scare
They know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us
We ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free
But to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep

Come on niggas

[Hook] (2x)

[Chamillionaire]
They say that the moe they hate ya the moe that it motivate ya
My mind set on grind my mental set on the paper
62 hours and countin' and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the ruger
To live like Freddie Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax cause its like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on tv never a mat-tress

[Hook]

Don't go to sleep

[Hook]

Sleep banger

[Hook] (2x)This is 50

[Hook]
I, don't know what you take me for
I, really don't play that shit
I, ain't got to get you hit
I get out myself and spray that shit

[Verse 1]
I got a itchy-itchy trigger finger, nigga it's killin' me
Not to spray this shit
I got enough ammo shots blow I put a hole
In any motherfucker out this bitch
I unload to reload when you get hit I suppose
You gon' be strong enough to take this shit
I'm in the hood ridin' 'round with a chrome four pound
Can you see through the limousine tints?
I do dirt, the gat bust, I get to kickin' up dust
'fore the Jakes come around here kid
Niggas get knocked if D's start askin' question
My name end up in all types of shit
I'll be a gangsta nigga 'til I die fo' sho'
Whether I'm po' or I'm filthy rich
Now what you know about movin' that Peruvian flake
For that cake, I get rid of dem bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now I gotta have shoes, you know chrome 22's
Every time I get a brand new whip
I rode around in the 5 'til my money got right
Then I went back and got that six
I'm in a big white Benz on a hot sunny day
I call it the milk truck and shit
I'll have your ho eyeballin' at the light, damn pimpin'
You should take time to check that bitch
Find me ridin' through the hood actin' like it's all good
But I'm looking for a jux and shit
In the middle of the night, you can turn on the light
Find me and my niggas in yo' crib
Nigga holla if there's a problem and yo' niggas got drama
I got burners for sale and shit
Got them MAC's, got them 9's, got them techs full of dime
Hollow-tips and them extra clips

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
E'rything about me be gangsta
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
I won't hesitate to pop or shank ya
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
They can't hustle when I'm in this shit
Man I'm tired of tellin' niggas over and over
You don't listen, you gon' get yo' ass hit

[Outro]
Yeah, nigga cherish me
Like the water you drink
Like the air you breathe
You need me to live
Yeah[Hook: Stevie Wonder]
Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do'
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from

[Busta Rhymes]
My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin
Blendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it
In other words I

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
To visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin into shit
Like we innocent, actin older than we should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggas
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggas
Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
It's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit {*gunfire*}

[Outro: Stevie Wonder - singer slower with more ad libs]
I been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
Woooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh[Intro: 50 Cent]
G-Unit
No peace talks, no white flags
No mercy; I'm gettin' yo' ass

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Niggas done heard about my click how we stay wit the toastas
Blood in, blood out, la cosa nostra
You don't wanna bang wit the best
I'll have Doc removin fragments from your chest
They say God's a forgivin' man, I hope he forgive
Pray shells I let off don't curse my kid
They say Fifty done blew up, Fifty you changed
Nigga you stunt, I pull out
And you see I'm that same nigga that when he start to roar
I think he's flyin
Eight outta eight on movin targets
You run? You still dyin
Check my resume, I am oh so loco
Mama ain't raise no chump, I don't talk no pocco

[Hook - 50 Cent]
Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me
But I take it like a man, you beg for mercy
Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
There once was some niggas that tried to murk me
I hit em up, put em in plastic surgery
This 4-5 has made a lot of guys apologize
The truth come out, 'stead of hearin' a lot of lies
Some niggas catch a case and then claim they hard
A couple chest wounds will make a nigga change his heart
I just play my part, and while you shootin up cars
I'm smokin' niggas like a Cuban cigar
Let's get it poppin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef
We gonna be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth
I'm in and out the night clubs, ADD
Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks
These niggas tellin' out the blue
So you hang em off the bridge
At least they'll have to helicopter you
The Jimmy lifted the bags, the Bellhop will do
I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school
You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown
That's why them little niggas in the projects love me
You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues
I don't even freestyle for free
I gave em a break, flew over seas
But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the trees
Sit back and try to play your role
The doctors’ll put more staples in yo ass than a telephone pole


[Hook][Ja Rule]
Drummer drives me
In the bing doing flat three
Rather rip a nigga for rap than fight to be free
That's just me
Ja Rule inevitably
Living the lifestyle that get most niggas shot down
I'm in now
And only niggas thrown from tiers gon' touch ground
Seal his lips to silence the sound
I drop on niggas heavy
And all of my bing monsters is ridin' ready
Benchin the weight of Chevy's
Ox is like machetes, for when it's
Poppin'
Y'all niggas get to cuttin'
My niggas get to choppin'
Aight then
I'm a "killa" with the hyphen
Kill-A
Motherfucker before he kill me
Rule nigga, the Cae-sar
Spittin' razors
This killer Queens bing monster is

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Total vengeance
Prisoners doing life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
Locked in it's on again
Life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain

[Headrush Napoleon]
The white man's justice
Be the black mans grief
Animal instinct
Abnormal canine teeth
I earned my black heart for props to hold turf
Go down on a V.I. ox your whole earth
Make it pop at church service
While you're lying to God
We bring drama
Get it on with the entire riot squad
Ain't an enemy of mines
That'll step in my house
Cause the CO's is my hijos
And they settin me out
From Clinton to Coxsackie to Sing Sing daddy
We eat high hoes
Juice and jack mac patties
If not probably arroz con godbody
I got a one to three
Rockin with niggas biddin bodies
Never was a dead nigga till I reached them bars
And I earned the doorag gem stars and keloid scars
For y'all

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Total vengeance
Prisoners doing life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
Locked in it's on again
Life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Triple O survive or die
Canine rise with wolves
Sneak thieve your dorm, and walk on all fours
Locked in the mountains
Niggas'll lose things
Like they manhood
Hung with shoestrings
Faces disfigured
Disgrace these niggas
Run 'em out of the house like Replacement Killers
Cowards playing the towers
Loose powers
Won't last an hour
Get aped in the showers
Bing monsters come through and bust you
Guerillas extortion
Strong arm muscle
Drag queen kill a fiend for thorazine
Take they blood oath and form they own team
Niggas spittin out razors
Fiend for rangers
Locked with a sumo thug in small cages

[Tragedy Khadafi] (3x)

Total vengeance
Prisoners doing life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain
Locked in it's on again
Life sentence
To all my thugs up north barbed wire fences
When you come home dun we gon take a million
2-5 the most hated always the villain[Intro - Young Buck]

All my thugs and thugettes
Walk where I walk, see what I see
Now I welcome you to Cashville, Tennekee
All my life, I hustled all night
Now I'm alright, my wrist is all ice
And I did it all, without y'all advice
I done been to hell and back, twice
You can't do it like me

[Verse - Young Buck]
Now as the world turns, I let my blunt burn
Police writing down my tags, like I'm concerned
I graduated from the nickels and dimes
You need the fed's bitch to come get mine
Get on the grind ho and stay the fuck outta mine for
The kids find daddy laid out with his eyes closed
I know, can't be humble in the jungle
Gave a nigga an inch, he'll take a whole mile from ya
So I bust first, fuck this earth nigga what's worse? Waking up in the pen, or sleeping under the dirt
Boo yow is the sound of the 40 cal
AK's, banana clips hold a 100 rounds
Test me, rude boy don't want none
Got Jamaicans and Haitians buck, buck, buckin' they gun
Where the hood at? nigga, that's where I come from
Where shoot dice, snort white, sell crack and heroin

[Hook - Young Buck (50 Cent)]
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, nah you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, cuz you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)
G-Unit!

[Verse - Young Buck]
Somebody tell me what this world coming to
Why they go get they metal detectors when we come through
Ya I know we got beef, and niggas say they wanna kill us
But you can't get mad, cuz the whole word feel us
Do the math, half of these niggas lying in they rhymes
They don't even read the paper work, just sign on the line
I got a 9, and a heart to go get mine
And I'll be God damn, if I take a loss this time
I'm fishline, in the water, nibble only to get caught
May I take ya order? Ya, I can get it in New York
See the streets know, this nigga here'll let the heat go
Be low, don't be no muthafuckin' hero
A kilo'll get a nigga whole click killed
You ain't gotta spend shit, niggas'll hustle up a mil'
When you live with all the roaches, you kill all the rats
And the thugs that ain't focused, get they head cracked

[Hook - Young Buck (50 Cent)]
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, nah you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)

[Verse - Young Buck]
I know I got a dirty mouth, bitch I'm from the South
I'm nothing like what you done seen or you done heard about
I'm in my best on the block, a vest and a Glock, and the rest in my sock
Unless I was Pac, you won't see me with a cross on my back
Gotta do my own thang, can't copy that cat
Let me holla at ya for a minute man
If ya stand for nothing nigga, you'll fall for anything
I'm busting any brain, they say that I'm insane
But I came in this game with cocaine in my veins
What I'm saying, that I'm trained to go and turn a penny to a 20
You complain, I'd rather work with what he sent me, ain't it strange
How I went from a hooptie to a Bentley, I ain't changed
I'm in the hood, you want me? come and get me
Feel my pain, but don't feel sorry for me
Cuz there some kids in Somalia with nothing to eat

[Hook - Young Buck (50 Cent)]
You can walk like I do, and talk like me too
But nobody gon' rock with you
Cuz you can't do it like me, nah you can't do it like me
(Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear)

[Scratching - 50 Cent - hold on a second homie, let's get this clear][Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Murderous mind state, can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down recognize
Westside, Deathrow, Outlaw Ridahz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons, labelled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dawgs
Commence to lettin' off rounds, then escape in a fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini fourteen murderin' niggas while they creepin', uh
Duck or you ass out, drink till you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga now they wanna really see
Bomb first my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies, I'm dumpin'

[Hook: Carl Thomas]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation no revolution and no cause
One nation young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit
I'm stressin' but ain't no pressure here, I been there before
Fugitive, task force, at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' our my bedroom, I ain't there
40 Cals, extended clips, still, I ain't scared
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket to doing life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin', you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt, your guns clap
Mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put twin towers up, Pac, I'm knocking them back down
Poster child cheque, Air Force Ones with the crooked dial checks
I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder, is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the nine and the shell

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box cuz them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the 'Pac keeping the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons
That's why I keep pressure on them like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
Songs are evolution, If I load your gun for you
And we bang it out at some other niggas you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever stupid
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless, you got the same bullets that you had
When I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac, the revolution

[Hook]

[Outro][Verse 1: Reks]
Reks and Term, get your urn, get your hearses ready
Voorhees vs. Freddy boy we murder every beat
Giving heat, driven medleys
I’ve already severed heart beats and arteries
R to E King supreme philosophy
Follow me follow me pussy pardon me possibly
We knew AZ, Nas, Jay-Z, big bars
You spit charms then we split the walls and seas that part
Moses of flowers, focus them darts to heart stop
Till sasquatch feet, I repeat this is art
You are not psychosyllable, my lyrical’s top notch
Leap frog over y’all, hopscotch
We brought Sha Money for harmony, I’mma need y’all to promise me
Lots of accolades and praise for two rappers bringing it back
To back in the days minus the chains
The East need that king back so we came to be that boss
Reks and Term, it’s the Face Off

[Hook: Reks (Termanology)]
A deadly duo is a duo that can do it deadly
Psychosyllable, I’ll go lyrical apeshit
Face to face let’s face off (face off)

Psychosyllable, I’ll go lyrical apeshit
Face to face let’s face off (face off)

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Termanology, the definition of horrific sadistic animalistic
Explicit vicious lyricism, call me cannibalistic
I will eat any rapper that got beef, you looking like red meat
And I got dinosaur teeth, I repeat I’m a monster
Running through the allies of your conscious
Catch you at your calm son then stretch you like a Charleston
And chew the way I do chew rappers and then I spit em out
This ain’t nothing I kid about, leave jizzum on your bitch’s blouse
I’m on a mission now, bullets, pistols, missiles, bloaw
Pull up with my chick, she’s wild, she’ll stick you, kiss you, kill you, wow
I’m in my shrink’s office plotting on a Brinks truck
It’s full of long money, Sha Money made this beat awesome
You want a face off, me and Reks already ready
My machete is deadly, it cut through your Pelle Pelle
So let’s battle, but you bring it, better go hard
When you hear that show off show off know your dough’s gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Reks & Termanology]

[Termanology]
Trust me they do not want it, I’m fantastic
Hop out a mini-van blasted
I’m trash, I’ll cum in a fan’s eyelashes
It’s murder masters, duo double murder assassins
Killing everybody, making money off of your actions

[Reks]
Hurt on enemy cats can send my sympathy passed as ministers
Sinister sentences I send em to ?
Pardon the bitches I’m vicious, lyricism jurrasic
Pencil and pad shit past these modern rap bastards
Politicking with Term, how we gonna earn?
These rappers getting shredded, beheaded, pick a new cranium severed

[Termanology]
Call a medic, I said it I mean I meant it
Depending on how much lettuce I get I will leave you shredded
So forget it, call the ambulance
Leave you looking anonymous like mannequins
Me and my Hispanic clique be on some satanic shit

[Reks]
Shit me and my conglomerate Dominic pencil prominent
Poetry, ponder ? to spit all you can do is honour it

[Hook][Verse 1]
Even though mad niggas hate it
I remain the most anticipated
Those glad a nigga made it bast your Nickel-plateds
And salute the realness, cause mad niggas fake it
When I peel hit the floor
I conceal bricks so raw
I got the sickest Six-Four you ever seen
I saw and conquered
When it's on and poppin' my Dogs are barkin'
To eat food, my enemies feel heat like Purico
Some suggest they're equal
Lyrically I'm like a Desert Eagle
Mentally I measure Kilos
Physically I'm compared to Tito Trinidad, both hands are lethal
The crowned Prince
My underground shit you don't fuck around wit'
I move pies and fire loud shit
I'm in The Tunnel with the crowd nigga fuck V.I.P
Where Brooklyn go crazy when you bump B.I.G
And Queens feel it when you pump that Mobb Deep
That Jay-Z and Nas beef doesn't involve me
I'm sorry, legal hustle, Infamous affiliated
Last rapper to test me I humiliated
And for your information the jewels ain't rented from Jacob
When I move I leave a dent in the pavement
My name ring in jail and not for givin' no statement
That type of foulness consider it flagrant
O.T., give me a brick and see I'm gifted as Masons
I'm the realness, you spittin' that fake shit
Life's a bitch, I'mma take her on an expensive vacation
If it's on I'm the Reaper with the glistenin' bracelet
Sleepers awakened
Screamin' like they seen Satan
Word to Christ I need paper, keep the fake love
A fake thug couldn't sell a rock on the block I was raised on
Huh?!

[Hook]
Get out my way, gimmie mine or I'mma take whats yours
Make love war, spray up doors
Get out my way, you industry, we in the street
Wit' the heat pickin' weight up raw
Get out my way, stop screamin' what set you rep if you don't come around
The way no more
Get out my way, who want what, say no more
Matter fact take that chain off Dog

[Verse 2]
I gave niggas enough time - to front
I'm a beast on the street like crushed white
You can't be me, close your eyes, you can't see me
I'm the phantom in your concience
The shadow in the darkness
Savage when I write, I'm heartless
I'm iller than you, realer than you
Still with more Killers than you
It's mandatory, I'm self explanatory
Don't front on me, you didn't have cash before me
I'm the essence
You don't gotta like it, respect it
Like the ice on my necklace
And the fact I'm supplyin' connections
If you rhyme ill I'm the sickness that caused it, you thought you'd
Assume my position
I be hustlin', bubblin', gettin' money
Causin' blind rage with the Twenties
Y'all niggas is funny like Martin Lawrence
We out before the Narcs get on us
My life wasn't written, yours was, you livin' a lie
I'm dealin' wit' pies, all feelings aside
My enemies kneel when I rise
The realness in my eyes
From blood, sweat, and tears I cried
I got friends who died before they got to see me shine
How dare you compare your weak CD to mine
Or think you could see me with rhymes
Easily I'm, nicer than you and all your peoples combined

Chorus{*Antonio McLendon harmonizing*}

[Intro: Stat Quo]
YEA! Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh uh uh uh
Sing the song now, uh, YEA!
Ha, all my niggas in the muh'fuckin struggle
Uh, uh, let me talk to you

[Stat Quo]
We from the ghetto, born in the bullshit
Preacher in the pulpit, granny need a lil' fix
Blood pressure high, work a job, no benefit
Whip repo'd, now it's back to the dealership
Tryin to play the game, gettin played like instruments
On the fence in my defense, make a mile out an inch
Momma said the devil in my soul, I should repent
My dawg lost his daughter, say he ain't seen God since
Said "Look bruh, listen bruh, ya ain't makin sense"
He replied "You right," pockets full of lint
Willie Lynch hung shit, hint hint
The root of all evil, now I know what they meant
To my dawgs in Flint hustlin to pay they rent
Thomasville Heights all night in a trench
Fuckin with the junkies or 9-to-5 on a bench
Clockin in, clockin out, like "Where time went?"
Damn, YEA!

[Hook: Antonio McLendon]
I come up hard, hard baby
But what don't kill you makes you stronger
But I come too far, far baby
To watch tears drop from yo' hunger
As long as we keep on grindin, keep on tryin
Wishing's not enough
To change our situation, time is wastin
We got to come up

[Stat Quo]
Uhh, ghetto USA...
I keep tryin to get ahead, but the fact still remain
Every dime I make it take half of my change
Ain't nuttin change, same fight, same ring
But it ain't pay-per-view, it's a survival thing
Some slang green pills, crank and 'caine
Some bitches strip and gold-dig and whore to maintain
My aunt just lost her job, here this shit go again
Couldn't pay her bills, she put a bullet in her brain
Her chil'en in the same house livin with the stains
On the wall, can't afford to move, what a shame
Shit done drove my uncle insane
He talkin to himself thinkin he the one to blame
Got seduced by the boy, shootin trouble in his veins
Wanted the pleasure, became a slave to the pain
Livin in the streets, died drowned by the rain
His life down in twos{?}, his blood flowin through the drains
Damn, YEA!

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Stat Quo]
Now or never
Now, and forever
Yeah, every nigga in the struggle!
OH! YEA![Intro: Mortal Kombat Sample]
FATALITY

[Hook]
Niggas don't want no gun play
Cause I stay with the wretched
You fuck around and I clap it, I fuck around, let you have it
Niggas don't want no gun play
Yeah the twelve gauge shotty blast
Fuck around I leave ya hood full of body bags
Niggas don't want no gun play
When the shells come out the cartridge
Turn 'em all to targets
Niggas don't want no gun play
Yeah fuck it, lets get it started
Niggas don't want no, Niggas don't want no

(Whoooo Kiiiiid!)

[Verse 1]

You know my gun on me, cocked, locked, and loaded
And if a nigga want it, I will pot shot you homie
Threw away my forty, had to many bodies on it
Shotty wit buckshots spray your crew tryin to act hard
Get a nigga kidnapped, buried in my backyard
Guns in a dufflebag, Money out the bank drawyer
Bitches in my bubble bath, need I say more?
Capice? I ain't for gameplay
Fucking with these boys
These toys squeeze off
Fall back or ease off
Skully come down mean the ski mask on
When the fullest come out, it mean the beef back on
My lil niggas a damn eye witness, when its on, its on
Yeah we ain't giving no passes
The motto is if you flash your blasted
If shit get drastic, I'm burying you bastards
You know it's a rap when they throw the dirt on your casket nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If a nigga got a problem (we gon come for 'em)
Every nigga you see with me (got a gun on 'em)
And If you ain't got one (you better run for it)
Cause if not then ya dumb ass will be done for
Yeah its that go hard killer shit
Banana clip gorilla shit
With more bars than forty yards, harder than cement
Gun charge felon at large
Fresh out the precinct
Got a grudge with the judge so fuck what he think
Get money the bank truck and if a nigga move
I let the oozie eat 'em up
I let hundred round drum on the tool beat 'em up
Pushing the line, no easing up
Squeezing a nine, no freezing up
If I hit 'em up the coroner gone have to pick them up
Gang full of goons, you got to make haste stick 'em up
Tell 'em wave a white flag, fuck it we ain't giving up
My forty-four a nice mag
Nigga now what?

[Hook][Intro: Lloyd Banks] (Keri Hilson)

Uh! A one two, a one two
(Yeah) Uh! A one two, a one two
(Ooooohhh!!!) Uh!

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Excuse me miss, you must be some kind of a model
Enough to make a shopper run out of the column
Enough to make a weak nigga go mano y mano
Guess what you strong as rum out of the bottle
God bless you when he made me
I mean he blessed me when he made you I got a little game to
They know me everywhere I go that's what fame do
Where we can keep it on the low what's your name boo?
You stuck in your ways but I know how to change you
Arrange you tell you things like your my angel
There's no rules when it comes to this, write down your number miss
They call me Banks, my government is Chris
They feel me in the burbs, love me in the bricks
Four inch whips, on a buggy six
First class trips, and the bubbly's Cris
I work so hard to live like this

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
My past made me so weak but, you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down, now I'm right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me, shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin my cool, so I'm doin things I don't do

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, I got her, she hop in the ride so I could holla
My favorite girl outside of my Impala
I ain't 'gon say you a dream I don't gotta
You could walk around in the street with no collar
I pick up all the G that he speaks so don't bother
The innocent role ain't workin work harder
I ain't tryin to lock you down I'm no father
But maybe we can go further if you just listen
It's hard as hell for a man in my position
To pick a good girl out you gotta know the difference
I wonder if it's even in one in existence
Enough to keep my attention to go the distance
And I'm have to look hard to find a better one
Cause yo sex is a 187 'hon
You get a nigga doin shit I ain't never done
So now even when I'm on tour I let her come

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
My past made me so weak but, you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down, now I'm right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me, shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin my cool, so I'm doin things I don't do

[Bridge: Keri Hilson] (Lloyd Banks)
Your not the ones like I'm used to, I see us happy in our future
I'm givin you all I have, my heart, my soul, my laugh
Cause you are the only thing I need
(I could give ya everything and more give you the feelin you can't ignore)
Whoa oooh oh!!!

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
My past made me so weak but, you make me stronger
Cause everything was upside down, now I'm right back where I belong
Help I think Cupid got me, shock me all over my body
I think I'm losin my cool, so I'm doin things I don't do

[Intro]
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla "Roll up!"
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money, you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls
Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me, when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit!"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me, who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then Oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so, ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood

[Hook]

[Outro]
G-Unit, are you ready? G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready? Nigga, ready or not, here I come[Verse 1]
Around here, them boys - them don't play
You can hear the sound of gunspray e'ryday
I give two fucks 'bout what a bird say
Playboy Don do t'ings 'er way
I'm rap's LeBron, Teflon Don
Baguettes on arm, the next Sean, John
By any means I protect my charm
Blade'll bubble you up, like Moet, Chandon
I'm only calm, when I'm blowin' that chron'
Gettin' them flashbacks like baby hold on
I never thought I'd sweat so long
And re-enact the scene of my ghetto song
Eyes wanderin' off, breath all gone
Stomach all swoll up, neck all warm
Head still spinnin' off that Seagram and vodka
And you know who shot ya, bitch get the doctor!

[Hook]
(If you so gangsta)
Then why you tuck your chain in when you walk in the club
(And if you so gangsta)
Why you a grown man, still gettin' your pockets dug
(If you so gangsta)
Then how come every time you get into beef you tell
(And if you so gangsta)
Why niggas know you for that in the street so well

[Verse 2]
Now every now and then, a new kid gotta win
Yeah - but unfortunately for you, I'm him (I'm sorry!)
In my new tan trucks with the blue dot end
Hoppin' out that big truck with the new wide rim
While you cramped up, on your Jet Blue ride in
We air the G-4, let the crew dive in
Before Lloyd Banks tail pop on sale
I feed a nigga a shell like Taco Bell
I'm flyin' out to Japan to attract new fans
Let 'em get to know the man with the tattooed hands
Them gem stars'll leave your face all fat
So learn to stash yours in your baseball cap
I'm either gettin' money out of state or off rap
So I'm tryin' to figure out what made Ma$e fall back
And them niggas in New York know the man is a monster
And I ain't from Atlanta but I A-Town stomp ya muh'fucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's like everywhere I look and, everywhere I go
It's a bitch sayin' somethin' slick, but you can suck my dick
I'm grade A nigga, you don't know who you fuckin' with
They run up on your ass, you'll think you drunk your lip
Now I got money bags as big as a pumpkin get
And pistol as long as the hand Shaq dunkin' with
I ain't the type that's desperate
I'm modelin' diamonds now, you can call me Icin' Beckford (ow!)
My down bitch holds the metal, she got a Coke bottle figure
And a ass that's shaped like a bowl of Jell-o
You ain't even almost rich
They fuckin' yo' ass, like the models in my porno flicks
Therefore you can't afford no 6
So before you hop your ass on camera get your wardrobe fixed
Banks don't house, want no bitch, so if there's five of us
Then she probably gon' suck 4 more dicks

[Hook][Verse 1: Juvenile]
Uh, Uh, Uh I took my first break in seventy-five
I tell the story like yesterday when(??) was alive
Didn't do shit with my brothers without makin e'm mad
Couldn't get along with nobody so I just ran with my Dad
He took me right there where the killas be
Across court from Mileton between Clarion and Wilistry
We shot ball on crates tryna get paid by all means
Started snatchin purses by Wall Greens
Seen Titey get hit up in the melt when I was young
Paramedics couldn't even find his tongue
Thats when I started totin' my heat to call a G
My family was deep but wasn't goin in that water with me
Right after Mr.Martin's class Juve would leaveand me
Straight to Farret think I was worried bout the trulency? please
Got paid for them old timers puttin in work
Like Mr. Frank he sold fruit, watermelons, and herbs

[Chorus]
Even though the times was hard
I didn't fear no man but God
You lookin at New Orleans crime rate
Right up in the place, soulja's beware this is Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
This is Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
This is Juve the great

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
Mama thought her son was really doin it tight
When I was the one out here not doin it right
Until she found my stash she couldn't believe all the weed she found
Shit it must've been a half a pound
I was thirteen then back when Yoga was caddillac'n it
My campaign was let a lil nigga get a crack at it
Far from a gangsta but was learnin alot
Ain't just be the one that earnin the pot
After the turn of the clock I started bankin on the low with the dope
Got slugged up so hoes'll notice me mo'
Tee's, reeboks, and girbauds I had a few (??) to write
Regular hood shit the average niggas go through in life
Wanted to be a lil gorilla, and more day killas
(???) and we ball I know they'll flip ya
I stayed away from them cats who didn't communicate well
Cause them was them niggas that would've had me in jail

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
At fifteen I carried alot of wieght on my back
Me and my brother infact, I kept my money intact
I mad my real power moves soon as Juv' got one
Headed straight to the irish Channel nigga who got guns?
Shit my people Bobby and surviva got hit too
And I heard my name was poppin up in some shit too
Wasn't no cool cans off googlin no more
It was either cry like a bitch or go and settle the score
My first case wanted my respect in the worst way
Couldn't tell me shit when I was hungry and thirs-ty
Have a nigga way out his religion ya heard me
I guess it's punishment to who and never was worthy
Every since I leanred about guns and coke
I made a vow to myself that I would never go broke
Do what I gotta do to eat
I probably can't play no sports but I can work these streets

[Chorus][Hook: 50 Cent]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic
I got the magic stick

[50 Cent]
I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once, you gon' want some more
My tongue touch ya girl, ya toes bound to curl
This exclusive shit I don't share with the world
I have you up early in the mornin, moanin
Back shot, proper or low can't stop us
Been a fiend for this since Rakim made hits
Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I skeet it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin
Tonight's the night, you can fall in love
You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug
I pop a lot of shit cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you maaagic
(What? What?) Maaagic, uh-huh uh-huh
I got the magic clit

[Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim not a whore
But I sex a nigga so good, he gotta tell his boys
When it, come to sex don't test my skills
Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
.. and I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the "Drugs" baby, I'm makin ya HIGH!!

[Hook: 50 Cent & Lil' Kim]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I am the baddest chick)
(Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight)
(And I'll show you maaagic - what? What?)
Maaagic (uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I got the magic clit)

[Lil' Kim] + (50 Cent)
Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tasting it
(Sex ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (one minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
HAVE THAT ASS TRICKIN AFTER ONE BACK SHOT
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the CL drop

[Hook: 50 Cent]

[Hook: Lil' Kim][Intro 50 Cent]
Yeah, uhuh, let's take 'em there, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sonny did ten years in the fed joint, he half way out
He ain't home, his ass in a halfway house
Correctional facilities don't correct shit
Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit
A shoot out in 89' fucked up how he walk
He a grimey ass nigga, you should hear how he talk
Should shoot the shepard in the head and da sheep ill scatter
Let niggas talk cause action is all that matters
I asked about Barnes he sucked his teeth and said he was soft
Said the boys up in Otisville was breakin him off
Can you picture him in the yard, niggas yokin him up
Treatin him like a pin cushion, pokin him up
He came home actin like he hard as fuck
Must want a first class ticket to see god Uh huh
He stick his chest out tellin' niggas he don't back down
Wait until he find out Sonny’s back 'round

[HookX2]
Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up
Nigga front, that somethin gon go down
Nigga stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want
Without a strap, and you gon getcha ass layed down

[Verse 2]
My nigga Los comin home soon he up there in Fort Dix
It's on when he come home cause he can get 'nuff bricks
I was young he taught me not to run, I popped my gun par
You can ask Scarlata ??? and Amar
Them niggas used to hit banks back in the days
They embedded in my brain young crime does pay
New Cadillacs and Bonnevilles the very next day
I just look and learn, I ain't have much to say
Legs ill squeeze the life out you like a boa constrictor
Fuck a headlock, im talking bout extortion nigga
Apply pressure, its hot, get the fuck out the kitchen
When niggas pay you every Friday you ain't got to stick em
At the dice game if Ace roll a six it's no problem
But if he roll a ace he gon pull out and rob him
Losin, a little is alot, when niggas is starvin'
Man the drama in my hood is goin down regardless

[HookX2]

[Verse 3]
Everbody know Education shot Jamal over short paper
He on the run you want a nigga hit son he'll take it
Heard Wise got shot up over some punk shit
In the club beefin' with niggas over some dumb bitch
They say Willy was caked up off them credit card scams
Started a pyramid, the nigga took the money and ran
Heard he was outta town ridin round in the pound
Chrome spinnin' 545 I no lie ask how
Out on VA, Hampton homecoming he cruise by
He run in to the niggas that he beat, he gon die
E must’ve caught a jooks the D's flashin' his mugshot
You know it's his M.O. to run up in them crack spots
His sister, she aight, big hips, lil waist, big tits
Pretty face, we fucked on the staircase
Lisa that’s my bitch she freak off with a nigga, shit
Man I gotta call that bitch

[HookX2][Sway talking]
What's up world? This is Sway with a breaking news report
The artist known as Ras Kass, also notorious for his ongoing legal battles
With his record company and being incarcerated in Fulsom prison for 19 months
Was recently released. He just hit the streets and he re-entered the studio
But the big question surrounding him is
What the hell this motherfucker gonna do now?

[Ras Kass]
Hah, it's that SARS shit, hehe
Real niggas stand up! You know how it feel
When your back against the wall my nigga?
Shit, that's how I'm feelin' right now
We gonna let it ride out...

Niggas started it out, kickin' knowledge like Buns in Belly
Fuck that! Came out bombing first like Makaveli
I put the mac to your belly, then leave my contact in your blackberry
Niggas is sweet like black cherry, yeah homey it's hard on the yard
On these streets, I'm like The Thing, I'm just harder than y'all
More baller than y'all, my gate money win on brunch, I'mma teach you how to stunt
When I die, bury me bucked naked, face down in the grass
So I can fuck the world while y'all kiss my ass (smooch)
Get it while they hot, 16s is 50 Gs cold off the track
Nigga raised the bar, cock sucker paid to starve
You professional dickriders like my A&R
I'm a walking septic tank, homey I spray and solve
Hurl shots with a handgun, spray your car
Just accept your fate, it's a wrap, dynamite and electric tape
On some Pretty Toney shit, I'm from where the homeys dip on dubbers
Flag bandanas, and trip on colors
This my sickamore styles more sicker than yours
Get more liquor, stick more dick to your whores
You guys like bitches, lie like drugs
Taking $3 bills nigga and think y'all thugs, Ras Kass that millenium nigga
Watch fools in the scope so I can jemmy a nigga
Got to dodge with a hemmy just to semi a nigga
Punch y'all faggots, some bitches try to dead me a nigga
Sip remy with Kenny, six gimme a trigger
Stop calling me racist, I know plenty of wiggas
And the only real color is green
To the death, motherfucker, Re-Up is a team, motherfucker

Yall niggas don't know what's the business (yeah!)
My niggas fo sho with the business
Yall niggas don't know what's the business
My niggas gon' give y'all the business
Yall niggas don't know what's the business
My nigga, Re-Up is the business
Yall niggas don't know what's the business
What's the business? WE the business[Intro]

[50 Cent talkin] It's 50 Cent and S-N double O-P
You don't want no snoop and you don't want it with me

[Hook (50 Cent)]
Everytime I come around they like "Oh No"
I get to trippin; slap the clip up in my 44
Shit I been thru in my hood made my heart cold

No sense in coppin pleas when you see my knife out (knife out)
Motherfuckers light out (light out)

Here come snoop, uh (oh shit) (Oh No)
Sup nigga, sup now huh? (Oh No)

[Snoop Dogg]
Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol
Courdoroy khakis, stacies & brimmed up
Straight razors just keep you trimmed up
1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember
He's electrifyin & original
So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal
The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut
Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit
You betta check dat ho, that's what wreckin G
Now step your game down, cuz ain't no checkin me
You'll be respecting me until I leave this room
Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom
Now your name is on a tomb
They pourin out liquor with no room to consume, silly bafoon
I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin em
Walkin in my big blue chucks cuz I'm killin em

[Hook]

[Talkin] Hey what up cuz, it's 50 Cent;
What's happin nigga?

[50 Cent]
Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin (yea)
Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an
He who fears fate lives like coward
You go against me, you'll be devoured
Then you get to poppin you'll have change of heart
I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart
Have doc usin donors, dead niggas wit spare parts
You come back wit lungs of a snicth, and the heart of dead nark
Niggas never see the light till spark
Then they bleed, it get cold , then shit get dark
You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets
You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me
These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits
Push me a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin
Your services are no longer needed; rock-a-bye baby
My bitch will do it to you with a lil 380 (yea)

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm bailin thru the door again
Let momo pour again

Yea that's my reputation - you test my patience &
You & your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam

To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them
Off of them, Haha

[2Pac]
Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin, take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied, and today we stole them kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding it definitely, if they plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause bein here ain't livin
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you playa cardz right

[Hook: Keyon Bryce] (2Pac)
Playa cardz right baby (Haha, playa cardz right)
Playa cardz right girl (Take ya time)
Take your time baby (Be patient)
Just be patient baby (Don't rush)
Don't you rush it girl

[Ludacris]
Uh huh, Luda
You ain't gotta do that baby
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you playin your cards
You got a brother feelin mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin like a player, stop chasin the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin, no rushin, just takin it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, babygirl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue
Haha
Playa cardz right baby

[Hook]

[Keon Bryce]
You're the one, the only one heaven sent for me
Baby I'm hopin that you understand, that you still believe
That I got the special times, on my mind, just hopin that you see

I let my watch talk for me, my whip talk for me
My gat talk for me, blow, what up, homie?
My watch saying hi shorty we can be friends
My whip saying quit playing bitch get in
My earring saying we can hit the mall together
Shorty, it's only right that we ball together
I'm into bigger things, y'all niggas y'all know my style
Ma wrist bling bling, my shit bling blow
My pinky ring talk, it say "Fifty, I'm sick"
That's why these niggas is on my dick
Some hate me, some love my hits
Flex my man he gon' bump my shit
See I'm a liar, man, I really don't care
I tell them hoes whatever they wanna hear
You tryna play me, Imma blaze ya then
My cross cost more than the crib ya mamma raised ya in

[Hook]
I was a poor nigga, now I'm a rich nigga
Getting paper now you can't tell me shit, nigga
You can find me in the fo' dot six, nigga
In the backseat fondling ya bitch, nigga

[Verse 2]
New York niggas copy niggas like it's all good
Fuck around ,we crip-walking in the wrong hood
I'm fresh up out the slammer, I ain't no fucking bama
I'm from NY whoady, but I know country grammar
See me I get it crunk, niggas go head and front
I go up out the trunk, come back, roll out, I'm done
My money come in lumps, my pockets got the mumps
You see me sitting on dubs, that's why you mad chump
Don't make me hit ya up, these shells will split ya up
I lay you down, the coroners will come and get ya up
See 50 play for keeps and 50 stay with heat
I can't go commercial, they love me in the street
I'm real bloody, man, the hood love me, man
Don't make me show up in ya crib like bruh man
Locked up in a pen, I still do my thing
CO screaming shut the fuck up in the pen

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm in the Benz on Monday, the BM on Tuesday
Range on Wednesday, Thursday I'm in the hooptay
Porsche on Friday, I do things my way
Vipe or Vette, I tear up the highway
Shorty'll tell ya I'm 'bout my dick-game
But she don't know me, she only know my nickname
Left the hood and came back, damn shit changed
These young boys, they done got they own work, man

[Hook][Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah..
Payback..

[Hook: Prodigy] - repeat 2X
Infamous up in this, you know how we get down
Is that yo' ho? She feelin' our style
We come through the spot real heavy on the waist
So when they wanna move, we put 'em in they place

[Prodigy]
Yo, I was schooled by the hood, raised by the wolves
Trained by the pain, adopted by guerillas
Gotta tank for a car, ice for a arm
Got tattoos wit' skin and scars from brawls
Gotta buildin' for a crib, Manhattan for a backyard
Skyscraper ladies, they fuck me when they man gone
Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those
Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals
You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I get paid, cause I got murder 'fore sixteen
And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank
So much stash, I just laugh at yo' face
Blow a stack on David, cause I'mma pyro
Maniac from carriage, wit' the Rolls Gold
I was told by the O.G.'s like my Pops
If you can't whip they ass, then niggas get shot (shot, shot)

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Havoc]
Waist.. yo, I was raised by the block and new to the sound of the gun shots
Hustled by the bus stop, aged to the front stop
Block party departed, somebody got bodied
Right before I snatch this little number from my hottie
Yeah, young dude wit' jewels and barrel lens
Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix
Fast forward to '06, gettin' head in the '06
Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex
I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision
Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin'
From that hallway kissin', there was room in the Carlton
I can smell it in the air, P in that next room sparkin'
Me, I let that heady flow, meet me at the tele' ho
You don't do the tele', oh, fuck it bitch you gotta go
Workin' wit' a lot of dough, and a little bit of time
Bitch I wanna fuck, I don't wanna know what's on ya mind

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Prodigy]
Yeah, I know you can't believe it.. WHOO!
