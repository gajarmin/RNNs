[Verse 1: MIA]
I fly like paper get high like planes
If you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one down in a second of you wait
I fly like paper get high like planes if you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one down in a second of you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

[Hook:]
All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG)

All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG)
And a (reloading noise) and take you money
All I wanna do is (BANG BANG BANG BANG)

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
She fly like paper get high like planes
Tryna keep her from the US but she stronger than a gang
Cause she got a lot of fame messin' with the wrong name
I'm following the footsteps from the hood to the music game
My city on fire ain't no need to put it out
And I'm bout set it off its like I power in my mouth
And I'm bout to bring it out to the world
I want to touch the clouds, want to be your nature girl
I feel the rain and it's tellin' me to go far
I feel the pain and it's tellin' me the music hard
Should I stay, should I go I don't know I'm kind of lost
But I'm aiming for success I'm really sorry if you don't
Neva take drugs but I'm highed up
All the music from my MC in the hood growin' up
It gets hard when you're tryna blow it up
So stressful, you say fuck it, you be like "I'm givin' up"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Afrikan Boy]
I was at home, making my visas
Slippin' on my government, yeah you seen how we does man
I'm fresh from Lagos, fresh from Nigeria
If I look angry, it's cause someone stole my visa
If you walk into my kitchen you will see the white powder
I'll be by the cooker, whipping at you harder
Don't be alarmed I'm just cookin' pounded yam
Afrikan Boy, I never be a drug dealer
I wrap and sell pepe in the markets of Abuja
I'm a legend, something like Jay-Jay Okocha
My name is Olushola, I just got off my visa
I live everyday like it's the first of October
The greatest hustler on Earth I know is my mother
Like mother, like son, familiar like my father
Birds of the same flow share the same feather
I just want to make my dollar and my Niara

[Hook]

[Conclusion: M.I.A.]
M.I.A., third world democracy

So, uh, no funny business (you already are)
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go

Play in my field like a dandelion
Put it all on 'til you can't decide
What's it gon' be?
You, me, her, her, her, you, me
Girl, go beserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree
Go ahead, fall back, [?] boy gon' breathe
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Floating, sipping, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up, acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Hook: Asher Roth]

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo
Checking my fresh, everything brand new
Sexy old dude, saying "who's you?"
You do me, and I'mma do you
What what, what you talkin about Willis?
Man fall back, I'm just chillin'
Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch
Gotta have respect for my bad habits
P-p, now pass me the tree

Pull out the camera and shoot me a links
Cause I'mma act up, sweetie pie, what you think?
Go insane in the membrane, [?]

Mama told do the dishes but I'm here catching fishes

Girls on my mind, so I still mack up

Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fu--

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Yikes, I guess I'm actin' up

Young old school like Galaga
But I'mma call these shots, caliber
What it is JB, my Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies

Hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy
Chilling with Asher Roth
Girls let me touch, cause their ass is soft
Yes I'mma score with them basketballs
She gon' give it up, I don't pass at all
My crew neck match my two-step
I just had group sex on my new jet
So many pretty girl, I'm like "who's next?"
So drunk all my white friends like, "Do it!"
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Smoking, drinking, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Hook: Asher Roth]I got my eyes on the prize
And I'm ready to cash it in
Which dude wanna be my win
I'm lookin' for a naughty friend
They don't mind me partyin'
And he's so hot, Tamale'n
Show off no cardigan
And you can meet me in my bedroom, baby
As long as you know how to drive a girl crazy
You'll be Donald, I'll be Daisy
Gotta put in work can't be lazy!

All the little things just turn me on
Take me to the crib we can watch some porn
Or we can lay in the grass and sit and watch the sky, cause tonight real love was born
Late hours, candle light, that's the way you like it, right

No you can't
So what you do is small, I'm a do it real big

[Verse 1: Rye Rye]
That whole outift that you're wearing just dead
I showed you how to do it, like you was my kid
I was some big hair, and she went and got a wig
Where they do that at, bitches coppin' red wigs
I think of poor slits, the real Dr. Martens
Shawty said she got hers from the Walmart-in
She's sarcastic, I'm just smart and
What I said, did she take it to the heart man

[Hook: M.I.A. & Rye Rye]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me
And when I wear my tennis shoes
I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels

And when I get my hair done
I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done
Better than you

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Shawty got braids
So he swear that he the thug

Posted out, like a thug
But I don't do those, I can post too so what's up
He got on Jay's, I got the newer ones
You got dark blue, than I'm rockin' the bluer ones

And she go to public school, I got the tutor-er

Then I go and get my nails done
Better than you)

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
I got imitators, haters, and some psychos
But what I hate are bitches who are fame hoes
Seen her at the party postin' pho-photos

Girls been through round something looking more
And I bet you to do and do damn rock 'n roll
Facebook, face facts
Girl you know that
Bla bla bla bla bla
You should post that

[Hook: M.I.A. & (Rye Rye)]

[Hook][Verse 1: Rye Rye]
So, I was sitting outside one day
Waiting for the dude to come down my way
Praying, wishing, hoping, thinking
And I felt my emotions sinking
I've been waiting for the phone to ring
I check constantly, but it was all a dream
I never thought you could be so mean!
Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean
And why do boys have to be so shady?
First it's all good and he's glad you his lady
Baby this, baby that, see another chick and he act like that
But the thing with me, I can't take it
Kept it 100, was real, now face it!
You gonna eat your words and I'mma make you happen
So, we're ready for the action

[Hook: Robyn]
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
No you never were and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Yo, Yo, Yo
If you havin problems with the one you love so much
And you wanna feel his touch
Put your hand in the air, let them know that you truly care
You don't wanna do the fight fuss
Getting sick of the love pain
All the lies and the trust games
Guessing, age don't make a difference
And I'm getting fed up, so listen!
First you told me that you loved me dearly

I loved you, did I make that clearly?
And you're thinking that you can play my game
But I wanna think twice, so retain my claim
And I'm kinda mad at myself, cause I let you get the best of me
To confess to me, her

Oh boy, I'm through!
Tell that chick that she better get at you

[Hook: Rye Rye]
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
No you never were and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

[Verse 3: Rye Rye]
Question: what happened to forever?
Me and you always together!
Too bad I was too much clever, can't be played a fool
That's never
Suppose she made you happy or whatever
Learn from the past, proceed, get better
Good girl gone mad
Guess you didn't realize just what you had

[Hook: Robyn]
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
No you never were and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine[Hook: Asher Roth]

Where they do that at, bitches coppin' red wigs
I think of poor slits, the real Dr. Martens
Shawty said she got hers from the Walmart-in
She's sarcastic, I'm just smart and
What I said, did she take it to the heart man

[Hook: M.I.A. & Rye Rye]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me
And when I wear my tennis shoes
I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels
I wear 'em better
And when I get my hair done
I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done
Better than you

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Shawty got braids
So he swear that he the thug
I got that Amy Chu
So I look at him and mug
He standin' on the corner
Posted out, like a thug
But I don't do those, I can post too so what's up
He got on Jay's, I got the newer ones
You got dark blue, than I'm rockin' the bluer ones
She got on the dress, I got on the cuter ones
And she go to public school, I got the tutor-er

[Hook: M.I.A. & (Rye Rye)]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me
(And when I wear my tennis shoes
I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels
I wear 'em better
And when I get my hair done
I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done
Better than you)

[Verse 3: M.I.A.]
I got imitators, haters, and some psychos
But what I hate are bitches who are fame hoes
Seen her at the party postin' pho-photos
She didn't think about the wall part painting clothes
Girls been through round something looking more
And I bet you to do and do damn rock 'n roll
Facebook, face facts
Girl you know that
Bla bla bla bla bla
You should post that

[Hook: M.I.A. & (Rye Rye)]
So you're in the magazines wearing my shit
Heard you singing songs that sounds like me
(And when I wear my tennis shoes
I wear 'em way better
And when I wear my heels
I wear 'em better
And when I get my hair done
I get it way better
Then I go and get my nails done)
Better than you

If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one down in a second of you wait
I fly like paper get high like planes if you catch me on the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here I'll make 'em all day
I'll get one down in a second of you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every step I get, I'm clockin' that game
Everyone's a winner, we make 'em off fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
She fly like paper get high like planes
Tryna keep her from the US but she stronger than a gang
Cause she got a lot of fame messin' with the wrong name
I'm following the footsteps from the hood to the music game
My city on fire ain't no need to put it out
And I'm bout set it off its like I power in my mouth
And I'm bout to bring it out to the world
I want to touch the clouds, want to be your nature girl
I feel the rain and it's tellin' me to go far
I feel the pain and it's tellin' me the music hard
Should I stay, should I go I don't know I'm kind of lost
But I'm aiming for success I'm really sorry if you don't
Neva take drugs but I'm highed up
All the music from my MC in the hood growin' up
It gets hard when you're tryna blow it up
So stressful, you say fuck it, you be like "I'm givin' up"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Afrikan Boy]
I was at home, making my visas
Slippin' on my government, yeah you seen how we does man
I'm fresh from Lagos, fresh from Nigeria
If I look angry, it's cause someone stole my visa
If you walk into my kitchen you will see the white powder
I'll be by the cooker, whipping at you harder
Don't be alarmed I'm just cookin' pounded yam
Afrikan Boy, I never be a drug dealer
I wrap and sell pepe in the markets of Abuja
I'm a legend, something like Jay-Jay Okocha
My name is Olushola, I just got off my visa
I live everyday like it's the first of October
The greatest hustler on Earth I know is my mother
Like mother, like son, familiar like my father
Birds of the same flow share the same feather
I just want to make my dollar and my Niara

[Hook]

[Conclusion: M.I.A.]
M.I.A., third world democracy

Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go

[End]Jello! Jello! Jello!

[Verse 1: Far East Movement]
Hola, Yo ma, I'm on the east side coolin' with my chola

Hit her with the stick, now she call me donatello

[Hook][Verse 1: Rye Rye]
So, I was sitting outside one day
Waiting for the dude to come down my way
Praying, wishing, hoping, thinking
And I felt my emotions sinking
I've been waiting for the phone to ring
I check constantly, but it was all a dream
I never thought you could be so mean!
Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean
And why do boys have to be so shady?
First it's all good and he's glad you his lady
Baby this, baby that, see another chick and he act like that
But the thing with me, I can't take it
Kept it 100, was real, now face it!
You gonna eat your words and I'mma make you happen
So, we're ready for the action

[Hook: Robyn]
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
No you never were and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
Yo, Yo, Yo
If you havin problems with the one you love so much
And you wanna feel his touch
Put your hand in the air, let them know that you truly care
You don't wanna do the fight fuss
Getting sick of the love pain
All the lies and the trust games
Guessing, age don't make a difference
And I'm getting fed up, so listen!
First you told me that you loved me dearly

I loved you, did I make that clearly?
And you're thinking that you can play my game
But I wanna think twice, so retain my claim
And I'm kinda mad at myself, cause I let you get the best of me
To confess to me, her

Oh boy, I'm through!
Tell that chick that she better get at you

[Hook: Rye Rye]
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
No you never were and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

[Verse 3: Rye Rye]
Question: what happened to forever?
Me and you always together!
Too bad I was too much clever, can't be played a fool
That's never
Suppose she made you happy or whatever
Learn from the past, proceed, get better
Good girl gone mad
Guess you didn't realize just what you had

[Hook: Robyn]
Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
No you never were and you never will be mine
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
