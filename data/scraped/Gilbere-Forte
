[Intro: Kanye West & Stromae]
Throw your hands in the sky right now
(Alors on danse)
Throw your hands in the sky right now
It's going down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Unfortunately for the rest of ya’ll
I’m way better than the best of all
And even though they focus on just the flaws
They still gonna annihilate the festivals
And we still gonna sip Dom Perignon
And still gonna eat the filet mignon
Yeah, yeah, yeah I’ve been known to cover up my eyes
With the Ray Beons

[Refrain: Stromae & Kanye West]
Alors on danse (x3)
Alors on, throw your hands in the sky right now
Alors on

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Flashing lights, the stress of life
Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like there’s no tomorrow
Wake up in Paris with a Russian model
Throw your hands in the sky
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
I call this club Titanic
Why, cause it’s going down

[Refrain: Stromae & Kanye West]
Alors on danse (x4)
Alors on chante
Lalalalalala, lalalalalala
Alors on chante
Lalalalalala, lalalalalala
Alors on chante
Throw your hands in the sky right now
Alors on chante
Throw your hands in the sky right now
Et puis seulement quand c'est fini
Alors on danse (x5)

[Verse 4: Gilbere Forte]
Roll call in the club
Life’s a bitch feel her up
She be in my mind like a microchip
I’m ready to blow like nitroglis
Gone gone like a light so trick
I am on some psycho shit
Dance floor every night my bliss
Fed up with the rub don't bite your lip
Bon T.R.S. and pure gold
Max this out in euros
Bartender fill it up till I can’t remember
Feeling hot summer nights in the winterr
I’mma better my life till we all sit up
Since we are here we are live
Ye and I make you touch the sky[Hook]
Look at my life, this is what I do
You was taking flights but you ain’t ever flew
I put it all on the line, I’m standing on the money
Life is my bitch, you will never take her from me
Look at my life, this is what I do
You was taking flights but you ain’t ever flew
I put it all on the line, I’m standing on the money
Life is my bitch, you will never take her from me

[Gilbere Forte]
Stuck in a room, eyes real low, staring at the engineer ‘cause time froze
Blurry vision, I’m only seeing what God chose
So I let my heart breathe and I sigh slow
At any minute, I could lose my vibe
A couple of single bitches drunk from the high
A couple lies, couple flows and them hard bars
A screw face is all of you damn Pop-Tarts
I just wanna make this music, fuck you and your pop charts
I’m a blessing to this art, the message I retort
Nothing is impossible but imposters can measure you
Tell it you’ll never make it, death is only awaiting
The dreams of a man, life full of richness, wealth in the soul
Believe it or get rid of it, I’m only trying to find out where I’m headed
And if Heaven never calls, I’m still rocking God on my letterman

[Hook][Intro]
Yeah
My daddy was born ready, I was ready

[Verse 1]
Your time of death, my cost of living
Michigan/Philly nigga, red, white Jordan 6's
Went to school in the 'burbs, but that make no difference
White boys on my team go harder then niggas
We the best in the game, but yo coach ain't never listen
Unsigned like a motherfucka, now that the labels fishing
Signed a deal a year ago, got out of it cuz I ain't feel the dough
Got a cool mil off "Black Chukkas", I know yo but I'm cool bro

All black, all black, all black! (My nigga)
But you anointed Christian
Yo mama dressed you for church nigga, who you kiddin?
Dick-in-the-booty ass niggas, you must be shittin'
They say I'm the greatest in the world, but I'm tryna live it
40 ounce got all the bitches, P.G county got all the bitches
I’m a trill nigga, in Hilfiger, my style leave you end up missing
Fashion killer...Paris life I'm with Bob Sinclar...(get it?)
3000 electrolytes
Walk hard and my soul glow, 3000 electro lights
Got coke lines in the bathroom, baddest bitches live the wild life
Tall bitches give the best head, standing up on my bed
I drive a go cart through the shopping mall
Staring up skirts: no draws
Cruising in front of your bitch, parking her whip
Talking and gawking the kid, arguing 'bout shit
Both of y’all need to get off of my dick, dick
A nigga came too far, to live a lie
I die young...to be still alive

[Hook]
Let us pray, let us pray, let us pray
Let us pray, let us pray, let us pray

[Verse 2]
Who will survive in America, on the top floor of hysteria
Looking down to my life, like how the fuck did I marry her?
Life’s a bitch but she suck a good dick
Ass fatter than the bottom of a Benz, sitting on low 23 inch
Shoosh!, belly of the beast, I ain’t hungry though
Vegan life for you pork rolls, En Noir leather short flow
Android Homme when I walk (cold), Balmain sweater when I’m laying low
I'm on a balcony blowing halo's
With Topo Chico by the case load, staring at life tryna drink slow
One day I'mma ball like, Jay-Dub and Susu
On a private jet to that red moon, Instagram on my phone too
On a plane wildin out making babies
Goddamn I must be crazy (nigga)
Fucking like I'm in the 80s (nigga), 87 I was that baby (wooo)
Bombs bombs blown away
My swag done fucked yo hoes away
I style myself put your clothes away
Raak killed the beat, thats a throw away
Can't find the body muthafuckin cold case, fuck everybody
Young OG…middle finger to niggas dick riding me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wear my heart on my chest, ffffuck yo necklace, fuck yo necklace
Turning my phone off, ffffuck yo texts, fuck yo texts
My daddy dead, I was born a blessing, born a blessing
Summer time in '92, back seat, I was rolling Benzes (Swerve!)
Clio Road, to that Southside, I’m coming home, at Grammy time
So my grandma know I still ride, for my blood, I will die
Forte and Bryant, I'm so king nigga kiss my highness
En Noir life, you niggas get from round us (wooo)
Nigga! You think this the death of a dynasty
This art of war, Raak and DeNiro beside of me, I’ve been quiet too long
JWhi nigga pass that loud, smoking on that heaven
Can you see them clouds?

[Let us pray][Hook: Active Child]
Everything reminds me of you
I think I’m losing my mind
Staring at your face in the rearview
And I can get all of the time
Nolita, Nolita
Nolita
Nolita, Nolita

[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]
Yea, lookin back on a life that I thought that I could never have
Spent time with a woman I thought that I could never match
Broke all my ties to the chick that caught them feelings fast
I fall in love to that mother skunker, jumped all on my back
That’s when I meet you, the girl with the dragon tattoo
Black eyes, cold hips in a black coupe
With that fast zoom and that Vera Wang
In them Christian Lou's
With a voice full of heaven I stand to lose
With a heart to say I don’t steal shit
I'm a real bitch
Independent, no dick goin' make me kill this
So pressed up on her
Ride right at the moment, she said if you want it
You better holy matrimony, woah
I’m cool, rolling with them punches
But I’m only down for your loving
Back rub when we cuddling
My thug passion, you be lovin it
Get lost in the town, we make the time
That’s when it all happen, champagne glasses
Drunk off passion
With a little bit of lust and a little bit of you
And a little bit of face sucking off this mood
You keep your head down with no panties on
Adina Howard with no cameras on
Your light’s low but your body's on
You tie me to the bed post
Fuckin me off the edge though
Bathtub, hot salt water
Rose pedals with that blunted sour
Talkin' dirty in the darkest hour
With all of my best
I put your engagement ring on the desk
Everything was set
But then you left

[Hook: Active Child]

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
I was left in the dark
I was left in the cold
I was left getting old
With no idea why you kept a secret so long
It’s been three years since I’ve seen you
And my heartbeat still needs you
I can’t find a number to reach you
And your whereabouts to meet you
So I gave up, hit the road
Concert after concert
And city after city, getting drunk with some stupid hoes
Ridin through the city with the big lights
Downtown, tryna feel life
In a glora kadan with a glass of Henny
And a bad chick to my right
Smellin like my past
What the fuck’s in my drink
When I realized what I’m next to
Matching dragon tattoos
It was you, it was you all along
And you was fuckin' yo ex girl
A body of lies and I’m blessed girl
And I hate loving yo sex girl
I was yo experiment but I died, you kicked dirt on my grave
And for what? To get a taste for dick you fuckin bitch

[Bridge: Active Child]
Everything reminds me of you
I think I’m losing my mind
Staring at your face in the rearview
And I can get

[Hook: Active Child]

[Outro: Active Child and Gilbere Forte]
Nolita, Nolita
Nolita
Fucked up
You know, I ain’t even really
See it comin from somebody like that
You know I never liked love
I fuckin hate meChorus:
I step up in this mother fucker all black chukkas
All, all black girl what, what’s really good
All black skully, y’all can’t tell me, nothin
No I said y’all can’t tell me

(repeat)

I, I step up in this motherfucker all black chukkas
Simple low all black form of comfort
Walk a million miles in a lifetime cuttin'
Surprisin by my rise and got me glidin up ya mind
We flyin through the sky just to feel high
Different time zones anywhere Ima be like
Supreme means of a dream the team riders is clean really rippin the scene
Out to get cream
You know what I mean, you know you know what I mean
Out to get cream
Outta , outta get cream
The American dream we are on a big screen
So open your eyes and welcome to the live

(Chorus x2)

I’m fresh to def with a million scuffs
Through worn my white tee with my APC jeans
Black frames on complimentin the steez
Feelin so blessed God pressed my lean
Confidence through the roof couldn’t see it with a telescope
How you still talkin when all I hear is yellin for
Creatin the hype creates my height
Can’t Ichat so high I Skype
The leather on my taupe box means I’m right, right
You will never crease my life
Always ahead of my time never missin a flight
My chukkas all black but the whips all white

(Chorus x2)

Aye, aye
The label of our life keep us fly by night
Don’t accept checks if the commas ain’t right
The rubber on our sole worth more than its price
The way we break it down give us 25 to life
Uh, Straight off the wall, chin high 5.0 grind wishin I’d fall
Pause
You know how we are, fresh out the box, shoes never laced
Walkin in the way, walkin, walkin in the place
I look in your face and tell that you a sucka
You never understand how we get it in our chukkas, motherfuckers

(Chorus x2)[Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
I’m usually on some first name basis
But niggas fuck my name up so much, I wanna change it
A wise man told me to live what my mama gave me
A chance to see life outside of a lady
I’m 24 now, no rain in my clouds so my sky stay true
Purer than ice blue, when you closer to your dreams
People that surround you start hating on your team
They wanna wear a crown too
You try to chase a life that don’t wanna find you
It’s hard to gain credit for something that’s not you
The price people paying to make it as a fan
Keep you closer to the game but you lost in the stands
I ain’t no missionary but your girl love dictionary
It’s clear that I’m able to tell it all
The truth is a weapon, I’m the quickest on the draw
Race a life and playing chicken, I ain’t getting out the car bitch

[Hook]
You riding so cold, treble real low, bass keep thumping, we nodding
Niggas turned up, smoke in the air, Kush rolled up, we mobbing
You riding so cold, treble real low, bass keep thumping, we nodding
Niggas turned up, smoke in the air, Kush rolled up, we mobbing

[Verse Two: Droop-E]
Me, I’m a pro, they? Proteges, I’m from the Bay
I got more game than Milton Bradley
Sadly, I tell you a lot of these fools fakers
No soul like some Chuck Taylors, high in the sky
Smoking cherry pie on a flight, red eye
Land at 11:45, I tell her relax, recline, kick back like recoil
Now she spoiled, it’s a wrap like foil
Shout out to rapping forte, Gilbere and E-40
The sick with it lieutenant about to bring it back like Rogaine
The niggas square like cubicles, girl, you beautiful
From your hair to your cuticles, uh, I was built for this
I was born in this shit, I was made for this uh
I don’t think y’all understand, since H3, already been a made man

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Casey Veggies]
Homie, my generation fucked over, I give out luck to four leaf clovers
At least I can save up, cop a Range Rover, got a chick in the back
And she a grade over, a little older ‘cause I’m fresher than a Folgers
My girls all in the front row, they all having good times
Wrote it down, took ten minutes to spit all good rhymes
Just trying to shine my nigga, I’m three years strong on that grind my nigga
One hand to the sky for those no longer with us
All daps and handshakes, if you paying, you’ll get us
Girl, if you come to the hotel, you laying with winners
And Inglewood killing but I stay away from splinters
And niggas hating on it ‘cause they can’t ball with us
Girl, you know that you come here and take your pictures
I’m a star, I would too if I was you especially that I know what I’m gon’ do, Veggies

[Hook 2X][Hook: Freelance Whales]

We get up early just to start cranking the generator
Our limbs have been asleep we need to get the blood back in 'em
We're finding every day several ways that we could be friends

[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]

I wake up in the morning and I ask myself:
"Is life worth living, do I ask for help?"
Headed to the studio to speak what I meant to
2,000 hours of shit you ain't been through
I can be your voice so the world can hear you
Bring you closer to your dream if your dreams ain't near you
Open up your eyes when you look in the sky
Let my music be your wings when you're ready to fly

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]

The days, the nights, two halves of my life
Two half of whats right, the rights of my fight
We are the generators of the flashing lights
So we can pull the plug whenever we like
Goals, means for self esteem
To wash away our flaws, we don't need no cream
This is who I am, what god made me to be
Gilbere Forte and 87 dreams

[Hook: Freelance Whales]

We keep on churning and the lights inside the house turned on
And in our native language we are chanting ancient songs
And when we quiet down the house chants on without us

We get up early just to start cranking the generator
Our limbs have been asleep we need to get the blood back in 'em
We're finding every day several ways that we could be friends[Hook: Freelance Whales]

Flashing lights, the stress of life
Its way too much to handle in one night
Live this life like there’s no tomorrow
Wake up in Paris with a Russian model
Throw your hands in the sky
If anybody got five dollars in your pocket right now
I call this club Titanic
Why, cause it’s going down

Roll call in the club
Life’s a bitch feel her up
She be in my mind like a microchip
I’m ready to blow like nitroglis
Gone gone like a light so trick
I am on some psycho shit
Dance floor every night my bliss
Fed up with the rub don't bite your lip
Bon T.R.S. and pure gold
Max this out in euros
Bartender fill it up till I can’t remember
Feeling hot summer nights in the winterr
I’mma better my life till we all sit up
Since we are here we are live
Ye and I make you touch the sky[Intro]
I need 100 dollars, maybe a million

[Verse 1]
Waking up to credits, my life is a movie
Cocking back my prayers, no pressure can shoot me
Fashionably late, Givenchy can shoot me
A thousand miles per hour, that Bugatti is booty
Balling out I got coach, gold line on these hoes
Touchdown in they throat, you know how many fucking records I broke
Life’s moving too slow, future calling my phone
Angels on that voicemail, daddy please come home
It’s that trailer shit that I know, my dreams kicking in doors
Fuck the life that you chose, all the smoking mirrors I broke
Phil Jackson made the deal happen
Blowing up like it never happened
Never satisfied till I’m 55, Denzel of this rap shit!
Boasting all that big shit that your ho try to fuck me in
Top floor like anywhere, no entry point for your key to fiy
So high I talk to god and my androids can see the blink
Lord knows it is my time, lord knows that vacheron

[Hook]
This is anigma
Middle finger to you bitch niggas
This is anigma
Real niggas getting major figures

[Verse 2]
All the money and the cars, talk about it, talk about it
Everybody living large, talk about it, talk about it
All my real niggas in the building, talk about it, talk about it
All the bad women making noise, talk about it, talk about it
This is anigma, raised in hell, cooked in holy baking soda
87 dreams, woke you, out your fucking coma
It’s cold in the middle when the heat is on
Motherfuckers crowd around me, you just so they ain’t seen alone
First class for that Skype call, ease drop on my life dog
Swimming in the money i might fall
Scrooge McDuck that I drown all
I’m way down till I’m way up, my countdown like the ball struck
Four hoes all fucked up, four hoes all fucked up
Try to chase the liq' but that juice gon', fucked up, where the Goose go
Last night Greystone, last year I was at a house party
Same nigga, same crew, watch your girl before she blame you
I had her in the whip and she was on my dick, but I don’t give a fuck like it’s game two

[Bridge]
I’ve been on some other shits since day one
Ask me how I feel ho, amazing
Fantastic brilliant, spilling champagne on your bitch
Why you sing along on my shit, nigga?

[Hook]

[Outro]
All the money and the cars, talk about it, talk about it
It’s everybody living large, talk about it, talk about it
All my real niggas in the build’, talk about it, talk about it
All the bad women making noise, talk about it, talk about it[Chris Sutton]
Listen, I can make the Devil say Jesus
Got a crew full of leaders
So far ahead of y'all the sun sets between us
That could make you upset, you live beneath the sunset
Boy, I'm so fire, I could prob'ly make the sun sweat
Preme won't hit me back (?) I'm still runnin'
Drop me in the jungle watch me come out with a full stomach
Beats on the menu, sit me at the dinner table
Eat so many rappers I could shit out a record label
(?) ain't really the place to slang on
They gon' let the bullets tackle you like you got pads on
Rap circles 'round you niggas so fast I could start a sandstorm
Fall out the sky, and a star is what I land on
Ironically I'm cold as ever, hotter then a solar flare
If y'all cool...I guess that makes me a polar bear
You dont want (?) trust me no (?) for trying
Homie I was (?) kitty litter (?)
Everybodys swagged out, but you look like a bum, dummy
Yo my swag can take yo swag's lunch money

[XV]
It's been a long day, I went home an drank some bombay
Got my old girl tryna make-up, like stronjay
I'm just tryna get to a mil, I'm chasin' Andres
Stravin' artist, I'm rubbin' my belly like Beyonce
Crew move ways, press O's no latte(??)
And made three thousands like the madre of Andre
"You ain't like them other dudes", that's what my mom say
I was the crazy one in that group, DeVante
Do it the Don way, gettin' chips like picante
Rippin it down the parkway listenin the the (?)
I dont spit it I just kick it like conmatae(?)
Now they tryna put me in rings like a fiance
Square in the circle, don't call me Urkel
The Kid With the Green Backpack will leave you purple
So lets keep it verbal
Cause maybe not me but my entourage do keep shells, no turtle
Wichita, Kansas, yep that what he rep
On your B-E-T T-V sets, they need X
Cause I'm like a T-rex
Yo girl like a t-shirt
Cause everytime I step out she tryna give V-neck
Vizzy!

[Jay Rock]
I'm a rock in a hard place
Surrounded by smiles and they all fake
Show be the best, watch me still outshine(?)
Like the po-po did P Diddy in 99
You dont feel me, you fear me, thats the bottom line
I'm out my mind
I set up shop at the Promanade
Whoa, it's been a long time coming
I Guess I got the stamina for this rap and yo woman
My life is like chess the watchin my every move
Class in session, Jay take 'em to school
Spittin on tracks, nah (?) I (?)
Like a short yellow bus, big helmets and twos
I'm an animal, and this rap game is a zoo
Thought they were 'lympians, until they came to Zeus
Guess its in my genes, 'member (?)
Straight dope talkin right on B-E-T too
Rock!

[Gilbere Forte]
Im usually on some first name basis
But dudes mess my name up so much I wanna change it
A wise man told me to live what my mama gave me
A chance to see life outside of a lady
Yeah, we was born Kings, before I ever wrote it
History never written, If I ain't ever quote it
Your blog ain't ish, if I ain't ever post it
87 dreams on your baby girl tell em post it
I let a chick blow me down til she brain dead
Just to give her a lil taste of what fame is
Fly city to Illadel Im famous
Gilbere Forte tatted on the anus
Brought a chick on my right out stay whipping a Supra
Never watch the level (?)
You tryna touch the sky, I been sexin the clouds
You could die and go to heaven to see me once in a while
WowChorus:
I step up in this mother fucker all black chukkas
All, all black girl what, what’s really good
All black skully, y’all can’t tell me, nothin
No I said y’all can’t tell me

I, I step up in this motherfucker all black chukkas
Simple low all black form of comfort
Walk a million miles in a lifetime cuttin'
Surprisin by my rise and got me glidin up ya mind
We flyin through the sky just to feel high
Different time zones anywhere Ima be like
Supreme means of a dream the team riders is clean really rippin the scene

You know what I mean, you know you know what I mean
Out to get cream
Outta , outta get cream
The American dream we are on a big screen
So open your eyes and welcome to the live

(Chorus x2)

I’m fresh to def with a million scuffs
Through worn my white tee with my APC jeans
Black frames on complimentin the steez
Feelin so blessed God pressed my lean
Confidence through the roof couldn’t see it with a telescope
How you still talkin when all I hear is yellin for
Creatin the hype creates my height
Can’t Ichat so high I Skype
The leather on my taupe box means I’m right, right
You will never crease my life
Always ahead of my time never missin a flight
My chukkas all black but the whips all white

(Chorus x2)

Aye, aye
The label of our life keep us fly by night
Don’t accept checks if the commas ain’t right
The rubber on our sole worth more than its price
The way we break it down give us 25 to life
Uh, Straight off the wall, chin high 5.0 grind wishin I’d fall
Pause
You know how we are, fresh out the box, shoes never laced
Walkin in the way, walkin, walkin in the place
I look in your face and tell that you a sucka
You never understand how we get it in our chukkas, motherfuckers

(Chorus x2)[Verse 1: Big Krit]
A loser I could never be, the bottom I will never see
You walk, I bite, you run, I fight, bitch you know my pedigree
I cruise 'round with my chick, no Tec on this I put on car shows
Well sometimes niggas flex, I keep a stretcher in my car door
I work too hard to get caught up in the he say / she say bullshit
Chill, niggas talk lame tryna slander my name cause I fucked some chick they cool with
She smile in your face, but this shit's so great, meanin' she love my music
Top 5 dead or alive no doubt in her mind, she choose Krit
I parle with my partners reminisce on all the broke days
Was fiending for a bottle, scraping dollars, praying, hope pays
Now it's bourgeois models, baby, swallow up on this rose
The last one you expected to be king, Keyser Söze
K-R-I-T workin' wheel, swangin' til my tires peel
Candy coated raindrops on my whip, and bitch it's so for real
M-I crooked letter, ho, who you know do it better folk
Put it down for the south, the best
The only thing I will settle for

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
I talked about the plan before I lived it yo
Dreaming about this life that everybody thought I'd never know
I told my mama, my daddy, ain't want to lose hope
So I bottled up the spirit and I let go
Me and Raaks spent the summer making dreams off the kitchen floor
Folded up mattress for a seat, tryna mix the flow
16th and Willington, the Temple, that's what we represent
Whoever thought that we would meet the fuckin President?
And this is only half of what God meant
He gave me vision and a voice to tell the world
This living is not an option and dying is only a wish
Baiting out my heart for the world to go fish
Cause we living on the land where the richest man is the shit
Only the wisest ones are struggling to make sense
So I'm breaking every dollar for my soul to change this
The greatest rapper would be living if ya resurrected this

[Hook] x 2
Cause we gon work, work
Cause we gon work, work
Cause we gon work, work
Cause we gon work, work

Cause we gon work, work
Cause we gon work, work
Cause we gon work, work
(Keepin’ that black soul alive)

[Verse 3: Gilbere Forte]
24 years old
Sold everything just for angels to tell me give em more
Feel like I'm from another planet somewhere that NASA know
I rap about everything that you went to class for
College graduation high stakes you keep a nigga low
Too many unfinished miseries for me to support
3 months after 87 Dreams I was out the door
New York, the city where we go big
I left my old contacts and my Blackberry at the crib
Any moment I'mma make it I don't owe a nigga shit
I told Raak we gon do it and touch the fucking world
In any way we never knew it, the only way to prove it
No money off this music til the future bring us to it
So keep your head high, watching God get us through it
Settin' goals to tell a story that God ain't finish paging
Proofreadin' his glory of amazement, amazing!You lookin’ at game whats next
All the same players got a brand new dress
Praisin’ the wrong things don’t make you blessed
Just make you a victim of your own obsession
Infatuations with seeing your name printed on checks
Just cause of a co-sign it don’t make you next
Determined to blow up off another niggas rep
Praying for the right nigga to make a hard left
That’s insane when you was once in the rain claimin’ change
Now you settlin for change cause your shine ain’t the same
Mixtape after mixtape droppin reviving hip hops options, to forever stay stagnant
Regurgitate your substance and digest it for the masses
Superhero power but the flow is black magic
Darker than the cloak flyin over that black casket
Challenging my life Ima let you have it
There’s nothing in this world fake niggas can’t master
Disappearing from haters cause y’all won’t vanish
Reaching to the top got you stuck in the attic
What you see is what you get, feel the dramatics
Sha Money said I was a rapper’s rapper
But not the rapper worshiping his favorite dagger
Main weapon of choice choosing what you capture
Pushing for a sequel, symbolizing nothing equal
The root of all evil you growing through black people
Defamation of lifestyle what you consider the future
I been here and I am right now
A lot of people wonderin’ where the fuck did I come from, why I haven’t been out
Studyin my craft is something I always been bout
Just cause I’m from Phlip you thought I wouldn’t make it
If we all from the same struggle why is you hatin?
Got your whole life ahead of you, why would you fuckin’ waste it?
I done seen family come between dreams, keepin my blood tight like T Rod, just to be honest
The general told me music ain’t really what it seems
Shout outs to Darren D
The whole game lied to, suffering conditions
I’m the doctor that’s about to come, change your prescription
School of hard knocks, you should have paid attention
Or the principals of life will put your ass in detention
All you rap niggas wanna get in the game
But once you get in it watch your perceptions change
I’m fuckin Damien , Exorcist, Poltergeist
Aint’ nothing nice if you willin to pay the price
Head spinnin walking down the stairs ass backwards
Just to get the single of the year that’s backwards
Call the game Hollywood, wrestling matches
Most of your favorite rappers is developing actors
OG Blaze said I told you heavy
Less than one year he’s on the road already
Surrounded by the elders with old jewels and slick tongue rap
Original gangsters with OG chin straps
Old heads callin me the new cat daddy
Philly slang young boy, Broad street alley
I’m on my Young Chris Philly shit
Huh? The home of the spitters bitch
North Philly South Philly, West philly nigga shit
Big wore Versaces, Cool Gs, linens
I wear Versace no socks in my Timberlands
We all mad the street wear ain’t the same
Supreme lifestyle but a staple in the game
I’m about to shut the door in approximately ten minutes
If you ain’t getting in now you aint’ getting in then
They said Black Chukkas was a shot in the dark
How the fuck did it make it to 106 & Park?
The real A&Rs recognize real stars
Hating on a nigga just makes you a broad
I got the streets and the industry buzzin, Rome
? I could go down the whole list all night
Whoever thought 87 Dreams would ever reach heights
Matter fact if it would reach flights
And I’m not one to brag, but this is what really happens to a yougin with class
Passed before, but I never asked for the torch
Who said a bitter war couldn’t make it behind closed doors
I’m not into publicizing shit that I can’t afford
How do I lose something that I ain’t never had?
If opportunity comes knockin I ain’t afraid to pass
I’m not trying to be the next #1….2, 3, 4, 5
Huh? None
Mos Def is Mr. Miagi, I am Daniel’s son
Mastering my artistry I’m the last dragon
Fight out of this world, shogun couldn’t fathom
I am only 23 on the verge for seven rings
Living out the life Martin Luther had dreamed
87 motherfuckers[Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
Look up in the sky, fuck a plane I am higher than
12 ODs from a fiend, I’m inspiring
No holds barred for your dreams, would you die for them?
Kill for them? Put ‘em all on the line?
Break ‘em down and rebuild with ‘em?
You haters jumped the roof and find destiny with your face down
Me and Tyga burn ‘em up before we burn ‘em up
Grade A fire flame, you can spark a lighter
Watch the world say who I’m hotter than
Now you know who they hate now, I’m awake now
I’m forever dreaming, you dying where you been sleeping
Stuck in them pipe dreams where you was destined to be in
Nightmares on Elm Street where Freddy meets his demons, demons
I’m on a rise and never far from the gods
So when I walk through the pain, reality’s just a stain
The eyes of the truth can see it all if you blinded
And if Pac were still around, I’mma be the one to ride for ‘em

[Hook: Raak]
I stepped into this life where I wanna be, all the fucking things that I dreamed of
I’m here now so what else can you tell me huh? I’m here now motherfucker
Yeah I been sitting on the clouds, trying to make you proud
Tell me why the motherfuckers wanna burn me down
Tell me why the motherfuckers wanna burn me down
Tell me why the motherfuckers wanna uh yeah

[Verse Two: Tyga]
Burn me down, hundred rounds, run you down
Ra-pa-pum, automatic, run through your fucking town
Bound to get out of bounds, boy, don’t you fuck around
Round merry-go-round, rosaries if you should be found
Peace, love, sending flowers to mothers and daughters
Me and money vowed together in holy matrimony
Take it from me, break your leg, now they call you Tony
Scar your face, now you the real Tony, crazy chemist in the lab
Evil laugh, needle cab, push your face into the glass
Chop you fast, body bag, let it drag, Brillo pass
Scrape your ass, put your blood up in the flag
This that type of shit that I’m gonna do, marijuana you
I smoke you fools, I overlap and I overdo, number one
Never number two, motherfuckers can’t get over it
Pow, pow, you sober yet? Pow, pow, it’s over bitch

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Gilbere Forte]
You can bring the flames, I’mma bring the snowstorm
Knock ‘em down one at a time, riot bomb
You quiet, calm, I’m setting off all the alarms
Pussy getting, negative, you somewhere watching quiet porn
Bitch, try to burn me down, well here’s my light, good luck motherfucker
I am gone to another light no money can price
Try to take my bitch, impound your wife, I’mma pound her twice
With four, five dykes, the money ain’t shit till I make it rich
Got a pocket full of dreams that you could never sleep on
You allergic to money motherfucker, get your sneeze on
My life’s a flat chick that I’mma throw some D’s on
Your life’s a dirty whore steady getting peed on
You old news, fucking the past years, I’m in new clothes
You stuck in my last years, if this is now, I’m stuck up in the clouds
You can keep the fucking crown, I’m burning the castle down bitch

[Hook][Bridge]
I’ve seen a lot of people change when they’re with the wrong people
Killing off their friends just to feel a little equal
First they say “fuck you”, then they say they fucking need you,
Life is such a movie, so we’re about to live the sequel

[Hook]
She’s double cupped up, she faded
Taking time, living life the way she made it
She’s double cupped up, she faded
That’s why I power shit, pimp nigger swaying
She’s double cupped up
Cadillac music, top down way, crusin
She’s double cupped up
Just riding slow, I’m riding home

[Verse 1]
It was this chick that I knew from 2006
Graduated, made it from a college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch, you know me
Trying to act solo, down low, hush hush you low key, shit
I thought I was your homie, hate your friends
Till the night you tried to fuck me in the back of your man’s Benz
But I get the plan and I smoke the pussy and I get the frame
And I fuck the brains, swimming all along till she caught remote, try saying my name
And I’ve been all in your business, girl
But I wish you the best all in your dreamworld

But I know it’s hard being single with a body
Got a million eyes on you, don’t know which one is the lottery
Chasing your next moves for opportunities
Monogamy, you want it all and think about it when you’re gone
Cause honestly your past is a future of its own

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It was 11 and below PM
Slide low in a ‘Lac till I see him
See, I see why I met you
Hoes still so lavish
Nothing but the best ho, chopped n screwed Tiesto
Europenos, bet that she knows, white girl is for that black love
I’m feeling that adrenaline rush when I’m feeling along your bum
Feeling like I wanna fuck, is you really worth this nut?
Pillow behind my head, cause I like the feeling of it
Oh, what a wonderful feeling when she sucking me off the edge.
Shup up that paper hold, chop up that paper hold
Just watch your teeth, though, and do it to the beat slow
To the tempo, instrumental, I see when blow smoking, therefore I ain’t hear what you’re saying
Time don’t make the money, but my time is for the rich
Pockets feel like 8ball, bitches call me Mr. Big, Mr. Big
You hear what the fuck I say?
A lot of people change when their world starts to split
I take the money while you chop the leaves

[Bridge]

[Hook]Oh oh, oh oh, ooooooooh
Oh oh, oh oh, ooooooooh

[Hook]
This is for my niggas that's down for the ride
Down for the ride, down for the ride
And the girls that's bout that life
Bout that life, bout that life
One time for the ride, time for the ride
Time for the ride, two times for the life
Time for the life, time for the life
This is for the dreams that we've been chasin'
And now that we're here, there's no more waitin', oooh

[Verse 1]
First off, I been on the wave tryna surf off
Takin' every moment I heard off, tryna cash in chips for the payoff
Takeoff, to the places that I seen now
True life, real nigga, I'm a stay down
Tell my team from arenas to the playground
Hey now, never lost myself girl
You worth more than what you bought yourself
You a boss yourself, do it in them heels
Girl know your size, do it for the ladies that's down to ride
I'mma do it for my niggas that's bout that life
Til we all up there, top floor
Where a hater can't call us there
Yeah seat back, just rollin'

[Hook]
This is for my niggas that's down for the ride
Down for the ride, down for the ride
And the girls that's bout that life
Bout that life, bout that life
One time for the ride, time for the ride
Time for the ride, two times for the life
Time for the life, time for the life
This is for the dreams that we've been chasin'
And now that we're here, there's no more waitin', oooh

[Verse 2]
Yeah G, it's all on you
Do it for the woman that's waitin' on you
She savin' it, she savin' it
Never do a thing you ain't supposed to do
Hey you, got a heart of a lion
Soul of a nigga named Pac that rhyme
Don't take no shit, tell a nigga
To his face, you ain't no bitch
Go harder, it's your time
Think about the dreams you aim high
Think about the cars you ain't drive
Think about the women in your life
That's down to ride, that's down to fuck
Keep it on the low who talk much
Champagne with your niggas that stayed around
Them first class flights y'all made around
Stay you, stay true
Fuck everything they tell you
Roll up, burn slow
Pass that, seat back
Fuck that, po' po'
I'm coastin', today was a good day
Black 3's in the dash rollin'
Memories makin' them moments
Got damn you know I'mma own it

[Bridge]
It's your time, it's your time
Tellin' all my niggas it's no time
It's go time, it's go time
Tell me what you know about that
This is for my niggas that
It's your time, it's your time
Tellin' all my niggas it's no time
It's go time, it's go time
So tell me what you know about that

[Hook]
This is for my niggas that's down for the ride
Down for the ride, down for the ride
And the girls that's bout that life
Bout that life, bout that life
One time for the ride, time for the ride
Time for the ride, two times for the life
Time for the life, time for the life
This is for the dreams that we've been chasin' (this is for the dreamers)
And now that we're here, there's no more waitin', oooh

Now we're livin', livin', livin' girl
Livin', livin', livin' girl
Livin', livin', livin' girl, oooh[Intro]
To stand for a dream I fall to my knees
You fall for nothing, you fall for nothing

[Verse 1]
I remember when it all took off
Spiritual high, flowing till a nigga dose off
Face down in a sofa Ikea, ain’t comfortable at all
I feel it in the air, I ain’t even get it started at all
Life’s too short like Todd Shaw
Daydream into my nightmares call
I’m so high I’m beside myself
Out of body try to find myself
I’m half dead, I’m still high
No heartbeat to my drum line
I thought I was over my dead lines
Last night was a warrior, I walk up to the coroner

[Hook]
Cause in the night she calls to me
She never leaves me alone
And I fall to my knees for the dream
And baby, you fall for nothing
You fall for nothing
You fall for nothing

[Verse 2]
Did you ever think you lost me?
Try to fight conscious when you saw me
Whoever thought being high was haunting
Whoever thought this life will cost me?
Try to recess a nigga, no insurance to protect a nigga
A victim of euphoria, when the cops come just change the story up
They’ve got 24 hours to arrest me
When life is on the run, they don’t catch me
And none of this was expected, why I ain’t get the message?
Is this one of God’s blessings? Did the Devil ever read his texts?
If you leave me what will you be left with?
I throw my life away, would you catch it?

[Bridge]
May your will, will be done
May your past be forgiven
May you find heaven
May you find heaven

[Hook]
Cause in night she calls to me
She never leaves me alone
And I fall to my knees for the dream
And baby, you fall for nothing
You fall for nothing
You fall for nothing

[Verse 3]
I thought I’d die when my momma gave birth
So I kiss her every time my life hurts
I’m a gift to the world and part of me is a curse
Never baptized but God gave me the church
Last one living if I was to die first
I’m forgiven if I was to cry first
I know to get in it could’ve been all worse
Walking in the clouds but my shoes in the dirt, man
Hearing all my last thoughts
These are my first words
Hearing all my last lines for the motherfucking first time
Hood over my eyes, walking thin lines
Fall into my leads, damage to the time
Twenty five years having praying for mine
Twenty five years having praying for mine, nigga
Above my head till I rest before all
A line on a dream I never thought will save me
Play hide and seek when haters try to chase me
I’m too young for great hits so find me
Now my memories are dying from Alzheimer’s
They said the greatest come in small sizes
One bullet go down with all timers, bang!
The late grace, dark shades, gray ends send me through my dark days
The peoples, the evils and everything before it
I kill raak, how the fuck is he gon' record it
Too much value that haters couldn’t afford it
Too much power, the haters couldn’t ignore it
The city I’m riding through like everything mine
I couldn’t get a dime, now they’re blowing through my lines
Now they’re blowing through my lines, one sniff at a time[Verse 1]
You gave me your heart, I let you borrow mine
We sharing sodas in the mall when it’s shopping time
I open doors for you when you walk in fine line
Staring at your ass in those hills looking prime-time
Checking my pose, measuring my vital signs
Pregain for your heart, got to play you on your side line
It’s feeling any good or is it all bad?
Cause I’m used to getting love to a woman I shouldn’t have
She blew it for what I granted, left for dead
Tell me, is it real as they say it is?
A big house, wide fences and some happy kids
I was always told to give away this daily shit
When I was only trying to find peace
So realize it, what actually found me
I open books to a story that I can never close
No ordinary ass swinging on that pole
But a life full of stories standing over five o
Meet me on the red moon, 20 94
Always at it soon, I wait a few years more
Forever young we are, just waiting for the stars
Why chase it when it’s right in front of your face so how bizarre
Let me be your spinning wheel while you sit in your car
I thought the love of you has never felt far
Cause you embodied the love of god I wanted to explore

[Hook]
We are close to a story of a love, a dream I don’t wanna wake up
And we are close, the hunt of a love you keep as yours forever
Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever

[Verse 2]
They say a star was born, well how they found me
I close my heart to every woman trying to sign me
The labels on your ass don’t mean nothing to my audiostry
What a hunger for love, your insecurity is starving me
So how hard was it hard to be
Perfect angel god made when he thought of me
You wanted to be my first, but knew it never last
Gave you time I never had, but you kept the worst part of me
You’re best when trying to fuck me and now made it hard for me
To be honest when my honesty was overlooked
If I could kill memories and never go to jail
I’d still be your heaven that you considered your hell
So what I fell for you and look now where I landed
I wouldn’t caught the same flight if I knew we was crashing
Down for what we had to live forward we were had
To give up where I’m at to bring you back from the past
Autumn Sunday morning spending breakfast waxing ass
Got you calling out my name, I ain’t saying nothing back
Cause your pussy feeling like the summer wind, I’m falling back
Pulling threads out the mattress while I’m blowing at your ass
Fucking up your emotions when you’re bound to get married
Telling me it’s all for you to chose when the options was meant to vary
Calling me the certain time your pussy brings the jelly
Cause you living without a friend in your 20s feeling 30

[Hook]
We are close to a story of a love, a dream I don’t wanna wake up
And we are close, the hunt of a love you keep as yours forever
Forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, foreverWe ownin', muthafuckin' rollin', ain't nobody fuckin' with my--

[Hook: Gilbere Forte]
It's hot in this bitch, you could be the fan
Try to cool me off, cool me off like damn
Said it's hot in this bitch, you could be the fan
Try to cool me off, cool me off like
Fli Ci in this bitch, you could be the fan
Try to cool me off, cool me off like damn
Said it's hot in this bitch, you could be the fan
Try to cool me off, cool me off like damn

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Harlem, big trucks like ?
I rock the big watch with the flooded band
I got niggas from the motherland
In the winter you could catch him with a summer tan
I whip the ghost like a go-kart
So then it's tell me when the show starts
I'm coming out flooded like Noah's ark
And fuck the light cause you know my wrist glow in the dark
You niggas stylin' but you fake wildin'
We four warriors deep when we on ?
They tryna cool me off like antifreeze
But I'm hot like the shots when the hammer squeeze

[Hook B]

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
Hold up, it's a new kid on the block
Waited 87 dreams for me to get my shot
With a mean grill you could picture my drop
When I ride through everything just stop
Back on the gas, way ahead of my class
See the pipes burning from the bikes on the Ave
So ahead of my life I let my grandson have
The whole fucking world, I just throw it in the bag
Midwest kid with flows for all ages
Barbershop clean, nutcracker type flavors
Big ? Versace's, Coogi's, linens
I'll wear Versace's, no socks in my Timberlands
I'm hot like the chicken off the Halal trucks
You a latte nigga cause I'm getting star bucks
I'm live on the set, the bass brought the streets out
It's hot in this bitch, y'all niggas send a tweet out

[Hook B]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
It's hot in this bitch, the Gullwing's a sauna
The leather just stick to my skin like Under Armour
Ride with a material girl, the black Madonna
Face like a virgin, she wants me to Lucky Star her
I'm lovin' her aura, shearling by Zara
She take me as I am, tossing weight like Toccara
Decapitated SL's and Audi SLR-a
The last samurai to your roof, sayonara
Eghck! Blood sweat and tears
Through the years, now the new found fame, I call it karma
These niggas bipolar, I'm who they love to hate
Praying for my downfall, now they chalk it up to fate
I chalk it up to chalking up the plate that I scrape
Peyton Manning Arm & Hammer with the plays that I make
NFL, that's No Fucking Losses
A great defense makes an even better offense

We ownin', muthafuckin' rollin', ain't nobody fuckin' with my--[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]
Fucked up, last night, slept with a chick from my past life
Past twice, the homies hit, but I was never really all in that bitch
Bad brains, but I ain't sippin' I'm still tippin' off how it goes
Lost in the valley of some fines hoes, I'm stuck in homeboys condo
Left the keys to the S600, nigga like me I ain't gon' front it
So I hit my man T Coles and we 'bout to hit the road
Headed for Vegas where lights and the money take us
It's hard being humble when you know you 'bout to blow
I think I have trouble listening to my spirit
Heart across I think about noone near me that hear it
Head from a chick I don't know, I'll probably clear it
Swervin' off my ego, but honesty's what I'm fearin'
I knowin' what car I need for all the lies I am st
With all these people around me
For emotions and my music but safety for their investments
Friendships with business where can I find the exit
Every dollar that I spent, every night I call the phone
It's property tax when you ain't livin' at home
All these bitches that surround me, not sure ho-ho-how they found me
It's balance between being alive or being a lie
Truth can hurt everybody but who the fuck will survive
If I told you something I wasn't you'd probably say I'm the shit
If I told you I'm nothing better you'd tell me get off my dick
The backwards way of living will never reach its limit
You can spend your life in a bubble trying being humble
But it's only so long before anybody'll buckle
Everybody around you steady feeding your accomplishments
Your ego ain't the most of it when you the type of nigga that never notices
When the money's right, smiles come out the dark
Everybody that wanna know you will play the part
And get closer to the moment before you was shinin' at all
The luxuries of life will never stop 'til you fall
We all young living vices for advices
Where the humble niggas die just swaggin' and put the knife in it
The value of being young with a dream, who's motherfucking pricing it

Yeah, Forte
Raak, I don't know how long I'mma let them live with this beat
What I got on my feet nigga, Android Hommes nigga

[Outro][Verse One: Gilbere Forte]
I’m usually on some first name basis
But niggas fuck my name up so much, I wanna change it
A wise man told me to live what my mama gave me
A chance to see life outside of a lady
I’m 24 now, no rain in my clouds so my sky stay true
Purer than ice blue, when you closer to your dreams
People that surround you start hating on your team
They wanna wear a crown too
You try to chase a life that don’t wanna find you
It’s hard to gain credit for something that’s not you
The price people paying to make it as a fan
Keep you closer to the game but you lost in the stands
I ain’t no missionary but your girl love dictionary
It’s clear that I’m able to tell it all
The truth is a weapon, I’m the quickest on the draw
Race a life and playing chicken, I ain’t getting out the car bitch

[Hook]
You riding so cold, treble real low, bass keep thumping, we nodding
Niggas turned up, smoke in the air, Kush rolled up, we mobbing
You riding so cold, treble real low, bass keep thumping, we nodding
Niggas turned up, smoke in the air, Kush rolled up, we mobbing

[Verse Two: Droop-E]
Me, I’m a pro, they? Proteges, I’m from the Bay
I got more game than Milton Bradley
Sadly, I tell you a lot of these fools fakers
No soul like some Chuck Taylors, high in the sky
Smoking cherry pie on a flight, red eye
Land at 11:45, I tell her relax, recline, kick back like recoil
Now she spoiled, it’s a wrap like foil
Shout out to rapping forte, Gilbere and E-40
The sick with it lieutenant about to bring it back like Rogaine
The niggas square like cubicles, girl, you beautiful
From your hair to your cuticles, uh, I was built for this
I was born in this shit, I was made for this uh
I don’t think y’all understand, since H3, already been a made man

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Casey Veggies]
Homie, my generation fucked over, I give out luck to four leaf clovers
At least I can save up, cop a Range Rover, got a chick in the back
And she a grade over, a little older ‘cause I’m fresher than a Folgers
My girls all in the front row, they all having good times
Wrote it down, took ten minutes to spit all good rhymes
Just trying to shine my nigga, I’m three years strong on that grind my nigga
One hand to the sky for those no longer with us
All daps and handshakes, if you paying, you’ll get us
Girl, if you come to the hotel, you laying with winners
And Inglewood killing but I stay away from splinters
And niggas hating on it ‘cause they can’t ball with us
Girl, you know that you come here and take your pictures
I’m a star, I would too if I was you especially that I know what I’m gon’ do, Veggies

[Hook 2X][Hook: Active Child]
Everything reminds me of you
I think I’m losing my mind
Staring at your face in the rearview
And I can get all of the time
Nolita, Nolita
Nolita
Nolita, Nolita

[Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]
Yea, lookin back on a life that I thought that I could never have
Spent time with a woman I thought that I could never match
Broke all my ties to the chick that caught them feelings fast
I fall in love to that mother skunker, jumped all on my back
That’s when I meet you, the girl with the dragon tattoo
Black eyes, cold hips in a black coupe
With that fast zoom and that Vera Wang
In them Christian Lou's
With a voice full of heaven I stand to lose
With a heart to say I don’t steal shit
I'm a real bitch
Independent, no dick goin' make me kill this
So pressed up on her
Ride right at the moment, she said if you want it
You better holy matrimony, woah
I’m cool, rolling with them punches
But I’m only down for your loving
Back rub when we cuddling
My thug passion, you be lovin it
Get lost in the town, we make the time
That’s when it all happen, champagne glasses
Drunk off passion
With a little bit of lust and a little bit of you
And a little bit of face sucking off this mood
You keep your head down with no panties on
Adina Howard with no cameras on
Your light’s low but your body's on
You tie me to the bed post
Fuckin me off the edge though
Bathtub, hot salt water
Rose pedals with that blunted sour
Talkin' dirty in the darkest hour
With all of my best
I put your engagement ring on the desk
Everything was set
But then you left

[Hook: Active Child]

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
I was left in the dark
I was left in the cold
I was left getting old
With no idea why you kept a secret so long
It’s been three years since I’ve seen you
And my heartbeat still needs you
I can’t find a number to reach you
And your whereabouts to meet you
So I gave up, hit the road
Concert after concert
And city after city, getting drunk with some stupid hoes
Ridin through the city with the big lights
Downtown, tryna feel life
In a glora kadan with a glass of Henny
And a bad chick to my right
Smellin like my past
What the fuck’s in my drink
When I realized what I’m next to
Matching dragon tattoos
It was you, it was you all along
And you was fuckin' yo ex girl
A body of lies and I’m blessed girl
And I hate loving yo sex girl
I was yo experiment but I died, you kicked dirt on my grave
And for what? To get a taste for dick you fuckin bitch

[Bridge: Active Child]
Everything reminds me of you
I think I’m losing my mind
Staring at your face in the rearview
And I can get

[Hook: Active Child]

[Outro: Active Child and Gilbere Forte]
Nolita, Nolita
Nolita
Fucked up
You know, I ain’t even really
See it comin from somebody like that
You know I never liked love
I fuckin hate me[Verse 1]
You are my light, you are my dark
You are forever my sin
While my dogs don't talk and my lips don't walk
You are forever my pin
While my eyes roll black when I highs I got blowing that mary lich
With the doctor try to describe me
Man it feel like I lost my mind
I'm unconscious, but I'm breathing
Thought ever pinch between now what is sleeping
A young boy with a man's heart, in a women world
Thought I found victim of addiction, in a vixen
Tryina send in contradiction
Talking bout now all the people's opinions
But why fuck love with a condom
To go raw when I'm out here lost
And y'all niggas tryna live trill
But go crazy when the shit get real
When the pain calls back from the head I got
From the bad bitches, sleep, sleep, nap, nap
She suck my soul, that's why don't let me the god I kept in the sack
A victim of missing you, a victim of pissing true

[Hook]
And in my mind, in my head
Is this where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
Is this where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Bridge]
Make me feel like I lost my mind (x8)

[Verse 2]
Start wicked to a coast '
Cause I'm wicked to the achin to my own regrets
Never try to hold in when you know it's best
But I only know this wrong
She got the body of a god, I only notice it's raw
My man said dog, it will be all good
Pussy run the world but the track suit on
Nike Roshe, just don't make it into cold and oj
But she sip through foreplay, letting you realize you done fucked for 4 days
Then she said she pregnant, you ain't seen her in 4 days, damn
Get it all been worse, dedicated to a chick that flirts
She tries to turn it down, but the way it don't work
You an athiest, try to find some truth in church
So you walk in, pastor talking like he a master
You don't listen to him, then you a bastard
Living life with a growl pain, you forget to nodes thangs
Fars as rio, me with the women I be, fantasizing
Beyond whatever you been imagining

[Hook]
And in my mind, in my head
Is this where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head
Is this where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

Make me feel like I lost my mind [x8][Intro]
Yeah
My daddy was born ready, I was ready

[Verse 1]
Your time of death, my cost of living
Michigan/Philly nigga, red, white Jordan 6's
Went to school in the 'burbs, but that make no difference
White boys on my team go harder then niggas
We the best in the game, but yo coach ain't never listen
Unsigned like a motherfucka, now that the labels fishing
Signed a deal a year ago, got out of it cuz I ain't feel the dough
Got a cool mil off "Black Chukkas", I know yo but I'm cool bro

All black, all black, all black! (My nigga)
But you anointed Christian
Yo mama dressed you for church nigga, who you kiddin?
Dick-in-the-booty ass niggas, you must be shittin'
They say I'm the greatest in the world, but I'm tryna live it
40 ounce got all the bitches, P.G county got all the bitches
I’m a trill nigga, in Hilfiger, my style leave you end up missing
Fashion killer...Paris life I'm with Bob Sinclar...(get it?)
3000 electrolytes
Walk hard and my soul glow, 3000 electro lights
Got coke lines in the bathroom, baddest bitches live the wild life
Tall bitches give the best head, standing up on my bed
I drive a go cart through the shopping mall
Staring up skirts: no draws
Cruising in front of your bitch, parking her whip
Talking and gawking the kid, arguing 'bout shit
Both of y’all need to get off of my dick, dick
A nigga came too far, to live a lie
I die young...to be still alive

[Hook]
Let us pray, let us pray, let us pray
Let us pray, let us pray, let us pray

[Verse 2]
Who will survive in America, on the top floor of hysteria
Looking down to my life, like how the fuck did I marry her?
Life’s a bitch but she suck a good dick
Ass fatter than the bottom of a Benz, sitting on low 23 inch
Shoosh!, belly of the beast, I ain’t hungry though
Vegan life for you pork rolls, En Noir leather short flow
Android Homme when I walk (cold), Balmain sweater when I’m laying low
I'm on a balcony blowing halo's
With Topo Chico by the case load, staring at life tryna drink slow
One day I'mma ball like, Jay-Dub and Susu
On a private jet to that red moon, Instagram on my phone too
On a plane wildin out making babies
Goddamn I must be crazy (nigga)
Fucking like I'm in the 80s (nigga), 87 I was that baby (wooo)
Bombs bombs blown away
My swag done fucked yo hoes away
I style myself put your clothes away
Raak killed the beat, thats a throw away
Can't find the body muthafuckin cold case, fuck everybody
Young OG…middle finger to niggas dick riding me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I wear my heart on my chest, ffffuck yo necklace, fuck yo necklace
Turning my phone off, ffffuck yo texts, fuck yo texts
My daddy dead, I was born a blessing, born a blessing
Summer time in '92, back seat, I was rolling Benzes (Swerve!)
Clio Road, to that Southside, I’m coming home, at Grammy time
So my grandma know I still ride, for my blood, I will die
Forte and Bryant, I'm so king nigga kiss my highness
En Noir life, you niggas get from round us (wooo)
Nigga! You think this the death of a dynasty
This art of war, Raak and DeNiro beside of me, I’ve been quiet too long
JWhi nigga pass that loud, smoking on that heaven
Can you see them clouds?

[Let us pray][Verse 1: Gilbere Forte]
Still alive, but no rest
Cold nightmares, but no sweat
Her reality of her, I can’t stand next
To anything she shattered
Trying to swallow pain with no bladder
Steady rising from the feet with no ladder
Seeing death in the eye wouldn't matter
To only realize that when I give a life
My love gave birth
To the feeling that this was God’s plan
Earth wind and fire, powers of the lands
As we walked hand in hand
With the Earth but the sun cried
Cause your talk for forever was your lie
Was it worth it to let me die
I’m still standing from love’s crime

[Hook: Adele]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
’Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
’Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

[Verse 2: Gilbere Forte]
A life in the world with no demands
A life of pride could never stand a chance
A flight I take to see a heartland
Every love deserves to see what truth can
Bring the light, no matter the dark fight
Dropping in, your hero, saving you from the night
You told me what your eye touch
No Ipod, staring in your eyes
With just no trust
Your mind was already been made up
Windows to your soul but can’t tint it
Reminisce, what we had was fermented
Drunk in my thoughts and vision
I close my eyes, the angels want me to listen
To my heart, the only thing that was missing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gilbere Forte]
So many chances, so many answers
The reason we are far from advantage
The reason we go away to manage
The way we feel about love, about life
And all the things in it, I said it before
Before the plan was written
Giving a life what it has given me
To help you make this difference

[Hook][Verse 1]
Staring at the lights too long will make a dream go blind
Living a normal life too long when I ain’t got time
Everything feels like a cut-close, and everything is where a nigga go
Fuck being at this money humble, with every road block I'mma tumble
The whole fucking world wanna see me win
The shit I ain’t know but to the blessings in
I’m 30 seconds from Mars in a black Benz
Forming the pause in white leather, black tear
Ménage is cold as a motherfucking ice box
I rose from the dark, found this life false
Tell it on a risk, I could never miss a nice watch
Always evaluate your life before the price rock

[Pre Hook]
Spend my life inside the cell
I guess I had some boring tale
Spend my life inside the cell
I guess I had some boring tale

[Hook]
The streets keep flashing in my mind
The streets keep flashing in my mind, mind, mind
The streets keep flashing in my mind
The streets keep flashing in my mind, mind, mind
My love can hardly rest your name, name, name
My love can hardly rest your name, name, name

[Verse 2]
Young world, turn on your Tivo
Down reconnect you to my ego
Cause I ain’t never like most people
Everyday’s a Friday, knocking out Debo
Bitch I’m from the ‘90s, this is my stylo
Roll like the pussy from the farm close
Keys to the city got me running through these K-Holes
Life’s faster when you think slow
Day after day I tend to sing more
Deep in the dreams I miss sleep
For waking up alone, where does she go?
Voicemails talk to me when I need to know
But when I need to know is when I need to go
Work from everyday, long gone home
Botswana to Monaco, this is my assembly, you can keep the keys to the condo

[Bridge]
You are used to me
Same motherfucker that I used to be
Same black leather on the cope white seats
Everywhere I go living proof to me
I am never wrong, you’re never true to me
Now I’m on a plane, you didn’t fly to see
Swallowing the pain you give to me
Will you pay for it, nigga? Open your eyes for me
Wishing I’ll never see what I’m trying to reach
Not that I think out the rail way to me
Holding with a highway to heaven where my life’s off
Running out of gas, so I’m starting off

[Hook]
