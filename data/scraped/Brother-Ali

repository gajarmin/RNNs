[Intro: Brother Ali]
Said they just don't make 'em like this no more
In fact they never made 'em like this before
I'm 'bout the baddest man that ya eyes done saw
Baby, I'm down by law

[Hook]
Dangerous

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
Life gave me nothing free, but my ugly
Ass mug and a couple of fat nuts to squeeze
Dick dangling down in my dungarees
Hungry beast, I'll chase your ass up a tree
You know what's up with me, I'm sucker-free
Not uptown or uppity, it's not my cup of tea
Feared one in the streets, won't nothing bleed
Except my knuckle meat, caught up in your fucking teeth
Brother, please, I'm out here rhyming for survival
Plus I got a outta-body-mind-blowing live show
Squad of fine dimes follow me wherever I go
Got them on their knees trying to honor my arrival
Quick Draw McGraw, this mic of mine, I'm a prime time pridaw
Down by lidaw, broke dick, big dog
Who the hell am I? The A, the L, the I, and I’m the God damn shit, y'all

[Hook]
Dangerous
You should see me swing the jimmy

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Don't get me started
I'm golden era, '88 baby highly regarded
I get stupid, dookie, doo-doo, def, dumb, retarded
Watch you fade like a high top when I drop
Leave you flattened like a pancake at IHOP
With a pistol I'm a nice shot
Many battles are losable, losing isn't unusual
Life is brutal, but beautiful, birth allude to a funeral
I'm straight raw, cocaine natural
You that flesh-eating veterinarian drug used to de-worm cattle
The same way Big flipped mics I'mma show you how I run things
I'm the Don: Corleone, Cornelius, Trump, King
Is the world yours or mine? I'm an immortal in his prime
Structure doesn't follow the corporate design
I'm snapping your porcelain spine
To deep for the mortal mind every time I'm recording a rhyme
They find that I'm crossing the line
If you're blind and ignoring the grind
It’s sickening, ain’t a chick alive I won’t stick my dick in
I'm more shameless than Hammer dancing for popcorn chicken
Ace was the ink before Irv Gotti was laundering loot
And he dropped Slaughtahouse before they was ever forming a group
Fuck being miserable, whether it's the mental or in the flesh physical
Blessed are the poor in spirit
Yeah, I took it Biblical, I'm so dangerous

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
When this mic's in my hand I'm a cannibal man
Eat my own kind, damn, I'm an animal, fam
And if you a grown man then stand if you can
On your own two feet with a tangible plan
Now my plan's ripping them all, never fall
And achieve all goals like I'm kicking a ball
Like taking out your dick in the mall
Want everyone to see that it's me and I'm sicker than y'all
And this track's like a brick in the jaw, a bat to the head
Go ahead, get back in the bed
Keep sleeping, I'll be the nightmare of your dreams
Spit right, the flow's tight like a pair of your jeans
Take those off, y'all dudes feminine style, so foul
Meanwhile, men, women, and child praise me, the epitome of the best
Deadly like three in the chest, dangerous

[Hook]And yo whatever comes up comes out
We don't put our hands over our mouth
And whatever comes up comes out
We don't put our hands over our mouth
Whatever comes up comes out
(Please mister bass-man lay it on me)

Ayo, dependin' on the day, and dependin' on what I ate
I'm anywhere from twenty to thirty-five pounds overweight
I got red eyes and one of em's lazy
And they both squint when the sun shines so I look crazy
I'm albino man, I know I'm pink and pale
And I'm hairy as hell, everywhere but fingernails
I shave a cranium that ain't quite shaped right
Face type: shiny, I stay up and write late nights
My wardrobe is jeans and faded shirts
A mixture of what I like, and what I wear to work
I'm not mean and got a neck full of razor bumps
I'm not the classic profile of what the ladies want
You might think I'm depressed as can be
But when I look in the mirror, I see sexy ass me
And if that's somethin' that you can't respect then that's peace
My life's better without you actually
To everyone out there, who's a little different
I say damn a magazine, these is God's fingerprints
You can call me ugly but can't take nothing from me
I am what I am doctor you ain't gotta love me

[Spoken]
If you would please turn in your bible
To beauty tips according to Forest Whitiker
In the third chapter of the third line
Brother Ali would you please read to the choir for me son

[Hook](x3)
I'mma be all right, you ain't gotta be my friend tonight (you ain't gotta love me)
An I'mma be okay, you would probably bore me anyway (you ain't gotta love me)

Forest Whitiker y'all[Intro]
Like anybody, I would like to live — a long life; longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at, it always follows you where you are
And it's hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But it's harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically running from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South: I respect their vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of America's vision
They want us dancing, cooning and hollering
Only respect us for playing sports and modeling
More than racism: it's stay in your place-ism
More people are trapped in practical blackface-ism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
It's between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house

[Hook: Chuck D]
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowing the occupation
The annihilation of mental colonization

Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Trying to survive cultural assassination

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Crip niggas, Blood niggas, eses, Asians
Why the fuck we warring with each other's population?
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation, why the separation?
Why we got Jamaicans hating on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations?
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other, straight hating
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom, be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness of what I'm saying
You gotta recognize another G ain't the enemy
When the police ride, they kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G, then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets, we should really end war

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
Our hearts were torn apart just like y'all was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Everytime we called your office you ignored us
Now you holding hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us, ask if we're jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think Patrick said it best: Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence, you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only pure when they're applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Heard you need putting fear inside your heart
Make you burn Qu'rans and tell me not to build a mosque
Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you? Civil war[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
All these days I’ve been broken and hopeless
And I, and I don’t feel like I’m coping, I’m hoping
That I, that I can live and let go
So I can get through it
Yeah, I can live and let go
So I can get through this

[Verse 1: Suffa]
You know the pain can
Hang in the air like cigarette smoke, right?
Sometimes trying to live and let go
Like trying to talk with a mouth full of cinnamon though
I’m trying to crawl out the skin I'm in so
I can see through the eyes of a loved one, eyes of an enemy
Rising above sometimes takes a pedigree
That I fear that I don’t possess
And turns hope into hopelessness
But I won’t regress
Won’t let life wear me down
Staring down as the travelers all rush past
Some part their weary brow
And wear a frown like a handlebar moustache
So I live by forgive and forget
Rather that than to live with regret
It’s like living with debt
It’s a weight that’ll curve your spine
Living with hurt is like serving time

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
I pay homage to obstacles
Thin line between honour and horrible
The healing heart knows the eyes must overflow
Tears clear the windows that guard the soul
Now that the water flow, you can scrub the mud out of your land
The blood out of your hands
But you still gotta cleanse the heart that’s trying to beat inside
And it’s only purified by the tears you cry
You can fight all the devils and slay them
But if you’re made hard at the days end then they win
There’s only one force that can solve all this
I want the warm heart that we all start with
Sometimes we march out, ball our fists
I will give it all up for my softness
You will never invade my Holy place
I let the tears dry on my face

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pressure]
If these walls could talk they’d sing a sombre song
And if we’re stronger from this road that goes on and on
We wear scarring like armour made of problems from
Void of feeling, time ticking, sitting on a bomb
So disengaged, hope in us fades
Reaching out but the dark taking focus away
This road’s paved by the brave without knowing the way
Don’t stray bro, they didn’t build Rome in a day
And I don’t need to satisfy a ceaseless appetite
Just to feel at peace or gratified
If we don’t reach for the stars, only reach for satellite
We’ll live in faded colour, we dream in black and white
I know our demons walk among us
The struggle's something that we do, not something to become us
So let go of all the suffering and hurt
Yo, unless we ball it up and we burst

[Bridge]
So I can get through this, so I can get through this
So I can get through this, so I can get through this

[Hook][Intro]
Ah, the name of this song is Uncle Sam Goddamn
It's a show tune, but the show ain't been written for it yet
We're gonna see if Tony Jerome and the band can maybe work this shit out for me
And straighten me out right quick
I like it so far man
Yeah
Come on, lets go

Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief home of the slave
Grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred and proud

Lets do this shit for real, come on now

[Verse 1]
Smoke and mirrors, stripes and stars
Stolen for the cross in the name of God
Bloodshed, genocide, rape and fraud
Writ into the pages of the law good lord
The Cold Continent latch key child
Ran away one day and started acting foul
King of where the wild things are daddy's proud
Because the Roman Empire done passed it down
Imported and tortured a work force
And never healed the wounds or shook the curse off
Now the grown up Goliath nation
Holding open auditions for the part of David, can you feel it?
Nothing can save you; you question the reign
You get rushed in and chained up
Fist raised but I must be insane
Because I can't figure a single goddamn way to change it

[Hook x2]
Welcome to the United Snakes
Land of the thief, home of the slave
The grand imperial guard where the dollar is sacred, and power is God

[Verse 2]
All must bow to the fat and lazy
The fuck you, obey me, and why do they hate me? (Who me?)
Only two generations away
From the world's most despicable slavery trade
Pioneered so many ways to degrade a human being
That it can't be changed to this day
Legacy so ingrained in the way that we think;
We no longer need chains to be slaves
Lord it's a shameful display
The overseers even got raped along the way
Because the children can't escape from the pain
And they're born with poisonous hatred in their veins
Try and separate a man from his soul
You only strengthen him, and lose your own
But shoot that fucker if he walk near the throne
Remind him that this is my home, now I'm gone

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Hold up, give me one right here
Hold on
You don't give money to the bums
On a corner with a sign bleeding from their gums
Talking about you don't support a crackhead?
What you think happens to the money from your taxes?

[Verse 3]
Shit the Government's an addict
With a billion dollar a week kill brown people habit
And even if you ain't on the front line
When massah yell crunch time, you right back at it
Plain look at how you hustling backwards
At the end of the year, add up what they subtracted
Three outta twelve months your salary pays for that madness
Man, that's savage
What's left? get a big ass plasma
To see where they made Dan Rather point the damn camera
Only approved questions get answered
Now stand your ass up for that national anthem

[Hook] {x2}

[Instrumental break]

[Vocals: Mankwe Ndosi]
(You're so low)
Custom made (You're so low) *
To consume the noose (You're so low) *
Keep saying we're free (You're so low) *
But we're all just loose (You're so low) *Damn, man. I’m broker than an old VCR, man. I need a job
Are they hiring at your job?
I got a stack of red bills at my house. It looks like Valentine’s Day at the crib
My kids are eating left-over leftovers, man. I can’t fool them no more. It’s job time

[Hook]
Every day every day
Got to work every day
Every day every day
Got to work every day

[Verse 1]
My God there’s got to be more to life than this
There’s got to be a bigger reason that I exist
Work to eat to earn my keep
To ensure somewhere to sleep and spend the weekend buying shit

Don’t need economists to know I need pot to piss
Follow politics man I ain’t got time to think
What I got to set aside for my retirement
Cop a double shift pay somebody to watch the kids

Sick of all this but can’t take an off day
Doctor’s office I can’t swing the co pay
Trapped in a network, lucky just to get work
They celebrate every week nobody gets hurt

Greed could never leave well enough alone
They keep on squeezing till we bleed from every bone
And we’ll strive hard and stress about the rent
Probably still die poor and in debt without a cent but

[Hook]

I guess I’ll carry my ass down to the county and see what they’re talking about. But
You know they treat you like you shot somebody just because you need a little help

[Verse 2]
You’re telling me you ain’t never been down on your luck
Never tried to make them ends meet but just got stuck
Never slaved at a gig like a bum with a cup
Added all your pennies up and you still ain’t had enough

And the jobs full up they ain’t hiring
I’m barely surviving not enough to get by with
Hunger is a constant problem stomach steady growling
People getting shot in my environment

Study go to college is what them people hollering
Too many road blocks in the way its not an option
To say that its impossible I would be lying
But you ain’t got a chance if you’re not up in that top ten

A couple got a scholarship but I am not them
Ain’t got the skills to pay the bills so my pockets are thin
So until I cop a gig and my hardship ends
Fixing to line my self up at your welfare office again

And I expect to be accepted as the man that I am
Respectfully and appreciatively Ma’am
God damn you must be out of your mind

[Hook]

Do you see this Tea Party stuff, man? Them people look broke their damn self. Are they serious?

[Verse 3]
People stressing here’s the question
How they get people drinking tea in a recession?
It’s deception how absurd is this
How are so many poor people conservative?

A pro artist, I put it in the good music
A con artist job’s to make you look stupid
Lookie here I’ll teach you how to look through it
First thing you need to know every con got a hook to it

They seduce you with a little wealth
Say you could have some of these crumbs for yourself
If the government doesn’t make us help anyone else
You stuck a red sign on your foreclosed house

Make you think you’re taking back your nation
Then they turn it over to a major corporation
Those companies took the jobs overseas
And you handed them the wallet out your pocket for free

You’re staring in the sky with dollar signs for eyes
The blind right wing of a bird that can’t fly
Just a peacock with a poked out gut
Who’s too fat to fly so his ass just strut but

[Hook]

They’re so criminal minded we’ve been blinded
Looking for an honest job and can’t find it
They got a job bill we got a light bill
If we don’t pay ours our life is quite real

[Hook][Verse 1]
I don’t usually use those big words
Cause I don’t usually deal with big people
I find you can get a whole lot of small people
And whip hell out of a whole lot of big people

Murder murder murder kill kill kill
Cannibals walk the earth and get ill blood spill
Eyes sunk deep in their skull their bone chill
Few for survival most for the thrill

Terrorism is the war of the poor
Hold up a mirror so the script get flipped
Cause when it’s in reverse it ain’t wrong no more
Warfare’s the terrorism of the rich

Who’s the true guerilla
When the bomb on your body killing innocent civilians
But a life is a life and a killer is a killer
You’re at a desk chillin’ push a button kill a million

See the anguish of the parents
When they’re carrying the body of the baby that they cherish
When innocent people perish
It’s a very thin line between a soldier and a terrorist

[Hook]
Murder murder kill kill kill
Death and destruction a cap get pealed
Harm or heal destroy and rebuild
Shots still ring out and blood still spill

[Verse 2]
Overseas we can mutilate and mangle
Let me give you an example what our troops are coming back to
Cold cities where the youth are getting strangled
The community in peril and our future looking narrow

Your school already failed you

The boys in blue will nail you they salute you with a barrel
The streets are a certified dead zone
Decorated with chalk lines and headstones

All the way live and every night the bullets flying
Even if you ain’t dying you a traumatized survivor
When you grow up in a climate of overriding violence
You will never get beyond it it’ll always alive inside you

And death just surrounds you
Fallen classmates’ ghosts haunt you
Crime just calls you cause you look at what you walk through
Ain’t certain if you’ll make it ain’t sure you even want to

[Hook]

[Choir]
Tears and sorrow block the sunlight
Head low heart broke eyes closed tongue-tied
Waters raise the tide is climbing
Speeding time the sky is crying
Shots are fired bombs and sirens
War and riots mourning in America

[Verse 3]
Now that society forgot you
And they locked you in an obstacle course where nothing’s possible
If you slip up and they caught you
They got boxes where they lock you make a million dollars off you

They rule you too rude to school
They screw you in a booth shoot electricity through you
Or inject death into you
On a television set and let it ooze through you

Every time a leader tries to stand up for our freedom
Someone claps them with the heater their brain and back leaking
A shame their family grieving the only way to see them
Is a displaced dream displayed in a museum

They say they built our nation for a reason
Then they stained it with the bleeding of the slaves that never seen it
I ain’t hating I still want to believe it
And I’m not trying to leave it I just call it how I see it

[Hook]

They haven’t got anything to lose
And they’ve got everything to gain
And they’ll let you know in a minute
It takes two to tango. When I go, you go[Wale]
You gotta understand man
Personifying hip-hop
Try to

[Verse 1: Wale]
I rely on no man, but him that's speakin'. Him that lead him
Bleed on a track, like a pole vault freakish
Accident victim. Meanwhile beatin' up the beat via Benzi
Haters eyes gettin' wide like bench seats
I bring Maybach. You getter get me
Wale, yeah. All them haters get me
Osmosis, now niggas get me
I spit that halitosis. You got Listerine
I'm that extreme, So haters complain
So Blame It On my Rain. You all lip sync
Wale: I turn beef into mince meat
Your condescending ways don't convince me
And I didn't know what condescending meant till yesterday
So I threw it in a rap so I'd remember that
Yeah, it ain't nothin' to me
I play the background whole time Mario 3
Gone

[Hook: X8]
Second Time around

[Brother Ali]
Ha. It's Brother Ali. Hey Benzi my man. You gotta forgive me
I might go a little long. I got some shit I gotta get off my chest right now
Bring it back for me

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
I don't bite rapper's lines, I bite the captain's arm off
I don't throw shots in the air, I throw that Molotov
Cocktail, reservoir dog my collar off
Y'all scared to get that revolution popping off
You really got the guns you claim in the track
Then my question to you is who you aiming 'em at
You complain that the rap police caught you with a gat under the seat
Misdemeanored that twenty bag of weed
But little old me with the few facts that I speak
The homeland security gaffeled me over seas
Froze my bank account and seized my guarantee
And y'all are soundscanning like a hundred more than me
They kicking you off tour for freaking a chick or two
Verizon dissed me too cause I was too political
Y'all are all safe and shit, y'all are not saying shit
You just snap your fingers and dance and make your label rich
Gotta pay back that advance, so they ain't gave you shit
This is your chance to say something and you're wasting it
People are starving, you talking bout balling
Can't think of nothing more important than that jargon
Hundred different ways to describe diamonds sparkling
Eighty percent of kids are listening to y'all shit
I heard that statistic I almost cried
Never wanted so bad for 2pac to be alive
What the fuck happened to rap when
The gangsters are scared of upsetting they industry masters
It ain't my place to say and I hear all that
But fuck that, I live in the hood and we need y'all cats
So as soon as I hear y'al on some real pro black
Then I will gladly go back to my emo rap
They say the truth don't belong to nobody, if you see it you speak it
It would be a sin to keep it a secret
So if I need to breathe then believe that I mean it
Quit trying to be somebody's boss and be a leader
If it wasn't bad enough your labels are hoeing you
You can't even scan, your fans are downloading you
There's no connection, so they're not supporting you
You ain't never shed light on nothing that they're going through
We ain't buying CDs, we striving to live
And these artists don't need me they already rich
I ain't hating on you, rock them shines
Just remember us from time to time when you drop them lines
Rappers can't clap me
Jackers can't gat me
Original meaning of Jazzy Fat Nasty
Busy raising babies and living on tour
Signing off Brother Ali, sincerely yours[Verse]
Y'all see trends and pretend
I'm a veteran which means I'm pre-trend
Hand grown beats, sweetened, weakened, and watered down
I lead men, never follow clowns
Most time my soul speaks, then I jot it down
Therefore, most weekends I'm out of town
First class seat, feet seldom on the ground
'Less I'm in the V, she got her pedal to the ground
I do not friend and de-friend, I'm all around
Keep them 'till the end, go every round
Now, got a couple dead homies but no ex-homies
Once I give my word by that I'm bound
Racks on racks is in my hands, my cash is in advance
I don't just put it all in my raps, it's in my pants or
Tucked under the mattress or in the bank
I ain't telling y'all exactly, I'm more savvy than you think
I walked around with gats and carried a little shank
Cause the world treat me bad and I couldn't afford a shrink
Shit was rough, I scribbled it in my books
They say you must be independent cause your image sucks
They say necessity's a bitch
Or the mother of all inventions, you take your pick
Either way I ain't afraid to take a risk
So that's the one I made my babies with
They saying light skin is in style, dark skin is in style
How come white folks always in style though? Huh
You can check the file but you know what's never in style?
Fat Muslim rapping albinos, uh, yeah I know
I only love her if she in the struggle
I can't relate to a woman who's never been through nothing
High, saddity, privileged and soft
They pretty but they always say something to piss me off
My heart's forever with the underdog
Who got nothing to give except for love accord
You should listen to this when you're occupying
? frontlining
Even if you don't join us in the Ramadan
Starving the one thing we all got in common
That's why I'm not styling on 'em
Righteous dude in a Maybach I'm Stalley on 'em
More like a four-door Honda on 'em
Put my baby mama through college on 'em
Off a type of rhyming they find inspiring
I'm not a boss on a yacht, I'm Basquiat
Before I finish the rhyme, you start rewinding
Cause everything that drops out my mind's a diamond
I'm only rocking the bling that's in my chin
Diamonds and gin, to shining from within
That's some shit the poor people say
Maybe so but it's true for me either way
You can ask your man Hov if I'm blinging
He gotta admit it (Uh, it's just different)
The best verse on a song I ain't even on
It's either now, 4th king, never steer you wrong
Reporting live, A-L-I, your brother
Mourning in America, dreaming in colorSo I never told the world that the first time I toured
I came home to find that little man had been ignored
Two years old got a hold of water you had boiled
And burned his little head and his face while you snored

You were afraid of bringing him to the hospital
‘Cause two weeks ago your mom called the cops on you
Child protection paid a visit
Ruled that the crib was unfit to raise kids in

I’m working ten hour days at the gig then
You were unemployed all null and void
Now I ain’t trying to be no Sigmund Freud
But ain’t you supposed to have instincts when it comes to the boy

I called a cab and took him to county hospital
They shaved hair and burnt flesh off his skull
Held him overnight to fight infection
I slept sitting up in a chair directly next to him

I just knew you would join us but instead
Hopped your ass on the bus went home and went to bed
That’s the very moment I divorced you in my head
God might forgive you for that I never did

All you need right now

Faheem we can see the throne from here
I may never sit there but brother you’re the heir
Pull up a chair let pop bend your ear
Here baby dry those tears

I know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do
Well it’s not because she doesn’t love you
It’s because she grew up in something they call foster care
That’s when strangers raise you your mom’s not there

Imagine how she felt when she was your age
Going from place to place never feeling safe
Never having love never having faith
She probably thought the world was a big scary place

Where was her mommy at well that’s kind of sad
She used drugs to forget the problems she had
There was a new one back then they called crack
Once you try it there was almost no coming back

She couldn’t be the mommy she wanted to be
She was chasing a high all in the street
Won’t tell you no lie real is all I can be
I believe only truth can set you free

There’s a whole lot of pain in your bloodline
But there’s a whole lot of strength in the sunshine
Lean back let the new day greet you
‘Cause you’re standing on the shoulders of a people

Who been beat down and treated unequal
But the prayer that they made now has reached you
It’s plain to see it’s true
Beautiful prince I wish they could see you

All you need right now[Hook]
It's an American Nightmare
We don't fight fair
We take lives here
Done gone

[Verse One: Brother Ali]
Untouchable
Rain, sun or cool
Breeze, ease, the pain crack another brew
Ghetto public school, leak rain from the roof
Troubled youth, was your name?
Straight from the womb
Cycle coming true
Your father flew through the same trap door that you'll one day plummet through
Ain't nothing new
Rugged like a hundred proof
Place where they say the easy way is jumping from the roof
Police coming through
They rough
Hand cuff, G
Grab knucks, points guns at you no matter what you do
How the quote unquote justice move
If you protect us then who protect us from you?
There's a couple youth
Workers but they're few
Far between, they can't reach but one or two
You only bustin' loose
When you got numbers glued to your back
Whether that's a jersey or a jump suit
You wonder what you do to make the world punish you
That's when your sense of right and wrong start to come aloof
Hustlers recruit
Right in front of school
Fuck the rules
You got ? , you got nothing to loose
They show it on the news
Them people judging you
As if you had a fuckin' chance this is what you choose
Can't sing nothing but the blues
Americas Nightmare the God's honest truth

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse Two: Scarface]
I'm barely grown
I'm lost all alone
Out on my own
My mind gone
Pocket with stones
And I pitch to these unknowns
Cops tend to roll undercover trying to bust us
But cops get they head flown
I'm in a dead zone
I ain't supposed to be here
I'm a ghost with a pistol blowin' smoke totin' weed here
See here?
The fine print you ain't read there
The I-don't-give-a-fuck-part
Approach you where you sleep at
Black
Your whole world seems to fade to it
And I'm a passer-by acting like I ain't do it
It's plain stupid
The drugs must have done that
As you bleed I get the dry heave
Nauseous because I can't vomit
Something
Wicked this way cometh
The ending of days
God promise
That's brung us
To the point where we at now
And I have come to far for me to back down
These devilish ways
These voices I hear from the grave
Speak to me saying "Kill that motherfucker", I'm a slave to it

[Hook][Verse 1: YONAS]
I’ve been searching for a reason to live
And I don’t wanna take, I want a reason to give
There’s something deep inside of me that eats at my ribs
I wonder if I'll live to see me and my kids
‘cause the world’s in trouble, and it’s about to get a little worse
It all started when I jotted down my little verse
And that evolved into notebooks and notebooks of me
Trying to relate to the people that will feel my hurt
When I look into my soul I see the eyes of y’all
When you look into my soul, you see the eyes of God
So join me on this problem as I try to solve
And grow with me as you witness all I evolve
I’m living under the sun, and even when I’m rich I’ll be at one with the slums
The greatest never rush, they just run with the drums
And live their life to the fullest, man, it’s done when it’s done

[Hook]
People shouldn’t speak of what they don’t know
‘cause everyone’s got something they don’t show
And I’ll be searching for a reason
A reason to live, a reason to breathe
‘cause people shouldn’t speak of what they don’t know
‘cause everyone’s got something they don’t show
And I’ll be searching for a reason
A reason to live, a reason to breathe

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
Playing on the wet ground, wrapped up in a death shroud
It’s gone, broken, I’m scared to let the breath out
Nasty pieces unsung, what is it I run from?
I check home to change clothes and bury loved ones
Text message saying “please call home”
Scared to pick up the phone, I’m afraid someone else is gone
I travel around the globe, they treat me like I’m holy
Not knowing I can’t save the folks closest to me
I cheat ‘em, I fent ‘em, I leave ‘em , I disappoint
I should be there for them, the road turns cold
Suicide runs through the new man side of my family
Pops master’s right, I knew it was not an accident
Young widow, two little guys he left behind
Same ages as mine, he was married four times
My parents in the ground, I’m the leader of my family
They’re all looking at me, but I don’t have the answers
I’m just knowing that I'm supposed to gain some understanding
Hollering to God to try to figure what the plan is
Long as I’m breathing like these, ‘til I cease and desist
Me and my kids got a reason to live

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YONAS]
I’m just looking for a reason to wake
‘cause every morning someone’s got a reason to flake
I’m driving off this cliff at a hundred miles an hour
And my only fear is I don’t have a reason to brake
I’m getting lonely, Lord. This world is phoney Lord
And fuck a sony lord, i want my own accord
These niggers talking bout their bentleys
While they’re quoting Forbes
Almost like they forgot about niggers that still owning Fords
I keep a shooting to death, I can never be shallow, I’m perusing the depth
I’m using my music to improve on what's left
It’s sort of like I’m moving mountains when I’m moving a cliff
I sing to find peace in the notes
Who knew the world would find a bit of peace with my quotes?
I've seen success before, it's like I’m meeting a ghost
But what’s confusing is I guess I never seen it this close

[Hook][Verse 1]
There's big pieces of a life she can't remember
Her mind shuts down, it's trying to protect her
Might be for the best to forget but it seems like
They always reappear when she least expects
Late nights we lay awake, drowning in the lake that pours out of her face
Years late but she's still not safe
Memories leap out ant time, any place
The way he smelled,the way he smiled
The evil she even recognized as a child
Hand on her throat, sting of a fist
Instead of her first kiss she got this
Shameful feeling, painful secret
Lonely knowin' that nobody would believe it
Every wound that escapes her time capsule
Hurts like the day it was born and it's brand new

[Refrain]
I wasn't there babygirl but I'm here
I don't know what to say I just hear
If there's one wish I could make true
I would shoulder that pain and take it off you
Don't run babygirl, don't run
You gotta' face what you fighting, head on
Only one thing I could say in truth
You gotta' deal with the demons before they deal with you

[Verse 2]
How can she find peace in her mind when
Love means returning to the scene of a crime?
I can feel it inside we've reopened wounds every time we intertwine
Such an evil design when you can't even enjoy the sweetness you find
Trying to see through the tears in your eyes and rebuild your shrine one piece at a time
E & K made it all fade away
Colors don't burn no more it's all gray
Can't find heaven from within that shell, but it's enough of a blessing if just not seen hell
Constant inner dialog says just end this roller coaster ride you're on
Only one solution seems final: slide into a hole where your pain can't find you

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
She said if I was meant to die he would've killed me
There must be a reason that I still breathe
I don't have the tools to rebuild me
But I still believe that one day I could feel free
And my body can be mine again
My eyes can learn how to shine again
My inner child won't have to hide and then
When I'm strong then love could be invited in
Sweet God that's all I ask, of thee
I'm willing to give what you demand of me
I'm learning to embrace the reality
That life doesn't always turn out how it's planned to be
I didn't deserve what was handed me
Only one who can grant happiness is me
What it takes for her to face the day
I can only hope to be half that brave

[Refrain][Verse 1]
Show promoter backstage pacin (Why is that?)
He's tryin to take control of his situation
He know damn well he ain't got the money I expect to have
So I'm stuffin all the backstage in my record bag
But that's what you get when you don't pay shit
Cause I can't pay my rent on free water and chips
And if free beer means payment is what you think
BK drank one and Ali don't drink
So produce the fetti, cheddar or whatever you call it
Go get your dough split and come the hell up off it
This is how I feed my family, so I'm not gonna forfeit
And if that doesn't get it, I'm gonna go for your wallet
Let me guess - the turnout wasn't quite what you expected
Let me guess - somethin that the club owner did wrecked it
Let me guess - it's hard to pack em in in this kind of weather
And nobody wanna come and party after 9/11
That's not a MP, that's a YP - your problem
You need to have this shit planned out before callin
This is not a game to me, dog, you stealin from my family
You just gon' have to understand me
Backstage pacin

[Verse 2]
Opening act backstage pacin (Why is that?)
They tryin take control of they situation
But they mad salty cause they wore they fuckin matchin shirts
And the crowd didn't feel them and they went on first
It's the monitor, the soundman, it's the muthafuckin mics
Cats in this state are haters and the whole crowd's white
Don't sleep, your Wu-Tang impression is tight
And if blah-blah would have happened, y'all'd had em snappin
Let me guess - you and your girl had a conversation
Let me guess - she doesn't feel that you're being compensated
Let me guess - you've been rappin for a year and a half
And you mad brave when you get a little beer in your ass
At this stage y'all really need to show and prove
Pay attention, pay respect, pay homage, pay your dues
Be happy with your 20 minutes and your drink tickets
And go build your own scene if you think different
Hah, cause we ain't even triyn to take y'all shit
The Micronauts should have pinky rings to make y'all kiss
It's a road now, but who you think paved all this?
You're mad-face makin, you're lucky to be backstage pacin

[Bridge]
Fee-fi-fo-fum
Watch out, muthafucka, hear the big Brother come
Like fee-fi-fo-fum
(Here it come, here it come, here it kiddy-come-come)

[Verse 3]
Brother Ali backstage pacin (Why is that?)
He tryin to take control of his situation
He's a million miles from home and his dick is on hard
And these girls are gonna make him prove that he believe in God
I'm haunted by an overfriendly poetry chick
Who keeps showin me hip cause she know that she thick
And if I met her on the street I probably wouldn't look twice
But at a show with my ego on swoll she look like
A master at applyin Maybelline with thighs you'd love to lay between
Hair was fly with raving sheen, gigantic eyes in hazel green
Revealin just enough to let me know she got it
But concealin just enough to let imagination frolic
Let me guess - my poetry makes you feel so inspired
Let me guess - the way I play off the vibe makes you excited
Let me guess - you wanna go and party after the show
And you were hopin that the two of us could capture the flow
She like, "Come on Ali, it ain't nothin to dance"
By the end of the song, girl, I be rubbin your ass
And by the end of the night I might be fuckin you fast
Then my wife probably find a new husband and dashI circle my opponents like a bird of prey, in search of a vertebrae
Just to curse your day, and make blue sky revert to gray
Trying to work my way back to where the purpose gave birth
To the perfect way to quench my thirst to slay rappers
Penetrate your fragile brain matter
Stand glaring at you with command, and frame, and stature
Actually mastered the talent it takes to seize the breath
Out of your chest and leave em shaking
These heads never impressed us, I credit the best cause I
?Mix every breath? with respect for my predecessors
To die the best of deaths is meaning gunfire
Blessed with faith alone, testing the oppressive
This dimension inside your pain is my domain
By signing my name I solidify the rain
In an instant I will drain em, get em out the game
Insisted upon bickering with death until the quiet came
In silence remained, touched him with his lights out and
I'm in his veins, ushering his life out him
He cried when it came, the moment he froze
And death pulled his soul through the hole in his nose

From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight

Let 'em watch the Brother rip, they need to fucking study it
Hella the missin pieces like they tryin' to make the puzzle fit
It's some other shit, nothing like when we discovered it
Fools rapping like they tried to suck a dick and bust they lip
Half assing and ain't mastered to crowd for shit
They pacifists and there ain't nothing bout them passionate
Never had a pay a bill, or spent a day in jail
And hold mic's like they're scared as hell to break a nail
Keep your behind inside your seat, eyes upon your feet
Need to keep riding the dick instead of tryin' to ride the beat
I come from a time when rhyming was true self defining
Ain't no time for whining, protecting your little hymen
If your crew's really the shit, prove it in your set
You really should get off the stage, you're too pretty to sweat
If he's not in alliance, beat him in to compliance
Something to do while I'm feeding him to the lions
Keep being defiant, ain't nothing I can say to you
Except you better stay out my range of view, a day or two
Your friendly neighborhood Rhymesayer, I'll lay a
Asswhoopin on ya, that's one of a kind, playa

From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight

You live in a world of artificial turf, plastic sky
Got the nerve to stay up nights and ask it why
?Ho's? fucking your shit up, you're forced to pucker your lips up
That gets flipped up, you can kiss your own ass goodbye
You don't understand me, I don't have Plan B
I don't have a Mom and Dad to help me land on my feet
I don't have the luxury of living where the grass is green
Ink pen victims and ten of their friends with them
Ive been kicking, scratching scraping for respect
Since knee-high, believe I will take it to your neck
I release my, venomous sentiments at the drop of a hat
You motherfuckers got a problem with that?
I step through all possible traps
Once you walk with your balls fully exposed it's hard to look back
And I gotta react, not for nothing, just to cuss you
There ain't nothing subtle 'bout an old fashioned "Fuck You"

From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight
From the moment I sight 'em, decide I don't like 'em
I evacuate the little bit of life they got inside 'em
Somebody gon' get dead tonight
Bad mother fucker gotta split heads tonight[Intro: MURS]
That was, that was the end
And it squashed the whole beef

[Verse 1: Brother Ali]
I'm so incredibly nasty
Yes my Mama slapped me when she had me
Told me get your ass out with your Daddy
Talked hella trash and my teachers couldn't stand me
Used to call me bastard and told me I was trashy
Unsupervised child, they call me a Latchkey
At-risk youth from a single parent family
Nuts got hairy and my voice got raspy
Crews were getting acne, I was getting savvy
Yes I'm a bad motherfucker, understand me
Grew up beaten, broken glass, rapping in the alley
Got my hands dirty, I was hiding in a trash heap
Hopping out, knocking out cats, grabbing they ten speed
Little boys and the girls, they both pack heat
Both had something I need from em in they pants see
Broads got the booty all felt up in the back seat
Dudes got they lunch money boosted and they ass beat
Can I get it back, fuck naw, don't even ask me
When you see the Preacher
Keep your peace and don't you dare speak
None of y'all snitches ain't in the same class as me
We ain't the same cause you wrote a couple raps G
That cover charge that you payin is my salary
Merchandise you carry away is all tax free
Facing all my bills and I count my money carefully
Bet your fucking ass ain't nobody ever jack me, see

[Hook x2: Brother Ali]
You's a bad motherfucker man
On the other hand, you never see a sucker stand close to where the Brother stand
You God damn right about that
Got me so pissed off, I wanna fight em out back

[Verse 2: Brother Ali]
My nuts done swung all around the planet
Where the fuck y'all from
I already captured it, I bust my gun
Had a little cannon kid
Caught a little accident, slid em in the ambulance
He asked for this rumble, his ass got trouble
I'm picking glass out of my knuckles like that's comfortable
Where you running to, you ever wanna a true
Bad motherfucker, you accept no substitute
No understudy dudes and no number
Two
Trust when it come to busting loose, I'm the ugly truth
You ever want the proof, you can check the documents
Or you just watch the kid break door with my fist
I'm on some shit
Your old lady grabbing on the kid like she chose me
Police captain, ain't attempting to hold me
A O.G. mack with a .38 told me

[Hook][Brother Ali]
Brothers and sisters I know we had a good time this evening
If we can get your attention, at the stage for just a minute, please
Want thank y'all ever so kindly for coming out and joining us yet again
You know me and Anthony sure do appreciate it
We want to thank, his majesty, I Self Divine, for, blessing us
With his presence here this evening
Yeah, you know my big brother Slug, he got on the mic tonight but
If you listen real close he's there in everything we ever did
In the background smoking, you know, being cool
Ant break this down for me
Just going give you a few more words before we, before we get on outta here
(*clears throat*)

When I was young you couldn't tear me away from the stereo
And used to carry one with me everywhere I go
As I memorized the words I genuinely believed every line I heard
I thought that these men that I referred to
Was prophets of our time would never lie in verse
I can't begin to tell you how it hurt
As time went on some of them disguises burst
I always said if ever I get heard, if ever I am perched in an elevated place
High enough so this world can recognize my words
I would never turn and try to hide my face
And so I give it all as an author
Even if myself is all I have to offer
I don't exaggerate it, I would gladly be hated for what I am
And just stand and state it
And if you relate then you can take it
All human beings are the same when we're naked
We all living through the same insane trip
But we ain't it in alone if somebody stand up and say..

[Brother Ali]
A lot of people waiting for their big break to make it
You going spend your all life waiting until you learn that
Anything given to a man can be taken
Only thing that's ever really yours is what you earn
It's a mistake to label it patience when you see a person
Latently waiting for a turn
Another one got the faith to go and take his
Win, lose, or draw the end ain't the concern
I want it so bad I can taste it
And makeshift tools are the only ones to work
In the hands of a dreamer to make it take shape with
See if I can't get this old torch to burn
And all of those chains and the bracelets are symbols of that
For which our souls yearn
Strip it all away and what you face is we're trying to touch happy
Before we touch the earn
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
Every show you ever saw, every album that you bought
You can be my guest and tear it all apart
At the foundation you'll be sitting there with what I fought
The past is gone, my path is charted
My grasp is strong, I'm just getting started
My aim is steady and my view is clear
My name became heavy and the truth is here...[Brother Ali Intro]
Freeway got a voice like an electric guitar, I'm the bass to it
Walk to the speaker hold your face to it
Freezer

[Freeway]
I'm 'bout to rip it straight from the rip
Body every beat the scriptures to me that we close to the end
Listen, Kill 'em with the spit and put my boys in position
So none of my niggas got to pitch on the street
It's Young Freezer the bar spitter the big beard
From the city of brotherly hate where we bear eagles
The desert kind and we pay them coppers no never mind
Niggas still palm heaters
My hood is bad they turn teen they grab ninas
A couple aunts one mother no dad
Streets was their father figure and they never had
That's why they run up in your spot with a couple Glocks
Had hunger pains I couldn't make it to eat
Got introduced to Islam started making Salat
We in two different cities
Minnnesota and Philly
But I'm on the same page as Brother Ali

[Brother Ali talking]
Yeah Joell Ortiz, get it

[Joell Ortiz]
I Ain't make believe like some of these costume fuckers
So YAOWAH, I literally got you Brother
Ain't a hood too rough ain't a block too gutter
These rappers starting to look like them pork chops you smother
Slide me a fork damn right I eat pork
I'm sick I dine on the swine flu with every thought
Every track I rhyme to develops a heavy cough
Till it's fully blown and it turns into a smelly corpse
I'm eatin' I ain't fat this just how my belly floss
I'm on the road so much I'm build me a telly porch
Bitches be hawkin', I be turnin' my celly off
They crazy like the ass on Miss Tracee Ellis Ross
Come home early I might be in that bed of yours
Girls like me I'm sort of like a walking metaphor
And this mic seems like it kinda just might be...a gift and a curse
They give me ass and curse me out when I don't make 'em wifey
I'm on the set mic check like your favorite Nikes
A Rhyme Sayer so it's only right that they invite me
On the track with 'em. I'm oozing that rap rhythm
Could rhyme forever whatever. I'll let Ali scrap with 'em

[Brother Ali]
Some of the greatest got respect for the way that I rock the set
But you ain't seen no Jacob shit dangling off my neck
So of course, dudes around the way are all suspect
Why them Rhymesayers boys ain't break you off with a check
Wait a minute it's not that I ain't get it
It's just that I'm considerate
And shit about they way I spend it
You ain't never heard me say I'm pimpin'
I referee the game I'm in and so I play it different
I Need the deed to my home and the title to my car
Make sure that my health and my life are all insured
If I ain't got all four I consider myself poor
Diamonds to the floor is something I can not afford
You see these cats and most of them are lying
Selling CDs and packs, both of them are dying
My man Free earned that shit it ain't a costume
And I ain't 'bout to cop a fake joint to give props to 'em
You ain't seen nothing crazy on my arm (Ha Ha Hum)
My kids got a stay at home mom
Until my grand kids are straight I ain't buying jewelry
And truly can't thank my fans enough for what they do for me
Industry suits wasn't digging my jams
I tour like a madman build my brand
Soundscan never meant nothing to the fans
They ain't in it for the trends they want to listen to the man
I give 'em what I can and when I'm in the jam
I get to spittin' so ridiculous they pissing in their pants
They listen every chance that they can get it their hands
Until they wear the CD out and go and get that shit again

God damn it got me back on my rap shit
Got that home run king batting average
Achievements, no 'roids taken, no astrict, don't need it
No styles bitten, no ass kissed
Believe it
Record is flawless my respect is enormous
My current peer group is a short list
Only way I lose if I forfeit
The only way you climb in these shoes is if I tire of the throne and climb off it
Dont' hold your breath on it
Only begun
If you ain't the Rhymesayers I don't owe you a crumb
Can't no MC call me his son
The lowest ever been uttered is kid brother but that's only been one
I paved my own road to the sun
My aura glow has become
A beacon of hope the closer I come
I'm sorry there can only be one
Champ around here I am not a peer
I'm up here, you down there
Look down and the ground's near
Au contraire I hear your heart pound fear loud and clear
Feet of sasquatch
MC's are mad soft
Make their weak ass glass jaw meet the asphalt
Better hope Ali don't blast off
He'll twist your hand off
Take you in the back and saw the cast off
Can't slow him up the more he get the more he want
They steady telling me hip hop is in some sort of rut
That's cause they watching the TV and they ignoring us
It ain't my fault they fail to see that we done tore it up
I'm from a broken mold y'all are from that carbon cut
That shit has all been done before
I'm here to call your bluff
I don't compare myself to dead rappers
I'm here to write the next chapter in braille and left handed
Consider yourself reprimanded
Fresh rap shit and y'all know we the best at itYo Ant, kick the beat you just kicked a little while ago...

[Verse 1]
I bitchslap rappers so hard it give em whiplash
You fuckin with sleeveless t-shirts, where your tricks at?
Look left, look right, wait, where your chick at?
She findin out she walk and talk white but ride dick black
I'm a big baller, shot caller, all a y'all are runnin laps
Let me tell you little fuckers a story walkin out
You probably think you're somebody big talkin loud
You're transparent, I been starin through your Karl Kani
Art imitates life imitates art
Get it straight, slice through the mic, pourin out my heart
When it's late night we litter the landscape
Animate our dead opposition to get one last phoney handshake
I read a lot and write a lot, empty my pockets at the giro shop
Hit the cash machine for some green, maybe a ten spot
I said giro cause my Greek's a little broken
But my four-letter French works fine if you're provokin

[Hook]
And we killers in the morning, killers in the evening
Wake up and we yawnin, happy we still breathin
Got one longin, that's to keep eatin
We here to stay and we ain't leavin
(Rock y'all)
(Everything gonna be alright)

[Verse 2]
I'm a cross between John Gotti and Mahatma Gandhi
Look between pimp and square, you probably find me
There, in vain I solemnly swear
I'm a Guardian Angel with gang signs in the air
I spent too much time fuckin with sorry sobs
Treatin beats like bitches, flippin ménage à trois's
You ain't tryin to see us angry, pop, we already hard
Fuckin with the diplomats'll get you horribly scarred
From the cat behind the wall who play handball in the yard
To the one that run the block as head baller in charge
To the brothers with the kufis on that walk with their God
Mission Hill, Caprini Green, all ghetto scenery
Every city got us beaten up, down-trodden, creepin up
Soundbombing people, what? Till we get a equal cut
We come through straight smashin on the haters
Witness the world, the Rhymesayers

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Often the brain runs
And expresses itself in words, sometimes profane ones
That's when it first occurred to me where the pain comes
From, page one in my rhyme book
If you listen closely you can picture how my line looks
You presently pressed to be restin next to me
The best of me molestin destiny wrestlin with ecstacy
The recipe for immoratlity
Flows actually be on the malls and factories
Of urban life with the laws of gravity
Audacity, you got a lot of it
Common sense should tell you not to rap against
My obvious dominance
My real life size is bigger than your confidence
Man, fuck ya'll

[ Hook ]Get yourself together now because it's hit time

Your known as the hit makers
Breaker breakers, party makers
They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver
For all you cats, who never put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
If you don't dig that you gotta hold your soul
If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
Because singing might be loud and clear

[Brother Ali]
Ayo, the music made 'em jump back
Fuck that, how y'all gonna contrast somethin fat, without lettin Ali touch that
Nothin' whack leaves his lips, you’re not serious
I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is)
A seasoned veteran, an ego reckon
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Y'all ain't fuckin with the ox so put your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons
So no

[Slug]
Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage
Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it, the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Slug, even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
(Fuck that, sucka jump back)
I hold the game like Notre Dame, I know your dame
(We cut a hunch back), Ali run that

[Brother Ali]
From cats lips to gods ears
We mind yall punk bastards and cross hairs
Applying our thug tactics till y'all scared
Don't stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs (ohh yeah)

[Slug]
Fuck that, jump back, yo, what's that
Drippin off her nuts, wait, why she got a nut sack?
You fuckin rappers are she-males
From the retail to the e-mail, your freak fell cause you need help

Chorus (2x)
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same ol' shit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

[Brother Ali] (Slug)
(Rappers steppin to)
Ah yeah they get their shits burned
I throw a roll of quarters and cyphers and then I get learned
(Yo I don't care were you represent son, where's your chicks?)
We'll take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run

[Slug]
Listen, I know your mission, some type of magician that likes to go fishin
On the mic with air tight precision, the leaders keeping tradition
When you ain't even keeping the rhythm the DJ is spinnin
Calm down little camper, I've got the answers
You should fuck exotic dancers
You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers
It doesn't matter turn it up, what the fuck you think that amps for?

[Brother Ali]
I write poems, write rhymes, write my name in the snow
And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your ho
And I should but instead I'll just pay the waiter and go
But if I didn't have a wife, yo your kids'll be albinos
Your respect is like a stick in the grass
Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on without it
I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass
With your tongue out and write a love song about it

[Slug]
Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles
The love comes in vomit, the money comes in dribbles
The Minnesota missiles, self taught
Communication, mutilation, holding pictures of your sister naked

[Brother Ali]
Ha ha, You to drunk to walk down the stairs
And know you standing here choking on my pubic hairs
Telling me your name is if you think the brother cares
If you keep bumping your guns we can fucking take it there

[Slug] (Brother Ali)
I make a room full of punk rocks stop and do wop
(Rest those shots from a cop, and ask him who's your pops)
Who's you daddy, Fuck that, Jump back and act happy
(Sing my fucking chorus before I punch you in your face)

[Hook] - 2X[Intro]

(sample)
Get yourself together now because it's hit time
Your known as the hit makers
Breaker breakers, party makers
They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver
For all you cats, we're gonna put more dips in your hips
More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride
If you don't dig that you gotta hole in your soul
If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address
Because singing might be loud and clear

[Brother Ali]
Ayo, the music made 'em jump back
Fuck that, how y'all gonna come tracks, some fat, without lettin Ali touch that?
Nothin' whack leave his lips
You're not serious, I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is)
A seasoned veteran, an ego reckon
I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin
Y'all ain't fuckin with the ox so put your feeble session
Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons
Sluggo

[Slug]
Here we go
Lookin at me like they know me
Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me
Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage
Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast
So taste it, the vitamins are subtle
So tighten up to Sluggo, even try to decipher the puzzle
But shut up though
(Fuck that, sucka jump back)
I hold the game like Notre Dame, I know your dame
(We call her hunch back), Ali run that

[Brother Ali]
From cats lips to gods ears
We mind yall punk bastards and cross hairs
Applying our thug tactics till y'all scared
Don't stop till your drunk ass hits the back stairs (ohh yeah)

[Slug]
Fuck that, jump back, yo, what's that
Drippin off her nuts, wait, why she got a nut sack?
You fuckin rappers are she-males
From the retail to the e-mail, the feet felt cause you need help

[Hook] x 2
Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow
If we open for y'all it's still our show
I hear the same bullshit wherever I go
Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah

[Brother Ali] (Slug)
(Rappers steppin to)
Ah yeah they get their shits burned
I throw a roll of quarters and cyphers and then I get learned
(Yo I don't care were you represent son, where's your chicks?)
We'll take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run

[Slug]
Listen, I know your mission, some type of magician that likes to go fishin

You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers

[Hook] x 2[Intro - Brother Ali]
(Hmmmmmmm)
Ha, ha, ha
Hey, hey, heeey
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, heeey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

[Verse 1 - Brother Ali]
Old master had a leper for a child
Left him out to fend for his self in the wild
They laughed at him anytime he went to town
So he kept to his self and he seldom came around
Loved life and he loved his kin
But he couldn't understand why they ain't love him
Slept out in the shed all alone
And all he ever wanted was some friends of his own
A few hands saved him, took him in and raised him
Taught him about love and struggle and patience
Gave him the family comfort he was cravin
He worked when they work and he sang when they sang
He sang so clear and so loud
That the masters of the children could hear him from the house
They recognize his voice and ran out
Everybody wanna know what the ruckus all about y'all

[Hook 1 - Brother Ali] - 2X
Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, bring us a brand new day

[Break - Brother Ali]
Ha, ha (another day), ha
Hey, hey, heeey, ah (Lord I just gotta find a way)

[Verse 2 - Brother Ali]
See good Lord, I've been waitin so long
For y'all to come out here and take me in the home
The world's so cold with no place to belong
They said "come on in boy, sing your song"
He stepped inside and to his surprise
It was so damn fly, he can't believe his eyes
Ate and he drank and he felt satisfied
'Til he sat by the window and he glanced out-side
Loved ones out workin
Eyes got full and his heart start hurtin
Cause them folk been singin for years
But ain't any one of them set foot up in here
Hold up, how you get so much
Livin off folk like us that got it so rough
The way you hold 'em in your cold clutch
Makes me think that you don't love your own soul enough

[Hook 2 - Brother Ali]
Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, bring us a brand new day

Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say
Everybody wanna hear what you have to say
Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way
Them songs of yours, give us a brand new day

[Break]

[Verse 3 - Brother Ali]
Closed his eyes as he sang every note
The songs he was taught and the ones that he wrote
Stood up, cleared his throat, grabbed his coat
In those last moments, a few words were spoke
"I used to peek at this old house in awe
Imaginin what it must be like and all
And this the finest spread these eyes ever saw
But I don't mind sayin I feel sorry for y'all
All that gettin, so little givin
Led a lot of y'all to forget what's missin
Built you a big pretty prison to sit in
Strut around here, convinced that that's livin
But we gonna keep on singin
Keep on solderin, keep on buildin
Keep on teachin and keep on listenin
And keep, keepin on, 'til the whole thing's different"
In the shed, the sun start to set
Said all his prayers and laid down his head
Everything said that he needed to say
And one of these mornings we'll wake up to a brand new

[Hook 2]

[Break][Refrain - female Voice]
Searching for a better world
This ain't no game (this is not a game)
Searching for a better world
This ain't no game (this is not a game)

[Verse 1 - Zumbi]
Yeah, this is for my caged birds
Who's fighting just like me
Daily and nightly, so beyond getting icy
It's likely we'll never get out here
But we don't care, keep my mind up there
High above all the noise and pollution, the shootin'
The robbin' and lootin' and the mind prostitution
Got a problem sucker that y'all can't solve
Looking deep into my mirror, let the thoughts revolve
Like we're an orbit on the dark side of the moon
I can't ignore it the second coming probably soon
Everyday, as I lay, getting tuned with the boom the pain relief is too coon, check this out of my room
But my mind go free so the galaxy blooms
Like my momma told me pray to the greatest of jews
Picture me, rolling out, I'm holding, take control of the script
Off my back spread my wings, my spirit can live (live live live..)

[Refrain - female Voice]
Searching for a better world
This ain't no game (this is not a game)
Searching for a better world
This ain't no game (this is not a game)

[Verse 2 - Brother Ali]
Ah, a voice rang in the emptiness
The helplesss moan of wings that were never spread
My song brings the evidence
Allowing me to sing what was never said
Parrots look down on the pidgeons who
Comb the streets for old trash to eat
But my head's up I strut through this bitch cause
My beak doesn't repeat my masters speech
My feathers are your scholars ink pen
They held their natives decorate their big men
I represent strength and wisdom and even you can see freedom ring when my wings spread
What is it about you that you have to capture
That what you can not master
If you can't grasp it you attack it, trap it, slam it in a cage and latch it
Everyday that you hold me in bars is another day I can't teach your soul to soar
Here both of us are, link to this song - and when you hear a caged bird, sing along!

[Refrain - female Voice]
Searching for a better world
This ain't no game (this is not a game)
Searching for a better world
This ain't no game (this is not a game)[Intro]
I can't scratch, cause I'm drunk
I got bad teeth and my gums are bleeding
Come and fucking get me, motherfucker
Yeah, break, start the song now, fucker

[Verse 1]
[Slug]
We traveling the missle, weaving through your cornfields
Leaving behind a trail of amateur porn and orange peels
Navagatin' through this basement, that masquerades
As a nation, practising my acetate masturbation
Watching the expressions on the faces
Of them ones designated to be the queens, kings, and aces
How many miles can you put on one sole
Before the smile starts to blend into one big bullet hole

[Brother Ali]
Shoot through it as a unit, with the best of my crew
Bumping melodies and memories too, my head's killing me, ooh
Stomach empty, my bladder is full
Two-year-old son on Jaybird's phone cryin', you missing me
And I'm starving, I'll bite your arm off
Sabertooth Tiger, run the night with the sharp claws
In your backyard just to fuck with your guard dog
Throw a brick through your shit and cut the alarm off
Bitch

[Slug]
Fuck yes, I do my best to take advantage in bouts
With one hand over the mouth, still managin' to shout
There's more said within the lines on your forehead
Than they could ever try to fine-print on the inside of that warhead
Cross country, like a little lost junkie
Make them hot and jumpy, trying to get that God money
Steering the van through the blizzards, the fanfare
Pivot when we visit, spit victim if you stand there

[Brother Ali]
Take a map of this picture, throw a dart at it, that's where
We took a room back full of kids and threw our heart at it
Angry like a hostage, kicking like a little bitch in one of Dibbs's mosh pits
Shifting through your city limits trying to find the raw shit
Thread a needle with it, and weave a world of heads together, till we get 'em car sick
Face full of war paint, strapped, ready for action
Battle cracks heading, trying to seek the satisfaction of the captain

[Slug]
Climbed over the side, closed his eyes
Took a dive into his fame, inspiration for staying alive
Swam to the shore, stepped upon land
Walked up to a whore, grabbed her by the hand
And said

Hook: Slug & Brother Ali
Let the wheels spin, let the road shake
Let the speakers blow
Let the line in, let the kids play
Let the people know
Let the roof burn, let the girls love
Let the heat flow
Let the world turn, let the curtains up
Cats Van Bags, Yo

[Verse 2]
[Brother Ali]
Lock eyes with a thousand people at the same time
They minds believing this
My style of graffiti is
Squeezing just the midwest sweat out of my shirt
And leaving with my life essence embedded in your dirt

[Slug]
We work, move, and hustle with the rest of the gypsies
Spoon-feed these issues to a new school of fishies
Swimming through a hazy shade of passion
Here they come, the Hazleton has-been, and his chaplain

[Brother Ali]
Yeah, that's them, the migrants, seasonal workers
The finest imperial wordsmiths on the circuit
Two million smiles and runnin', stomping, trying to flee the heat
Turn around, shooting at the monster till his knees are weak

[Slug]
They call me Jesus Freak, I came to listen
Then I save you, then I make you my favorite position
Chasin' this pigeon down the street towards the banks
Just in case my traffic receives jeeps and tanks

(Bridge)
[Slug]
And we wander through this soul, so let it be known
Mama I dont know if I'mma ever be home
The revolution won't have any distribution
[Brother Ali and Slug]
I love my son and my music so I gotta keep it movin'
Like

[Hook][Verse 1]
I try to always buy final call from the F.O.I
Even though that's not what Islam always signify
Y'all gotta love the struggle in 'em
They would get on their knees and shine shoes
'fore they ever let the drugs afflict 'em
Makin taco's and fuckin with McDonald's
Nickel and dime broke, but dignified with high hopes
Some people shoulder the weight of the needy, make it look easy
Even though they walkin the tight ropes
Immigrants, twelve deep in one bedroom
I'm too cool, I look at 'em like fools
Those fools combine forces and put the resources
And guess who the new owner of the corner store is
Shit, what's stoppin me from doin that?
I probably could, rich drug smugglers are proof of that
Because if one dime sack in the time can climax
Into a billion dollar industry, then look at my abilities
But I'm a dreamer in a lot of ways
I feel if you believe in God then you believe in brighter days
Keep my son's heartbeat in my sleep
I'mma walk the Planet Earth with his name carved deep in my feet like

[Hook x2]
Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent

[Verse 2]
Born again christian preachers from the suburbs
Tryin to save souls on Broadway, they got some nerve
Comin here unaware that the ones with no material gifts
Sometimes are the most spiritually rich
Laziness got me spare the stand back and what was that
That can't hold me back, my man Vast told me that
"Harlem got all that on a bigger scale"
When there's bullets in the sandbox, it's every bit as real
I see children growin up within a wicked system
Smilin I wanna kiss 'em, I see prophet Muhammad in 'em
Poverty stricken, people from my generation are
Hands down the world's most creative
I've seen both sides of the fence
Picket a chain link and we ain't all thinkin the same thing but
They teens got so impressed by me
They try to walk, talk, interact and dress like me
We captivated the world's imagination
I used to idolize athletes and entertainers
Cause they never let the situation capture 'em
System gave 'em lemons, made lemonade and sold it back to 'em

[Chrous x2]
Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent

[Verse 3]
Marvin Gaye said it best "This ain't livin"
No matter your religion the earth keep spinnin
And the sun keep shinin, babies keep cryin
Old folks dying, in between you put your time in
And here I am, still lower class America
Same room, same view, different cast of characters
Regina got arrested as a late prowler
Couldn't trick, got evicted, lost her section 8 voucher
Onward goes my neighbourhood's revolving door
A gang of rental properties nobody owns at all
I guess that's why we call it a hood
Nobody stays as long as it takes to become neighbour

[Hook x2]
Children growin, women producin
Men go workin, but what's the use
When the real strive hard and stress about the rent
And can still die poor and in debt without a cent(Ali, the baddest muthafucka there ever...)

[Verse 1]
I'm chokin players like I'm Bob Knight, choke the coaches like I'm Sprewell
They bowin to the 'Sayers till they knees swell
I shake the game up worse than Single White Females
Walkin to they car alone flashin three bills
These little kids are talkin 'bout how little I know
Boy, I grab a mic and rock you like you're Triple 5 Soul
With a civilized flow, but if you say my name I'm like Beetlejuice
Dice you up and slap you till your teeth are loose
I've seen the noose and will not get lynched by the industry
Nor will I have a A&R pimpin me stickin his thing in me
I'd sing for free for some years if it's clear to me
That if I'm there for my team they're there for me
For real, I be diligently killin the soliloquies
Of these millipedes that try to pass themselves off as ill MC's
I weave a web of words so intricately
That the English dictionary lacks an adjective to fit me
If he want my album tell him not to fuck with ATAK
He was hatin and Slug told the bitch to send my tapes back
And if I lose my voice then instead of sayin raps
I start paintin facts on the wall with hot Crayola crayon wax

[Hook] (x2)
You're now rockin with the champion
You know you're in a war that can't be won
You need to stop and understand me, son
Cause I got a pocket full and I can hand you some

[Verse 2]
I wasn't lyin 'bout them muthafuckin hairy hands
Well how you think I tear a man till he can barely stand?
I share the land with hustlers hollerin my chorus back
I'll do anything for the cats that show support like that
When I battle they hold my back, y'all most be smokin crack
Eyes are screamin, "I ain't supposed to rap," come on, you know you're wack
These Minnesota cats touch down in places where it's dormant at
Bring they muthafuckin trophies back
I'm like big up my man Optimus Prime
I'm like what the fuck do rappers got in they mind?
I might jump on the stage and start hollerin rhymes
Maybe bend your back around and make you swallow your spine
Cause it's clear you ain't seen no one this tight in years
When I sing I can bring Brian McKnight to tears
I have to consume, Ali capture a room
And before my son was born I made him dance in the womb
MC's put up your titles, I be grabbin em soon
Them faggots are doomed, worse than breathing hazardous fumes
Like (* heavy breathing *) (There it is)
Yes, now let the magic resume, biatch!

[Hook][Verse 1]
I'm a trend setter with a wicked vendetta
Been feather, venomous, skeleton shredder, theres never been better
Plus my fourth to the tenth letter rip
Heads quick, you little chick, that deliver get a little glimpse at a
Ugly charmer, gentlemen caller
Sending them all to hell in a milk crate
Forest Whitiker dictate
You need to get the dick out your intake
You toilets in a gay bar, never gettin' your shit straight
They'll never find diamonds, as bright as my eyes
When I find where my competators hide
And then I slice 'em, Brother Ali, mean muggin MC
Is going toe to toe with 'em, stand nose to nose with 'em
My flow fo' sho' hit 'em
I thought especially, one word that I speak at a show could blow the whole system
Thats word from the big bad, fat ass, motherfucking, Brother Ali
Ugh...

[Hook]
You're now rockin with the champion
You know you're in a war that can't be won
You need to stop and understand me, son
Cause I got a pocket full and I can hand you some
You're now rockin with the champion
You know you're in a war that can't be won
You need to stop and understand me, son
Cause I got a pocket full and I can hand you some
