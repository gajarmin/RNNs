He's a fony and a fake can't relate to E
Certified and I'm coming from the C.P.T   [Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]
God bless these niggas like ha'chu (they wanna die, they wanna die)

[Lil' Eazy-E]
Little Eazy, young G in the CPT
Westcoast to the casket drop, (in south) block and I got that key

Anything else you asking for a nickel and a timly passin'
But it's all to the good in hood brings the wood

A heat seeker, infa-red creeper, real blood leaker
Coming through your speaker listen up close
Cause it's about to get deeper
About 6 feet I gotta sleeper with the reaper
9 milimeter go bang bang ba da da dang ba da da dar dang
Watch a little nigga do his thang, thang, he do his thang, you know I do my thang
I'mma rep for the Godfather
Gangsta music please believe me

Chasing money man It don't seem I can think about another thing

[Krayzie Bone]
It's another coming at ya, so you better pray
It's Mr. Sawed-Off just call me Leatherface
Here 2 brang drama if they really wanna it
But I don't think they really want it
If they knew just what I do to my opponent
Gonna be another murder moment
Ruff and rugged thuggish, ruggish, keep it ole soul gully
Really I'm knowing they ain't ready to see us put in down
With Little Eazy-E, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Always ready to get down
For whatever when ever you wanna go a couple rounds, c'mon
So anybody wanting beef, run up
We got it hot off the grill, son of the real
Raised on these streets man
So the treal, gonna recognize treal
Look whatever deal, the case, the situations none of y'all can never see Kray
We got 'em all trying to listen up and observe
The words hitting replay like man what did he say

And she got a man damn he bout to hate me

Chorus:

Let's get it crackin, let's have a ball
Get this chick to strippin, take your clothes off
Let's get it crackin, from now til dawn
Shake yo sexy ass and lemmie see yo thong

Go big every moment if I'm smoking
You know it's really potent, gotta get my mind right
Trynna' figure out why these rap niggas on the mic
I grew up, a little screw up
Touch a little money, then the nigga here blew up
But it ain't a thing, cause' I came from the sewer
Life's a bitch, and I learned how to do what
They switched up on me like some [???]
Fake niggas acting like they don't ride dick

[Verse 2: Eko Fresh]
Alles, was ihr macht, ist billig und recycled
Ich geb mehr als einen Fick, so wie Zwillinge, die geil sind
Und wenn sie meine Alben kistenweise aus dem Kaufhaus tragen
Seid ihr abgeschrieben wie damals meine Hausaufgaben
Zähl mit den Compton-Gees Geld, was aufs Konto fließt
Der beste Rapper auf der ganzen Welt, oder sonst wo, Piç
Mach schnell mit den Songs Profit, verdiene jeden Cent
Wenn ich GD represent, du nur Vizepräsident
Wie ein pesevenk fick ich Bitches regelmäßig
Doch deine fickt während ihrer Regel mäßig
Mein Leben dreht sich um Fans, money und fame
Alter, damn, kannst du es sehen? Wir sind N.W.A
Keiner setzt sich auf Freezy-B's Tron
Weil sich dieses Lied lohnt, zusamm' mit Eazy-E's Sohn
Ich bin ein Outlaw, Dude, der nur so vor Humor strotzt
Fick dein' Autotune, ich bin immer noch auf Talkbox

[Hook: Serious Sam] (x2)

[Verse 3: Brutos Brutaloz]
Es geht von Köln über Berlin, bis nach Compton
Hier komm' die drei begnadeten, doch zum hustlen verdammten
Das Rappen brachte mir bis jetzt etwas Kleingeld und Schlampen
Doch ob ich trotzdem weitermache? Darauf kannst du ein' lassen
Ich träum' nicht mal von hohen Gagen, aber warte, ich krieg sie
Meine Feinde haben Waffen, aber warte, ich wiege sie
Deine Stars sind für mich Babys, Atze, ich ficke sie
Du Hosenscheißer, ich komm mit Lil' Eazy und Freezy
Es fing an in Berlin City, bin danach expandiert
Hab die Spritze dem Game in den Arsch injiziert
Komm, mach nen Handstand von mir
Und dann noch gleich 'n Flick Flack
Das Rappen ist eh ein Zirkus, warum ich gleich da mitmach?
Ich bin zwar neu in den Charts, doch Oldschool wie Methusalem
Wie, du gibst mir nichts ab? Wir sind doch nicht in Jerusalem
Atze, ich werfe den Boomerang, doch er kommt nicht zurück
Er kreist nur noch um dein' Kopf, als wär dein [???] verrückt

Listen! They hide the knowledge of da law in da books
Cause they think! Most niggas can't read we jus crooks
So! When you get stop don’t say shit
If they ask tah search your car yo they can't do shit
If you not being detained you can drive off and split
Quit! Being ignorant wit facts at hand
Im just tryin tah let you know like Eazy man
Eazy man, these cops too greasy man

Chorus:

Song inspired by chapter 7 of the book
Black Empowerment & Minority Issues “Respecting & understanding the Law”[Hook: Timbaland]
When you hit me on my phone betta know what cha want
When you call me, you already know, on the low
Im sayin Hey! I got that(dro). I got that(drank). I got that(hoes)
I got. I gotta pocket fulla stones and im playin the corner
You want it, you already know, you sicko.Im sayin Hey!
About that. Hey! .about that. Hey! .about that. Hey! about. whoo!

[Verse 1: Lil Eazy E]
Lemme tell you bout a nigga named E (named E)
Im hittin corners in compton and movin work gettin profit
They tryna stop it but im so low key (low key)
They say with dollars come power
Im stackin mines by the hour
Man fuck that coward!
Imma, get while the gettin's good
Got boyz in da hood
And bundles of Kush
Muthafucka George Bush!
See he ain't helpin us, the streets they respectin us
Government ain't tryna help, so we just invest in us
Do whatever for a buck, in the hustle I trust
Moved from the back of the bus to a Maybach in a tux
Livin that good life. Still Lovin that hood life
This for my homies who locked down and doin life
They not on the grind for em
We served that time for em
Can't see ya did it for me, so I feel like I owe em
Now Tim Ridin with me, everybody tryna get me
Till the day I die im livin filthy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Lemme tell ya bout this nigga named Tim(named Tim)
Im well known in them corners V.A. to California
The game sowed up and you wanna blame him(blame him)
And throw yo side up
Homie nd ill throw minez up
Homie, till I retire
Only GOD knows when(knows when) im Mr. Mo'endz
If you ain't talkin paper I tell ya Go'on then
I gotta team of goons they kidnapping grown men
Duck taping wife and kids, thinkin niggas gone then
An when I ride by, I'mma let 'em slugs fly
Bustin my forty five,say hi to the bad guy
Yea, my swag is stupid, my style is celebrity
So I dont really gotta shoot'cha you already dead to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Eazy E]
And I ain't stoppin for nothin, can't get enough of it

???
[Hook][Intro]
This...
This is, Compton's in the house, niggas

[Hook]
Niggas keep screamin' that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]
It ain't nothin' to a boss when you gettin' it
It's the jump off now let the Crip in it
Joint hittin' it, eyes low stay steamin'
I'm the dopeman, dope hands stay fiendin'
Everybody wanna see a G, back in the phat rollin' thru the city streets
I guess... I guess I'm the one they wanna be
First son of a legend named Eazy-E
And now little E so famous
Hands on action, everybody so anxious
Game gon' change it, nigga face facts
You can hate it or love it while I just lay back
This Maybach put the loop on 'em
'64 Impala no roof on 'em
100 proof on 'em, I'm real with it
Think otherwise homie we can deal with it

[Hook]

Work it, on the block I work it, rock it up then serve it
Watch how fast fiends purchase
Nervous 'cuz cops is passin'
Hustle hard for the dough with the cops harassin', mashin'
Still tryin' to duck the coppers, see we all gettin' money so they love to watch us
Feds can't stop us, choppers is circlin'
Fiends need another fix so they chirped again
Keep a murk in him
When I'm stuck in the zone, back seat with the chrome
Homie trip then it's on (Then it's on)
Got the throne I'm just waitin' on the crown
Comp. town is the city, he just wanna be down
He a fake and he know that I'm the truth
I'll show 'em streets already know, so it's nothin' (So it's nothin')
Stop frontin' and you will be fine
You was once number one now that spot bares mine, boy!

[Hook]

So flawless, I'm lawless
Roll out the blue park, and I'm lookin' for targets
Watch them, he's hot don't knock him
That dude can't stop him, I'm one big problem
See (See) I told them that the game's over
I'm commercial without havin' to change over
A-1 bakin' soda, this that uncut
Kings of L.A. who tha fuck want what? (Yeah)

Grind hard for the dough dog, and rocks is costly
(Yeah) Still servin', still pitchin' it
Money on my mind so I'm still gettin' it

Rappin is easy when I'm sippin on some dranky dranky
Blowin my whistle while I'm brightin up some stanky stanky
I got her eating up talkin bout some take me take me
And she got a man damn he bout to hate me

Chorus:

Let's get it crackin, let's have a ball
Get this chick to strippin, take your clothes off
Let's get it crackin, from now til dawn
Shake yo sexy ass and lemmie see yo thong
Like a lawnmower man here we go again
Cuttin and cuttin and a huffin and a puffin
Just a beatin up and bustin, just to knock out a sumthin
Like a big pinata that now get's her humpin
I keep da crowd jumpin, keep da club bumpin
Like this mutha fucka got herpes or sumthin
So don't trip for I get's the dumpin
I'll have the paramedics at yo chest just a pumpin
But this is for da radio so I betta chill
For I get's a pop, pop wit dat stainless steel
Yeah I'm like dat and as a matter of fact
I hate snitch niggas so just step the fuck back
My name is Eazy but you can call me E
Or you can call me right now if you payin my fee
Oh you gat a gang of bitches off a gang of E
And all they wanna do is have sex wit me

Chorus:

The munchies got me hungrier than Ghandi
In my drop blow the top, up in John B
I'm hot your not don't remind me
On da block wit a Glock is where you'll find me
Tryna do da right thang like Spike lee
But these bitch ass niggas keep trying, eyein me
Tell ya on dat Ivy, Pop's still alive askin god why me
All I spit is poison Ivy
Nigga you sweeter than a whol pack of Hi-C
But anyhow, anywho, let's do the do
Pick up some Remy baby we gon' have a Bar-B-Q
I'm packin good and clean brought a gang of rubbers too
So bitches gimmie, gimmie lemme take a look at you
My love electric baby shock me like a pikachu
I see yo monkey starin at em playin peek-aboo
Bulgin out them thongs bout to bust through

Chorus:

The legend continues. Lil E, Big Swoop, Bomb Squad[Hook: Timbaland]

Man fuck that coward!
Imma, get while the gettin's good
Got boyz in da hood
And bundles of Kush
Muthafucka George Bush!
See he ain't helpin us, the streets they respectin us
Government ain't tryna help, so we just invest in us
Do whatever for a buck, in the hustle I trust
Moved from the back of the bus to a Maybach in a tux
Livin that good life. Still Lovin that hood life
This for my homies who locked down and doin life
They not on the grind for em
We served that time for em
Can't see ya did it for me, so I feel like I owe em
Now Tim Ridin with me, everybody tryna get me
Till the day I die im livin filthy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
Lemme tell ya bout this nigga named Tim(named Tim)

Only GOD knows when(knows when) im Mr. Mo'endz
If you ain't talkin paper I tell ya Go'on then

Duck taping wife and kids, thinkin niggas gone then

So I dont really gotta shoot'cha you already dead to me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Eazy E]
And I ain't stoppin for nothin, can't get enough of it

[Hook: Fingazz]
This is cut-throat gangsta music
New west coast, smashin' on you, bitches
You don't ride like we ride
Tryin' to pull a hot suicide
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E]
The gangsta rap king is back
Sittin' in a Cadillac, holdin' up my strap {*gun cock*}
This a new west coast smasher
Still on streets, I'm a Southside gangsta (SOUTHSIDE!)
Holdin' it down for the blue
With the Prince of Compton, and I'm rollin' right through {*tires screeching*}
I'm in ya hood
Pass me a drink
Make one wrong move and then I'll ground you a zinc {*gunshot*}
Tag a body bag {*police siren*}
Leaving a white hearse
The real G's are back, and I'm a hit 'em where it hurts
No mercy
S'a load of the barrel
It's the end of the world with my gangsta aparrell
Hush Puppies
White tees and Pennotins
Sippin' on a 40, real chin-checkin' veteran
Medicine
Where the club cousin fiend
I'm killa Cali's most wanted out that Big 1-3

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 2: Lil' Eazy]
Yeah
The spoke's stay turnin'
The police
Pass, the joints stay burnin' {*sigh*}
The 6-4 lean to the back
Levi's got a crease, E lean with a strap (Ha ha)
Cortez, black mack, got a beam on it (POW!)
I'm the Dopeman, block got fiends on it
Team's on it, that's money in the bag
Lil' Eazy is the name, same homey with the rag
Toes tag, you could die in the mix
I'm a west coast nigga, I'll reside as the prince (Yeah)
It's '06, and your boy got cake
Get Capone on the phone, say "It's on" in the states (Hello?)
I got weight, now it's time for the come up
Cocked and ready, your boy keep one up
Run up, and you're bound to get dropped
Still Ruthless (Ha ha ha)
Still hold it down for my pops (Yeah)

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3: Mr. Capone-E]
One
Two
Three and to the four
Capone-Double E, strong arm at your front door
Back with that gang-banger limo
With the legend Eazy's son, so the real just entered
Makin' the west coast tremble
Shakin' up the streets, Hi Power's the epicenter
Callin' out you lames
It's the full time jacking in the county of L.A
Eastsiders (SOUTHSIDE!)
Packin' heat
Easier said then done, that's why I'm on these streets
On these blocks
Still up to no good
Cause the boys in the hood ain't goin'
Hollywood
Never should
Cause the west is back
It's a new generation, new Regals and Cadillacs
New macks {*gunshots*}
And lay these bitches
Hardest to the heart, straight pound for pound

[Hook] - 2X

[Fingazz]
Yeah[Verse 1]
I know my life ain't promised
Being honest, that's easy
Seventeen star movie geezy
Back and forth to Navarra from Greenley
Homies on lock down, now I'm on TV
New CD, everybody play me
Two years ago remember everybody hating
Now everybody waving like they know me
Fake ass niggas still wanna be my homies
Same old E, same old swagga
Gangsta for sho' but I ain't no rapper, actor
Take a look at cha face, claiming you're from Compton
But you're a disgrace (put this dude in his place)
Wait a minute, he the same dude that got my face up in it
That's a lie
Pops died and I'm here to resurrect him
Real old G's gon' respect it

[Hook]
Cause they know me, but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me,but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me

[Verse 2]
Still back to the PG
That's pro gram and this eazy
Young [?]
Blue flag on me, I'm gangsta
Fuck it
No justice and still no peace
It's real out here in these streets
And with these beats comes a new legacy
D-O-C gave me the whole recipe
How about work? Don't need skills
645 stay fully detailed, clean
Team full of villains and doctors and natural born killers
That squill on their partner
And pops was the first to start it
Now these niggas act like they're really the hardest
Hard targets and I'm gon' stop them
Release day, we'll see who top them

[Hook]
Cause they know me, but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me,but they don't know you
Lil E certified G, i'm the truth
Take me out the booth and i'm back on the streets
Doing that work, saying fuck the police
Cause they know me

Cause they know me.... x3[Lil' Eazy-E & Krayzie Bone]

Me and my momma can't conflict me I'm a man

Ain't nobody frontin ain't luvin nuttin
Never slippin, never lettin fools put in a say
If it wasn't for this crush I'd still be doin the kid'n'play
Left, right, kick dat bullshit cause I ain't with it
Kill it all fuck a bitch shit
Set it srtaight by the crate pushin weed by the weight
Pops out there ruling these niggas in '88
And made history bitch with dat Westcoast shit
Pops was rich but I ain't have shit

[Chorus: 2x]
The Consequences will make you have to peel a cap
Lay low and I'm always in my '64 strapped
Bump yo gums and gap and you gon' get a dirt nap

You know I'm lying nigga I ain't givin dat bitch shit

Now add all the greedy people beggin on dey knees
Good and waitin to see you outa town mass nigga please

[Chorus 2x]

Yeah dis ain't no fad bitch a get rich quick scheme

Shot em in his voicebox with a hot block

If you not being detained you can drive off and split
Quit! Being ignorant wit facts at hand
