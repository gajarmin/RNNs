[Hook: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear your club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And you know, but you acting like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now homie, I say I "run it run it" cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feeling aight, I get you high as a kite
Party popping, shawty says she coming with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it; OK, now maybe I'm sidick
Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidick
You should see when I'm stunting, I flash the stones to be wanting
Push the whip, see me rolling, you can tell that I'm holding
I'm just doing my thang, you know the Unit's the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front, you gonna have to get me
Off your ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh
It's not a big deal, it's nothing but some cash

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Who run it?
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear your club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And you know, but you acting like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis
It's the same for him, it's just media; see, to them, it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef
You just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem, we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holding
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you wizzass
Come hizzon, what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', J.F.K
A.K.  'til your chest plate cave
I'll ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'mma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumping in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fucking G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

[Hook]

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement; you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it, then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids just don’t give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin' them hits "Oh, this my jam, this my shit"
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits?
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our sa-lyl-la-bles

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc is in the beat
Then I’m gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
Cause everywhere I go they love the "bling bling" flow
Bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost your man a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow, you bought the shit
I guess you to blame too, I just found an angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids
Who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong sa-lyl-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting, cause ever since then it's been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just looking for that hook (Wait Dre, look!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you and you love me too
We were meant to be cause
Shorty, you love me and I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, that's slang for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked Loc
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing, beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway, you don’t hear what I’m sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the fuck offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
New sa-lyl-la-bles eat ball, you fucks offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I’m running past while yall walk

[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringing it back
'fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spitting
About living in the mothafuckin' city you're at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you can never be
It's a hidden, rhyme in the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I’m crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I’m Rosemary’s baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook]

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot hot hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme schmo, mo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some goddamn records![Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist
[Eminem] It's The Re-Up[Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think, you're the top and king of the castle
You're about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby

[Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(STAT QUO!)We're back!

[Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns auntre, Aftermath, Shady!

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(BOBBY CREEK!)We're back!

[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga

[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(CA$HIS!)

[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga

Eminem - SHAAADDYYY!!!(Ha! I Told You We Was Back!){*guns cocking then one gunshot*}

[Eminem] Haha
[Ca$his] Ca$his, Ca$his
[Eminem] Yeah!
[Ca$his] King Mathers
[Eminem] C'MON!
[Ca$his] Pistol poppin, come get me nigga! {*echoes*}

[Hook: Ca$his]
Pistol poppin, bodies droppin, layin all around
You thought it was a game, now the neighbors callin out
The police find that, what's that sound?
While you layin on the ground with your fuckin brain out

[Ca$his]
Walk through the door with my hands on a gun
Cause niggas 'round here wanna ask where I'm from
I throw up my signs, step back and pop one
'fore you throw up your sign if you even got one
I used to bust niggas heads open for fun
Chase him down, stomp him out, if he tried to run
I could flip packs, get stacks, big straps, where it at?
Slung crack, real cat, you ain't never did that
Go hard, no peace, I gotta keep, chrome heat
I don't sleep, homie I'm watched by the police
Cops out patrolling, grab a Glock-40
Sniper at the squad car, story noting
Fuck it if you want beef, click-clack, wack rap
Tossed straps before, I'm out of here, homie
Militant in a sense, I don't really give a shit
Call up, Eminem, I gotta plead innocent

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
Sixteenth in my sneakers, I ain't listen to my teachers
I'm the most hated nigga alive, since Jesus
Maybe in the afterlife they'll reveal my Christ-like abilities
Come back, then ride on my enemies
Never been afraid of beef, metals of my bravery
War situations got you sayin he, crazy G
And emerge with the beat, I can serve anything
Especially anybody tryin to diss my team - Shady
{*blam*} G-Unit, Aftermath the same thing
So if you say them punk nigga you say me
I be in L.A. G, get at me when you see me
Catch you in O.C., and in the bag you'll be leaving
I ain't worried 'bout my freedom cause for me to get even
Is worth e'rything, it's on B.B.G.N
I son'd you folk, I'm lookin at your pinkie
You a fake-ass gangsta, what a waste of my scenery

[Hook] - 2X

[Eminem]
Maybe I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
Shady (Ca$his) we gotta push 'em to the back
Move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
It's got a catch but come on man, the raps
We all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
Who walk around with their chest out
Just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin about, Eminem
Cause I'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
And lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
Proof, you are the truth
Please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
Fake-ass tattooed havin
Fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
For me to try and, stay out it
But they just won't quit runnin their mouth
At least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
And as far as the snaps and claps, I wasn't
Dissin the South, that isn't what this is about
I just so sick of the beef, I don't even wanna see anymore

[Hook] - 2X[Obie Trice]
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Been ridin for Shady, Shady {*echoes*}

[Ca$his]
Geah, Ca$his know
Shady Records, the dream team, uh

Sittin in the back of the, all-gray Acura
Gun to the passenger for actin tough
Turn the wheel in the passin, heart of an assassin
Plus I'm on the draw down, quick as fuck
Last move 'fore I give all street shit up
Put a nigga in the ground face down, feet up
This nigga here tried to cuff me for my re-up
When I went to his crib he called police up
Now you on the way to bein paraplegic
For sendin messages through bitches like you go see us
Shady, Ca$h king of the dope fiends plus
Give 'em a square mile by blocks and I'm creamed up
Took the bullet out of Obie head, put it in my pistol
And use it, ammunition on the niggas they hit
Damn, I go to war on the regular man
Cause I'm part of the dream team, you a regular man
Far as rap I don't see no competitors and
You see things like me, with my medal in hand
I'm a state case boy with a federal plan
A hundred in beats, beatin the shit out skinheads
I'm the spirit of a G bringin lyrics of the street
I'm Ca$his, a real dope boy on the beat (beat)
Slumped in the seat tucked clutchin the heat
Basically, you niggas can't fuck with me, hah

[Hook One: Ca$his]
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Out to ride for Shady, yeah
Y'all niggas ain't hard, y'all niggas ain't real

The homicides that I've done lately
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Out to ride for Shady

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, Trice is back on the Alche' track
With Ca$his, capitalizin on this mic in fact
We fuckin with the captain of rap
My nigga with the Nike cap keep the continuity quite exact
So allure your cats into the second classic
We're mature as the number uno aspect, as yet
Who'll surpass the drive of O Trice?
The flow to die fo' and the death blow survive (woo!)
I echo through your external vibe
With internal experiences I've acquired (uhh)
I'm probably the most honest hip-hopper alive
A victim depictin images from my own eyes (yeah!)
Never livin through homes, why?
Homie got his own set of cajones, stand up guy
It's Ca$his, O. Tri', rappers we blow by
This is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie
Nigga!

[Hook Two: Obie Trice]
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Been ridin for Shady (Shady, Shady)
Y'all niggas ain't dope, y'all niggas ain't skill
Y'all niggas ain't crazy (crazy)
Bring it on if you want, you don't know
The homicides that I got lately (nigga!)
We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip
Been ridin for Shady (Shady)

Now we're comin for everybody who hatin
From '06 on, everything is Shady

You hit the ground and I snatch your bandanna mark

And we ain't backin down, way past rappin now
Right before my album drop my homeboys'll clap you down

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
A born winner, similar to mi familia

You all know who's pussy, by Vivica
I'm the realest nigga, you wanna Malcolm me?
If you a dealer nigga you can get box from me
I had rocks in jeans, socks of cream, Glocks and things
From March 7th, '06, got with the team
Now I'm on the scenes, reachin out flick it seem
Bein a celebrity bringin me mo' bitches
In a position I'm watched by mo' snitches
In place, at the end of the plots I hold niggas
Figures, are increasing, peace is not
Last week to a point where police was shot
And if niggas wan' know, what I been 'bout lately
Nigga take it how you want bitch, rap for Shady

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Ca$his]
Everything is Shady
I'm from the West coast
And the Midwest, C-A-dot, Ca$h!
Boats boy, block boys
We pioneering this, in a race to be legends
Now, Ca$h! We tie dot
I'm a Shady gangsta nigga[Intro]
Euthanasia, come die with me. You feel me. Let's go

[Verse 1]
My brother died and I can't do nothing to bring him back
When I was bring him beef he brought with me and brought me straps
Back to back in Cadillac smoking herb and
He a Vice Lord I'm 74 we put him work in
One thing is certain and two things for sure
He is the realest and he never got to die no more
But you dying is the reason all this crying for
I finding all your enemies take them all to war
You got killed by some fiends and now I'm set the score
I see him murdered in my dreams hurting me some more
Three in the morning and I am falling down on the floor
Your vision fading from my mind I'm screaming give me more
I feel your spirit boy hear me thorough my lyrics or
Be there with me when I am knocking up on heaven's door
[Bridge]
Nothing's change since you slain but a bigger trap
All on my brain wishing I could bring the Gilla back

[Hook]
Bring em back if I could
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back back back back
Bring him back only if I could man
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back

[Verse 2]
My uncle died and I can't do nothing to bring him back
I saw a vision of him dying and I woke up that
I saw my momma crying tears trying to hold 'em back
Telling us kids go upstairs or head up out the back
By how my mom reacted I start sensing that
In my dreams it was real should I mention that
The killer got ten years but we haven't forgat
You were supposed to be his friends but you clipped him that
23 years on this planet you took him wack
I got you tatted on my arm and I ain't looking back
Bogish boy till the world blow and its the pack
With 30 shots hit him no wonder why I'm always strapped
A cold world when your home boys peal your cap
But you got sons and loved one now grown and strapped
[Bridge]
Nothing's change since you slain but a bigger trap
All on my brain wishing I could bring the Gilla back

[Hook]
Bring em back if I could
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back back back back
Bring him back only if I could man
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back

[Verse 3]
My lady died and I can't do nothing to bring her back
She brought me real love when I'd never heard of that
I showed her too much in coming from to go I'm at
Suicidal homicidal when I live in fact
Daily you saw me riding against my brothers homicide
Brought me a baby girl and shelter me from suicide
My name tatted on your arm that's how I recognize
My lady lying under white trap dead to I
Our baby nine months old and I am terrified
It ain't no hope for me my life was only you and I
Now is nine years make 10 in July
I can't cry tears hold them till I drown aside
I know you are mad I been struggling with these diamonds right
I pray that God would take me to you laying down at night
When I am awake I'm on the couch with the pill bottle high
And hit the streets and do goony things till I'm gonna die
Since you have gone it's been nothing but this trauma I
Remain your man forever that's on our daughter's life
Nothing is change since you slain but a bigger trap
Wish I could change it all but I can only give rap

[Hook]
Bring em back if I could
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back back back back
Bring him back only if I could man
I wishing I could bring my Gilla back

[Outro]
If I could I would trust me
But I'll be there soon don't trip
You'll find out from all these suckers
When they are dying[Ca$his]
Ay,what up man?

[Ca$his]

[Gangster #1]

(Both Gangsters run away)[Intro: Obie Trice]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady, Shady
OOOOOOOOOOOOO-MIIIIIIIIIX ("Cryyyy")
Back nigga (dry ya face nigga)
"Second Round's on Me" (get it together)
Kuniva, Ca$his (I ain't goin nowhere)
Stat Quo, Bobby Creekwater (O. Trice) WHAT!

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas didn't kill me, now a nigga's gone
Can't, peel my cap back, I'm never at home
I'm somewhere, with my shaft restin on a ho's tongue
Sippin Dom Perignon while she sippin up them newborns
Yeah, bet ya hate the news holmes
He probably somewhere, sippin on a stoop, huh?
Sippin on a brew, plottin to pop me later huh?
When will a hater learn I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner, send weight to the coroner
When courage make him turn performer
I transform into Uma Therman, a dude's version
Verses lettin a 'perfluous nigga with no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed in hip-hop, watch out my services
Yet, you tried to murder this nigga that's comin
From the same turf as you's, nigga, what nerve of you's nigga
Pissed cause your hustles ain't worth a shit, nigga
I'm gettin rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's, dig?
With a bitch you in the trenches tryin to reach it big
On another rapper's dick who don't represent where you live
Know you're annoyed but don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga, not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you would never afford
And yep, it's probably E's but a nigga is on board

[Chorus]
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (cry now)
Cryyyyy now, (nigga cry now)

[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst - and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Creekwater]
Yo, Obie, they gonna fuck with us this time nigga (B-G-O-V)
Uh, Bobby Creek, nigga
Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin when he said you gon' be fine nigga

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissing you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull towards you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin the K, at hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed, deranged and more famous
Than clapping down bangers meant, for entertainment, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?
You copy?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Tony Yayo] Shady, Shady!
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Alchemist
[Eminem] It's The Re-Up[Verse 1]
Raised in the struggle
The drama I succumbed to
Made me a G
Some problems I gotta run through
Niggas can't walk on the blocks
That I done hung through
It's hard to have faith when nobody will trust you
Most Niggas dust you
Duck and scream fuck you
Now you realize the streets just don't love you
Remember seeing Rob a lot, and now he dead
We got the same face, my fate is
Misled
I was so caught up in ways to get bread
I let my brother's last days get wasted
Now I'm wondering, if we could trade places
But the strength from you
Got me bound to make it
I'm surrounded by family and friends
Knockin' Monique
Pushin' a rock, Countin' my cheese
This ain't for me
To your memory, I light up a flame
You're the reason my success came (I miss
You)

[Hook]
Dark Nights, Dirt road drinkin' Hennessy (drinkin' Hennessy)
What's
The reason you niggas gon' remember me? (What's the reason)
I am who I am
Cause my niggas live in me
What's the reason you niggas gon' remember me?

[Hook pt. 2]
Dark nights, dirt road drinkin' Hennessy
What's the reason
You niggas gon' remember me?
I am who I am cause my niggas live in
Me
That's the reason you niggas gon' remember me

[Verse 2]
Me and you was a team, you was a G
Sentenced by me, to live on these streets
I let my words bring life to the beat
Feel the story of a righteous MC
Could it bring brightness for me?
Daylight, tryina' dodge three strikes
Cause post partum depression done took your life
I was caught up in my own pain
Couldn't see yours
Now I'm placed in a spot where I gotta grieve more
Everything happens for a reason the tell me
So I think about it all while I'm leaf inhaling
It coulda been me, you sacrificed it all
So I could run around the town
Screamin' SHADY
My lifestyle crazy, my lifestyle made me see
I never lost you at all, and lately
To your memory I light up a flame
You're the reason my success came (I miss you)
[Hook 1 and 2]
Moral of the story, be thankful for life
Hard times build character, you faced with the right
Faced with the wrongs, tryina get faith through a song
My struggles enable me to move on
You can dwell in your own pity
Or rise through the ashes
And gain the focus to be alive with a passion
Cause a gang of my loved ones been blasted
I pray for the day that I be in a casket
I never knew one day, I'd be Ca$his
Rappin' 'bout things I did through ski-maskin'
Hard times give me the strength
To do what I feel
Keepin' yall alive through songs is keepin' it real
I'm pushin' a rock, countin' my cheese
Realizin' this ain't the life for me
And to your memory, I light up a flame
You're the reason my success came

I miss you
[Hook 1 and 2X][Verse 1: Rick Ross]
In the middle of the night we still shine bright
Lamborghini doors up, fuck 5 mics
24 carat Rolex, street merit
I’m in love with money, my women seen Paris
Bad bitches all bleeding in the red bottoms
Squad of cheerleaders but you know I rare doubt em
Pick them out, skip about, just to trick em out
Pop a rubberband purple rain pistol pow
Beverly Hills, chill that’s 70 mill
I love her becky but damn check out ebony hips
I’m in the M6 with a slim chick (boss)
I’m a big boy talking big business!

[Hook]
It's all in the name of love
All in the name of love yeah
I'll do anything for my favourite girl
It's all in the name of love
All in the name of love
Do it all for my money
I do anything for my favourite, girl

[Verse 2: Game]
Louis Vuitton Don
I say this a mother fucking cold world
Fucking with old girl
Life is a bitch and I'mma fuck it till the toes curl
2 feet up in this rap shit
Went from snapbacks to fitted caps
Back to snapbacks, shit ain't the same
The niggas know I was pushing 8 balls
Dreaming about Jigga's dough
How am I supposed to get it, though?
With 6 niggas hustling at the same liquor store
It's my corner, don't make me let that fucking four nickel go
Then I woke up, shit was just a bad dream
And that part of my life is just ink in a magazine
Four XXL covers, Source and The Vibe
Rap was an empty swimming pool, and I still took the dive
Now its Phantoms in my front yard, dobermans in the back
Wear my black coat black cause I’m the coldest on the track(track)
Matter of fact I’m the coldest in the game
Hence my fucking name, a permanent bloodstain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cashis]
I stack it I'm a boss like Ross
Haters round the world I'll ball at y'all cost
Stab blew that big straps I got em
Big digits, we go get it with no problem
Old school whips with a modern day engine
Its tuned to huntin the chip in em
Like Jordan back to back a champ you can see winning
God didn't front to true sinners
Money is my bitch a slave to die with us
She'll die to go with me
Blissfully ball till shots sent for me
We holding hands in the middle of the streets
Suckas want to get to you, they better bring the end of me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: K-Young]
Monte converted coupes damn right we shine bright
Miami sky line boy we love the lime light
Bad bitches with me I better fuck them all
She's sees the Breitling shining, she loves the Audemars
Bitches from Brazil count that half a mill
VVS stones bitch and them shits be real
Choppers in the ride so don't play with me
Catch a homicide and head right back to Germany
Louie loafers bitch I stay clean
S65 that’s my new Mercedes
Dope boy dreams balling like the 80’s
Sticking to the motto: "Nigga fuck you, pay me"[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
BME, trust the truth's in the booth
He don't take a hit to let 'em know I'm bulletproof
Rest in peace Proof, this is no truce
This is hood music brought directly to you
Mac-11 in the Chevy with a nigga or two
Ready for whatever, we cuckoo, loose screw
Used to bungalows juicing up fiends
Just to ride 'round in the new school
Come from basehead rentals, same faces, no dental
Claiming they gon' pay incidentals
Give a fiend a break, he see God all in ya
Then he run game 'till your change all minimal
Pinning them predicaments to live that life
I been spending Benjamins since the early '90s
Now BME is where a nigga can find me
Still on the grind nigga still getting mine
Nigga I don't slip, handle 'em, rap's Rip Hamilton
All in his mansion, gambling
Alls I'm trying to do is match 'em, rapping
Get a couple chicks, I'm rambling, stab 'em

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Everyting is real on this concrete and steel
Niggas peel your cap for a happy meal
I got to deal with this ball of confusion, world of illusions
We ain't losin' playa (never), weez winnin'
Playin' every night when we sendin' paper chasing, grinin'
While you still chasin' women 'round tables no lieutenants
Use your own man grown, (hook it up)
It's Ice Cube and the family stone
Breakin' bread every night in L.A
And I pray, for one more day that's unate (check it)
It's 90 degrees no enemies in sight
Even the Don gotta fall to his knees every night
I'm lovin' every breath like a cold sip of soda
While I'm bankin' down these back streets, thanks for lookin' over
Damn sure nice to know ya, fuck a four leaf clover
And thanks for this range rover
We gets down with this underground gangsta shit
Politians and parents, always havin' a fit
Everybody wanna know "who you with?" "where you from?"
Why you lookin' at me dumb?
Here's a bullet cause you number one

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
Soulja boy swag, cold so polar
I got so many cars, Soulja boy motors
Pull up and I’m flexing on rodeo drive
I got 55 racks and my pocket going live
Stacks on deck boys, we all about them plays
I be like hold on homie, you don’t know what we hate
It be hood dre flexing and sod flexing
I be pulling up on pipes 24 and flexing
Everywhere we go you know that we winning
Big bank wrote a letter know that we winning
Everybody know that my whole squad is winning
Stacks on deck, we gonn kill em, we gonn kill em
I’m pulling up and I hurt the haters’ feelings
Everybody know Soulja boy straight grilling
I’m on the hook and it’s a great feeling
Taking over everyday, niggas straight drilling

[Verse 4: Ca$his]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime


[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money[50 Cent] Shady

Shady crime fam in this rap shit is the dream team

[Hook: repeat 2X]
We took a break for a minute and now we bangin
But we've been listenin to everything you've been sayin
Now we're comin for everybody who hatin
From '06 on, everything is Shady

[Ca$his]
Killa Ca$h hard, 'bout to smash frauds
Lookin past broads, through the rampart
I can handle NARCs, when the cannon sparks
You hit the ground and I snatch your bandanna mark
We ridin out for Proof, it's Shady gang nigga
Hope you bullet-proof, fat fuck lame nigga
Know who I'm talkin to? Glad your man did
You 'bout to get it too, rest with your fam nig'
This a cold game, live by the codes man
E'rything you see is not, a 7-4 king
The son of cocaine, new form of dope man
Plus I'm holdin weight, cause I'm the dope man
A West Coast gangsta, Chi-Town goon
Interstate runner, watch me drive a brick through
And we ain't backin down, way past rappin now
Right before my album drop my homeboys'll clap you down

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
A born winner, similar to mi familia
County here I'm comin to burn your whole city up
I catch you up in the club empty the fifth on ya
You all know who's pussy, by Vivica
I'm the realest nigga, you wanna Malcolm me?
If you a dealer nigga you can get box from me
I had rocks in jeans, socks of cream, Glocks and things
From March 7th, '06, got with the team
Now I'm on the scenes, reachin out flick it seem
Bein a celebrity bringin me mo' bitches
In a position I'm watched by mo' snitches
In place, at the end of the plots I hold niggas
Figures, are increasing, peace is not
Last week to a point where police was shot
And if niggas wan' know, what I been 'bout lately
Nigga take it how you want bitch, rap for Shady

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Ca$his]
Everything is Shady
I'm from the West coast
And the Midwest, C-A-dot, Ca$h!
Boats boy, block boys
We pioneering this, in a race to be legends
Now, Ca$h! We tie dot
I'm a Shady gangsta niggaSmoke a doob, feelin CL Smooth
Watch full of Pete Rocks and she see no crew
Money spent, watch me reminisce over you
Abion flow, get hit with the bird flew
Cop it, new beat I'ma rock it
Kanye on your own shit, like Affion Crockett
Hoes go pop it, pussy sales, bitch get the profit
Now split it with me, evidently
On my team and haters gon' hate me
For whatever I sing but remain unseen
Like the heat in my jeans
Paint a picture so vivid niggas could live in my dream
Wait on the beam cause you can't go bitchy when you talkin' 'bout ki's
Fuck waitin' get cheese, put that on a G
Ballin' now, but just keep it low-key
Niggas know me, smoke weed, hella hoes on the team
Different chick if I wanna have a fling
I'm gettin' all this P for my niggas in the bing
Live vicariously through me
I'm cursed to the death like the one Bruce Lee
But I'm flyer than a crow, you gon' have to shoot me
Hit the gas on the ave. in the slab movin' bags
Take a drag, then I laugh
Success will make 'em mad
And jealousy's a trait for fags
You must got a boot loaded, so close your ass, bitch
Shouts to all my folks and the cash gets
Love 'em forever my nigga, this Cashis
Niggas know me from Uni, with the mothafuckin' tooly
Sophisticated, girls'll turn groupie for a nigga with the hoopty
Keep 'em in my zone like a 2-3
A biscuit and a two-piece, pimp
Cadilac roll on the strip
Bury me in this bitch like I'm Willy the Wimp
If there's something you don't get, nigga study the shit
Or live your life as a dumb fucked son of a bitch
Wayne got these dudes Bloods till they run into Crips
And they ain't tryna hear rap shit, they 600 with it
Two B's, one G forever
Like the gay Cub, Bradley
I tried to leave the street but a nigga gotta eat
Keep my fam straight, my only choice is to G
I'm livin' that thug life, y'all know the rules "gotta do what you gotta do"
Stay true, steady send the prayers to Jesus
Thinkin' forwards, aim juice, I pay dues
And get paid the same move
A real nigga, drinkin' Henny straight
Fuck the chase I'ma take it to the face
On a highspeed chase if the cops wanna chase
Get winded, still ended
Fuck it, so spliffed it
Fuck with it, puffin' to a bucket to a Benz
Chillin' with my friends now a nigga countin' ends
Big face hundreds, big face fifties
Come spend with me
I'm talkin' big face hundreds, big face fifties
Nigga come spend with me[Ca$his]
Yeah
It's Ca$his, I'm comin, uhh
Shady Records niggas, GO!

Walkin, with a semi cocked, flip down any block
Get cash, plenty guap, talk hard gettin shot
Went to war with the cops, you reach for what I got
Treat you like Singapore, swing a sword, you are chopped
Picture me pistol-free, "Look at me, look at me"
And realizing none of y'all is hood as me
That's on e'rythang, take six to your frame
Your son caught in strays, he gon' die any day
Try and act brave, tell the law my name
I bet your family won't live to see another day
There is no other way, you hearin what I say
I got paper now, I can fight the case

[Hook: Ca$his]
I'm walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule
Walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule

[Ca$his]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime
Stick, niggas for they shine, yeah, you been on the grind
Yeah, take your jewelry off and pass it to me, it's mine
Cohort, me and my cohorts on codeine
Conspire and rioting, robbin niggas for more cream
Step on work, eighth by eighth
Six points off a quarter nigga, stretch that cake
I ain't chillin on the corner, you fall in your order
For eightballs and nope, I ain't holdin nothin short, yeah

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
We live by gun rule!
Shady Records nigga
I'm ridin through to Annis{?}
With my forks up folk, G's up![Hook: Ca$his]
I'mma hustler, find me where it's raking in dough
And you a buster, softer than the regular ho
I don't trust ya, I'm riding with the iron you know
And when you hit the ground I'mma growl

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
You know that, uppercuts to repercussion for suckers bluffing
Tie him up, stuff him in the trunk, with the speakers bumping
My speech is rugged, it's cooking coke on the easy oven
Drunk, bumping easy does it, smoking on my weed in public
Attitude is fuck it, pullin' out my dick you suck it
I ain't talking lunch and when I say I'm bout my dreams and millions
And we thuggin' while you be clubbin'
Your life is like an afterparty till you see niggas running
Killas big as big pop slumbed in, and niggas ain't retaliating but nothing
And all that hard talk was just bluffing
Destined and disgusted and new niggas is not trusted
If it's money I'mma touch it, ball over it was something
Niggas live frontin', but I'mma die stunin'
Petrifying the pussy I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I keep my gun up by my stomach and I'm blunted
Bitches bogus, brand nigga
None of you pussy niggas want it uh

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
Did all the shit, man on my own
Look at my resume, that bitch long
Wish a nigga would say he put me on
(It didn't work), tears in the game going strong
And I've in this shit since like '02
Look at my bullshit I've been through
Niggas say fuck me, fuck 'em too
Nigga I don't give a fuck of none of them dudes
I'mma hustla, get your hustla
These rap bands is my customers
And my trap jump, and my trap jump, and my trap jumping like double dutch
These blow niggas is crazy, these DJ's fugaysie
I'ma made man, you ain't made me
Want meals son, you gotta pay me
Ghost rider, nigga check the credit
Gas man, all I spit is 91-11
Lot apologizing in the game
A nigga like me in apologetic
Niggas say that they real, nigga they fake as fuck and this shit pathetic
I call it like I see it, like I'm 20-20
And I tell you to your face, nigga you niggas pussy

[Hook] X2

[Verse 3: Roccett]
Come on, but Roccett you're rapping, you know when that rocket be killing
Yeah, my niggas is just dressing in black is my niggas is feeling
Yeah, we slang the coke up by the polo
Still riding in my polo, we go preaching like we no more
Bitch, We got the pistols and you know we shoot at
Cause all my niggas just like Nikey, all we do is do it
Uh, we have your bitch for a nighter
And that's your bitch so don't trip, we don't even like her
Look, I'm 'bout my paper, your mully, your baby mamas a groupie
My nigga snatch all your cookies, cause all you niggas is pussy
Cause their daddy's was pussy, all my niggas like Pac
So nigga don't even push me, I'm on the ground for this cheddar
You surrounded by cheddar, this little nigga was mean
Used to flash my barret ta, a big shout out to my team
And all of my bastards, a real coast nigga
Shout out to real nigga Ca$his we on it

[Verse 4: Crooked I]
If... you ain't got no paper left
Better get your paper right
I don't go to sleep, nigger
I don't even say good night
Get it day and night I'm slinging like I'm weighing white
Stay and fight buster Douglas
Slay a mic, hustlers love us
Y'all crazy thinking that you can compare me to other suckers
It's all gravy motherfucker cause I smother fuckers
Speak the language of the streets when I'm banging beats
I was slanging pieces back when Jeezy used to hang with Meech
Rocking more shine on the jackas
Winning bankers winning rich
They nose dive, getting close lined, like I'm hanging sheets
Slaughterhouse, Nickel, Joey, Crooked I, and Yaowa
How a group get a symbol by the higher power
Rifle power in my coup, I'm the Eiffel Tower
And my host has got more toasters than a bridal shower
Hear the pain in my voice when they hit the right pitch
I was born in a ditch but Imma die rich

[Verse 5: Goldie Gold]
Talk to the hit, here come off print, watch what you're sayin
Money chaser, paper chaser, many chaser
She don't case catch up
On the ' try my homicide
Every verse don't face your death oh
'. I'm on my watch, left post can knock ..
I piss on California shit on the south
Back to the gooder, past of my shooter
Take your free benz and ..
Just imagine what I'd do with you daughter ..

[Hook][Intro: Eminem & Ca$his]
(Remix!)
As the crabby little bastard that I am
Sly what the fuck a slick sick son of a bitch
Silly little rabbit don't you know Trix are for kids
This is what the moral to the story is
(Re-Up!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino, yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, and I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
From out of nowhere you might find your career
Come to with *eek* and I'm just like OH YEAH

[Hook: Eminem]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH

And where the fuck we goin', we're like NOWHERE

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
Cuz no one wants to walk around stepping in dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it
But the pride won't let 'em inside they like go get 'em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limited's in any size yo denim to velour
Even our clothing lines on fire
As 50 would said our clothing lines on fiya !
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah
And you all just like her you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y yessir
So full of joy boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you yeah boy don't curr

[Hook: Eminem]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH

And where the fuck we goin' we're like NOWHERE

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
(Ca$his!)
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor with a round
Spun around and hit the ground
You the new James Brown
New king of Mo-Town
Side with folk while
You not a G you a joke and they all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I just pray I get away after whoppin' your ass
From now on don't speak namin' your reps
I'll hop out yo' pussies restin' on blech
But I told you Ca$his consecutively sweet life off the beat all you hear is me
I'm A B.B.G plus a B.G.D Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive lil' guy you don't want it with me
And your man Fifty put your money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up, I'll crush that you know Cash up Shady!

[Hook: Eminem]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH

See me in the videos, I'm like OH YEAH

And where the fuck we goin', we're like NOWHERE[Intro]
Yeah, Blocc Boy on the beat
It's Cashis, spend some real shit
It's for my, it's for my seeds, nigga
It's still Shady though

[Verse 1]
Sit back right, all night spot post
Do the same thang, killing off black folks
Selling on the side, string save a mean more
To anything I own, watch crack being smoke
Got the picture of the seven little reasons
That keep, any nigga disrespecting me breathing
Still I be high, every time I see them
My babies, my angels and they are my freedom
I know I'm on the grind, lately I ain't coming home
They keep you in my life, I never leave your mom alone
You know I'm whyling out, straying strapped, ride or dying
You hear the stories 'bout your daddy floating 'round town?
But you call me up like, "Daddy I been finding out
That you caught Rico slipping, beat him up and stomped him out"
So when you go to school, you wanna do it too?
You just like me, how can I be mad at you?

[Hook]
You ain't had to live like I did and still you are just like me
Hell I even did a bid and came back to see you are just like me
The only reason I ain't kill myself is for fear you'll be just like be
You got the demons that's within myself, now I see, you are just like me

[Verse 2]
Standin on the block, tryna make my money clock
Servin situations, my nuts about a cock
I wanna stop but, y'all gotta have a lot
Even if it means sacrificing the life of your pops
I'm the breadwinner, I don't fear nann nigga
I don't trust nobody, I'm a man
Liquor, running through my veins, you running through my brain
I start to see your heart, we feel each other's pain
I talk to all of y'all when I say I love you mayne
One day we'll ball and I'll never have to leave again
Until that day comes, shorty be a G
I ride with y'all everywhere cause y'all are part of me
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my little niggas
Here go my hugs and kisses, never give you up for bitches
Promise to give you riches, all of my little niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Look how they talking shit, twice a year I drop a key
I bet nobody ever love 'em like they daddy did
I teach 'em young, don't be rolling on no scary shit
Long as you love each other, you'll be very rich
Everybody question how I be affording this
I make my money off of dicks and spend it on my kids
I'm sending messages in bottles of imagination
So they can feel my presence, though they at home just waiting
My soldiers still in training, throwing up forks like they banging
Know how to bogart, and never trust a stranger
They the ones I look to whenever I'm in danger
We walking holding hands, interlocking trigger fingers
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
And a father so my conversation must remain gangsta
This is my record to my kids, I'm a banger
And a father so my conversation must remain gangsta

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, it don't get much realer than that, Shady, Cashis, nigga
Be a man, take care of yours that don't make you no less gangsta
My nigga not take care of his, I take care of mine homie
I'mma give a individual shoutout to 'em, Miana, Jasmine, Ramani
Rashanti, Lil' Mone and Rah Monique, Tavian, they are just like me[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm in my old school roll in
Cocaine around me
Bout to cross the state line in Davidson County
In the back of the projects is where they found me
I think we need a flood
So I told my plug to drown me
Swim N*ggaz
A black tee with a pair of Gucci tims n*gga
And you ain't get it from me
You got it from him n*gga
A couple fiends who been waiting on they checks
You been short all month
So you gone take what you get
Chattanooga been shopping in the A
But not no more
Cuz I'm back distributing the Yay
My price is lower
Knoxville ain't had a deal with the pills for a long time
Now here it is motherfuckers and I want mine
Some Memphis n*ggas that I know that just jack
They don't know you, they on you so Gotti nem gone handle that (A)
1 thing that's a fact n*ggas know
That when it come to fuckin' with the pack
We just get it and go (10 a key n*gga)

[Hook: June B]
I'm a Kingpin
You know I'm sitting on top and
I got the merch if you wanna go shoppin'
You can get it for the low
I promise everything will be a go
That's why My city love me
(Oooooh)
Everytime I come around
I swear to god my city love me
[Say they love me, yeah yeah]
Say they love me in my city
I'm a Kingpin

[Verse 2: Ca$his]
Belligerent time, ignorant rhymes, manipulated by crime
I'ma baby from the 80's coke crazy and grind
ACP protect me from who blocken my shine
Flippin' green like white 6 figured delight
Same clothes for a week but then you look at my ride
And see everything you dream you can be in yo life
Straight tippin'
Moving brown and white
Blake Griffin
And I'm lob city banging, busta
Set trippin'
A youngin with a 1/4 mill
After bail and legal fees back broke for real
I came right back like nice crack
For good scratch from good packs
Streets is watchin'
That's hood facts
Juxen the crooks
My 45 I could flip off a look
Live by the script of a book
Hustle hard, no shook
Business over here
Cuz it's heavy with the army
Control like Ghandi
Til' I'm gone like Gotti (I'm gone)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Arez Cobain]
I remember late nights with my baby mama back in highschool
We was Bonnie and Clyde
Ridin' dirty with the white tool
She got me on my feet
Helped me cop my first O
Thought the love was deep cuz she stood by when all the world seemed artificial
Guess the love was unofficial cuz her confessions blew a whistle
Had me singing different tunes
Sealed my heart inside a tomb
So I can never love again
Its probably better I assume
Put my heart into the hustle
For my lil man's came out the womb
Now I'm only get older and wiser as a hustla
Snatch a lilly pad to write a verse on budweisers
What you know about pink slips and bills being past due
Kids on the phone wish you was home
They always ask you
Daddy when you coming home?
I miss ya
When can I see ya?
Blowin' kisses through the phone
Hoping and praying
That they can forgive me like I was in jail or locked up
Cuz everytime I pop up
I got gifts and toys for the time we lost
Fuck

[Hook][Ca$his]
Screech out, yeah
That's what I'm talkin 'bout {*bzzt*}
Ca$his, Shady {*bzzt*}
Good lookin Em

We in the Cadillac Cartel and Snoop DeVilles
Ridin on Treys like Barksdale, I'm movin steel
Step out and see the new Car-mellos you would steal
But you ain't runnin around here cause dude is real
You dub for fifteen minutes sayin they shoot and steal
I would tell you more, but I think, you would squeal
I'm ridin at the wheel, lean back, poppin pills
I make a lil' side money plus I got a deal
I'm nine kids deep; see, why I gotta deal?
And serve so the government, can't touch my skrill
Before I'm sittin in my big, house, on the hill
Dark, not in H.B., Hall go, have a meal
I am the bogus boy, that was in my uncle's will
You figured that out, and see that I'm a G for real
And fear man is one thing that he don't feel
Knock a nigga out, while his gun on him still

[Hook: Ca$his]
'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)
West (West) coast (coast) beatin down yo' block
That's how we do it out here, out here - folk
That's how we do it out here, back forth - folk
Back on the 'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)
West (West) coast (coast) beatin down yo' block
That's how we do it out here, out here - folk
That's how we do it out here, back forth - folk
Back screech out

[Ca$his]
New Makaveli jeans, five Vicks, Blue Leaf
Tall tee, hang to my motherfuckin knees nigga
I got a gang of my partners from O.C., figure
If it's some drama they all, ridin with me if ya
Recognize a situation that you can't win
You may feel like a marked mellow but you can live
Still you tryin to be hard, yellin out stupid shit
I just look at you laughin, say that you a bitch
I got somethin from class despite my truant seers
But I can whoop on yo' ass homie if you in Sears
It's better not to be brash and come with foolishness
Talkin 'bout my county 'til you see how true it is
Come to the 7-1-fo', Glizzy could get you rich
Some of the homies got dough, the rest is militant
We got goons that's loon tootin them wicked sticks
My whole set to end, Shady that's what the bid'ness is

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
We switchin lanes and candy paints on 22's
And '83s and '88s, in grammar schools
Different names of the 'Llac, I hear the hundred crews
Miss the exit, that's all from gettin blunted fool
Flick the tussin, a couple buzzards is comin through
Soon as they see me say "Ca$h, I wanna fuck wit'chu"
So many niggas is lamed out, and gullible
We make 'em lookouts in fog eyes for copper moves
I was livin the life, of sellin rocks to dudes
When I got to a block, I was unstoppable
I had to serve out the 'Llac, cause they was watchin moves
But bein poor was just, somethin I couldn't do
I wanna roll in a six-hundred and stunt on you
Next time I see you and yours, I'll pull a gun on you
Through every stage of my life, I been that fuckin dude
You should be glad I took, time to fuck wit'chu

[Hook][Intro: Ca$his]
Capo
Chris Link
Lights Out

[Verse 1: CHL]
Chris Link my given name
CHL my written name
And god blessed me
To kill in this written game
Grew up in Brooklyn
New definition of lights out
Generator went dead
The whole projects was lights out
Try to steal our product
Yeah it's lights out
So when I go to the booth
Turn the lights out
So I can think of all these crimes
Writing all these lines
Russ told me
They love me for my raw rhymes
Cause I really do it
The streets knew it
What to meet in Queens
See you on Conduit
I'm the bomb stupid
Cause I'm bout to blow
See me in the streets
Never think I was professional
But looks can be deceiving
Just like a bitch
No I don't cuff em
I'm just getting rich
It's CHL in this bitch
This that CHiL Factor
I was local before
Now you hear me after
Started in the streets
Now I'm world wide
I was raised to grind
Thats my G side
Always shady
Rocking with Ca$his
Bury you in the clay
Call me Cashis

[Hook: Ca$his]
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now
Lights out
Cut on the Mic
I rhyme right now
Lines of my life come out
Your bread right now

[Verse 2: CHL]
This hook got me feeling like EM
Hard white rapper
Killing with the pen
Cooper Projects
Thats my 8 mile
But I stood through it all
With a lil smile
Truth is I was raised for the streets
And god gave me flow
To kill all these beats
And then came aggression
To bring all the heat
And then came your bitch
To rub on my feet
I got swag
I could take her in a min bro
But fuck that
I don't want that nasty ho
Maybe if I was drunk
With the lights out
Pretend she Megan
Then It's lights out
But I ain't doing that
I need a bad bitch
And I can get her with swag
Being Hood Rich
I could go Ratchet
I could go Preppy
I'm a pimp bitch
Call me Hugh Heffy

[Hook: Ca$his]

[Verse 3: CHL]
Let the beat breath

Every time I'm in the booth
Cut the lights
So I'm alone in my mind
Like Jesus Christ
But It's Hell in there
I've been through it all
Christmas Miracle
That I never fall
Sometimes it hurts so bad
The way I feel inside
When I think
About my first homicide
Then I turn to drinking
Till its lights out
Or I turn to rap
And bring the mics out
Or I turn to drugs
And I just get high
Whatever I got to do
Just to get by
Never thought that I would make it this far
My life like a road trip in a shitty car
Roller Coaster
I got my up and downs
So every time I smile
That means I'm gonna frown
Till the day I get signed
And take whats mine
Bitch I'll be fine
I just gotta rhyme
My first album
Called the CHiL Factor
I'm Mr. Hard White
And I'm an ill rapper
I'm gonna make it
I'm taking you with me
Y'all my G-Unit
Call me 50

[Hook: Ca$his][Hook: sample of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen]
Momma, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Momma, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

[Ca$his]
Geah, it's Ca$his, Shady Records
Real music, not fool music

There was just - a lot tears shed over what you been through
A mother's pain pays, for what her kid do
As Brian light fades, in the rearview
You enslaved to her, but gotta skid through
We was both bangin, Brian and I
Different neighborhoods so we chose different sides
Confrontaton in the street, so we had to ride
I won the fight, his pride felt I had to die
He screamed 1-8-7; I say, "I never hide"
You know where I'm at boy, I ain't hard to find
A couple weeks went by, we passin time
He seen me in the alley with his niggas, I
Was just dealin off Cavi then I seen the .9
Then I, heard a shot, he just kept firin
I started runnin, duckin, now I'm hidin
The whole time conscious of my own homicide and
I got away, click-click in the nick of time
His clip dropped down, he start signifyin
"You a bitch Ca$h, run with your bitch ass"
Heard sirens, then I heard him hit the gas
Right then, I knew your son wouldn't last
I said to myself, "Folk, I gotta kill his ass"
Roll through my apartment, hit the buildin fast
Gun out of my closet, hit the stick and dash
Put the, strap in my pocket, on my mission I saw him
Down the block sittin back, sippin 'gnac
I walked up like, "What's the business fam?"
He stared death in the eyes, then he shook his head
The broad he was with, shook as fuck
Put the barrel to his head, buck buck buck!
He fell to the ground, grass covered with blood
I probably go to hell for what I did to your son
I walked off slowly bugged, I ain't run
It's been five years, and no it's never over
He left me no choice, I offer you closure...
He left me no choice, I offer you closure

[Hook]

[Hook 2X: Ca$his - overlapping Hook]
Dear Ms. Jenkins, I send you my love
Hi, I'm Ca$his, I murdered your son
I'm closin the chapter, on what has begun
Dear Ms. Jenkins, I murdered your son

[Ca$his]
Dear momma, if you gettin this letter
I'm dead, I'm sorry if you gettin this letter
Wait - I'm sorry I ain't live a lil' better
My own selfish will wouldn't send you this letter
See - I had my hat cocked on the wrong spot
I threw the right sign up, on the wrong block
Blaow, blaow, bloaw! Ramone shot
Fuck a Ca$his momma! Ramone shot
It started as a fight, on a distant night
But far off the homicide, pistols tight
We still... grieve over your brother
Now you, grieve over your son - what the fuck?
He squabbed me up, this my hood
Some nigga named Ca$his from Chris' hood
He supposed to come back with iron, I ain't scared
Yes I am momma, I don't wanna be dead
But I can't run; too late, to try and change it
Born as your son but dyin as a banger
When my name gets discussed for entertainment
Never share this letter with a stranger
Please, please

[Hook] + [Hook]

[Ca$his]
Dear Brian, it's Ca$his, I can't sleep
I had to bang you, before you bang me
Just like I blame you, you could blame me
We both gave up our lives for banging (yeah)
We didn't know each other but we share the same hate
Your death is my life, so we share the same fate
This ain't what bangin was for, killin for nothin
Your death gave karma for the death of my woman (Monique!)
I'm tryin to make amends cause within I'm croak
But outside I'm hard, my friends don't know
I'm sorry that I killed you, I know it don't mean shit
We both could've stopped it, if we only seen shit
Happens for a reason we don't even know it
When you leave here, do you know where you goin?
I'm sendin my apologies through a song
Maybe we can reconcile when I'm gone

[Hook] + [Hook]{*guns cocking then one gunshot*}

[Eminem] Haha
[Ca$his] Ca$his, Ca$his
[Eminem] Yeah!
[Ca$his] King Mathers
[Eminem] C'MON!
[Ca$his] Pistol poppin, come get me nigga! {*echoes*}

[Hook: Ca$his]
Pistol poppin, bodies droppin, layin all around
You thought it was a game, now the neighbors callin out
The police find that, what's that sound?
While you layin on the ground with your fuckin brain out

[Ca$his]
Walk through the door with my hands on a gun
Cause niggas 'round here wanna ask where I'm from
I throw up my signs, step back and pop one
'fore you throw up your sign if you even got one
I used to bust niggas heads open for fun
Chase him down, stomp him out, if he tried to run
I could flip packs, get stacks, big straps, where it at?
Slung crack, real cat, you ain't never did that
Go hard, no peace, I gotta keep, chrome heat
I don't sleep, homie I'm watched by the police
Cops out patrolling, grab a Glock-40
Sniper at the squad car, story noting
Fuck it if you want beef, click-clack, wack rap
Tossed straps before, I'm out of here, homie
Militant in a sense, I don't really give a shit
Call up, Eminem, I gotta plead innocent

[Hook]

[Ca$his]
Sixteenth in my sneakers, I ain't listen to my teachers
I'm the most hated nigga alive, since Jesus
Maybe in the afterlife they'll reveal my Christ-like abilities
Come back, then ride on my enemies
Never been afraid of beef, metals of my bravery
War situations got you sayin he, crazy G
And emerge with the beat, I can serve anything
Especially anybody tryin to diss my team - Shady
{*blam*} G-Unit, Aftermath the same thing
So if you say them punk nigga you say me
I be in L.A. G, get at me when you see me
Catch you in O.C., and in the bag you'll be leaving
I ain't worried 'bout my freedom cause for me to get even
Is worth e'rything, it's on B.B.G.N
I son'd you folk, I'm lookin at your pinkie
You a fake-ass gangsta, what a waste of my scenery

[Hook] - 2X

[Eminem]
Maybe I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
Shady (Ca$his) we gotta push 'em to the back
Move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
It's got a catch but come on man, the raps
We all gotta step our game up; especially these lame fucks
Who walk around with their chest out
Just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin about, Eminem
Cause I'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
And lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
Proof, you are the truth
Please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
Fake-ass tattooed havin
Fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
For me to try and, stay out it
But they just won't quit runnin their mouth
At least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
And as far as the snaps and claps, I wasn't
Dissin the South, that isn't what this is about
I just so sick of the beef, I don't even wanna see anymore

[Hook] - 2X[Intro]
Yeah,uh,Shady!
It's Ca$his
Serenade My Life
Shady!

[Verse 1: Ca$his]
Focusing on opening
Emotions that I hold within
Surrounded by my inner demons
Thinking I should roll with them
I don't wanna go to hell
I don't wanna go to jail
But I wanna kill a man
Maybe I should kill myself
I've been sittin'
Contemplating suicidal situations
Now I'm placed in that position
To abide the whole nation
And I'm spottin' n*ggas hating
I'm just watchin'
Being patient
Praying for my own existence
Some say I'm a mental patient
Drugs is taking over me
Sorrow is controlling me
Follow my blind heart
Tomorrow run the coldest streets
I've been cryin' for a week
Will is weak,can I speak
Without someone judging me?
Pushin' me and shovin' me
Mama if you love me
You will really let me go
But I live for a cause I don't really know
Am I wrong if I cry?
But I can't cause in time
For the truth in my life
I will be crucified

[Hook X2]
I'm sitting back patience (patience)
I'm ready and waitin' (waitin')
For my homicide
Serenade my life
And I can't escape it (scape it)
I'm ready and waitin' (waitin')
For my homicide
Serenade my life

[Verse 2:Ca$his]
Conversating with my brother's spirit
I hear him saying
Strangers in the dark, lurking
You just gotta feel them 'em waiting
I ain't eating
I ain't sleeping
Close the door and I ain't breathing
Death is running over me
My conscious is showing me
Ever since my early teens
Knew this was my destiny
World gotta feel my pain
I'm no longer questioning
When, where, or how I will
Happen for when I get killed
Never take my voice away
Through record sales how I live
View me as the realest nigga
Poppin' pills, drinkin' liquor
Sucked into the pressure makes me turn to my aggression
Got a lot a homies dead
Buried all in my head
Cry inside every time
I never stop to read my hands
How could I fear a man?
I've never been near a man
All ya'll fraudulent
You don't like it, kill me then
I've never been near a man
All ya'll fraudulent
You don't like it, kill me then

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3:Ca$his]
Sunk into a sea of self-misery
Being dealt
My only fear is lyrically
Me not being felt
Much hard, much smarter
More true, fuck you
No matter what the conversation
This is what it comes to
Imagine staring at your friend
Feeling they don't love you
You ride till the end
But they feel they above you
I got a chosen few
Name my homies in the song
Defy all odds
More for me when I'm gone
I try to be a better man
Baby if you understand
My love for you is true
But I ain't really love myself
See nobody wanna help
Better off to end this way
Talking to my friends
Weed, G's and Hennessy
Came from a broken home
Smoke till the dope is gone
Listen to the words homie
This ain't really just a song
Came from a broken home
Smoke till the dope is gone
Listen to the words homie
This ain't really just a song

[Hook X2]

[Outro:Ca$his]
Serenade my life
Shady Records on Ca$his
This is real shit
Serenade my life
I ain't scarred, I ain't runnin'
I'm waitin', come get me nigga
Live as a man
Die as a man
Yup![Verse 1]
Walkin' off of Vicodin, somethin' Xanax, I'm likin' it
Take a couple pumps of the coach, now I can write again
Hennessey thrown up on the floor, OG I'm lightin' it
Takin' wax dabs till I'm certified higher shit
Jordan, I'm supplyin' to many ballas admirin'
Forever be alive to any sucka who tryin' him
Why's it them are liars, despising these phony guys
This side of me, I survived, thanks to Marshall I'm alive
Ain't your business, why G-O-D stay on my side
Though I'm gettin' high, livin' real until I die
In my sinners life, no regrets, I get it right
Before they out my lights, changed man, a sacrifice
So I never quit, fuck you bitch I hold my stripes
And I'm a lunatic, who gives a shit, let's die tonight
And mourning might do for my song, will I get sniped
Slaughter if you want, bet a part of me, I'll go to Christ

[Hook]
Summer on to summer, I'm a gunna
I'm tryna mind my business, you can run up if you wanna
It's money over bitches, yeah I'm always on the come up
And niggas hatin' on me I'm a mothafuckin' stunna, a stunna

[Verse 2]
Lately, I go crazy and my lady ain't gon' save me
And neither of my baby's, euthanasia for me, baby
These niggas ain't gon' break me, these niggas ain't gon' break me
Swear to God if you hatin', pussy you will never break me
I fell back to the samie I been givin' niggas lately
When I spray y'all with the K rounds, till you lay down almost shakin'
I can't say I'm in the dark cause I was there but niggas blazin'
I shot everything, Plaxico, Caijian, I'm not a racist
I stare in baby's faces, fuck their momma till they cave in
She givin' me the pussy but I'm fuckin' like I take it
Make it, face it, a problem, I'm waitin' patient for all you
Who give a fuck about stripes, one day is what they call you
Bitches shuttin they cell and I'm sayin' sacrifice all you
But racin' to be the greatest, I pray to God one won't call you
Catch me in the mall with my pistol I'm ballin' on you
Worse than before, I'm even more realer, Coppo's the motto, model

[Hook]
Summer on to summer, I'm a gunna
I'm tryna mind my business, you can run up if you wanna
It's money over bitches, yeah I'm always on the come up
And niggas hatin' on me I'm a mothafuckin' stunna, a stunna[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and A-B-C it, then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids just don’t give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ's playin' them hits "Oh, this my jam, this my shit"
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits?
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13-year-olds control the remotes?
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our sa-lyl-la-bles

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc is in the beat
Then I’m gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
Cause everywhere I go they love the "bling bling" flow
Bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost your man a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow, you bought the shit
I guess you to blame too, I just found an angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids
Who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong sa-lyl-la-ble

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting, cause ever since then it's been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what? Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just looking for that hook (Wait Dre, look!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you and you love me too
We were meant to be cause
Shorty, you love me and I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, that's slang for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked Loc
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing, beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway, you don’t hear what I’m sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money

[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the fuck offs, all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
New sa-lyl-la-bles eat ball, you fucks offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I’m running past while yall walk

[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringing it back
'fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spitting
About living in the mothafuckin' city you're at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you can never be
It's a hidden, rhyme in the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I’m crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I’m Rosemary’s baby, I want you to hate me

[Hook]

[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot hot hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme schmo, mo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some goddamn records!
