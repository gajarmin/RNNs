Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Oh no! The fight's out

There's something wrong, we can't stay still
I've been dranking and busting too
And I been thanking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, they'll be mo' dead
Causing confusion, Disturbin' Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we running the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and gold diggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? No nigga!
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my way
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you abouts to get ran the fuck over

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Mystikal]
Here I come, here I go
Uh oh, don't jump bitch: move!
You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck 'em - true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
Oh what's up, getting my dick sucked, what are you doing
Sidelining my fuckin' business
Trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TV's and jewelry bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'mma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - I-20]
2-0, I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack

We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the pills cause we robbing tonight
Beat the shit outta of security for stopping the fight
I got a fifth of the Remy, fuck the Belve and Cris
I'm selling shit up in the club like I work in that bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwing bows, beating up niggas

And watch the bottles start flying from the V.I.P
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in ya body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way ho
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0[Bruno Mars]
Ladies and gentleman, give it up for Mystikal

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Calling all cars in here for the Prince of the South
Fuck that yabba-dabba-doo shit, bitch, I just got out
Still rapping, slapping kittens and grabbing my cock
I'm the artist, the godfather, still hard as a rock
You gon fuck around and make me knock your fruit juice loose
Banana, your watermelon and pomegranate too
Rhyming kung-fu that split bamboo
Crowd rockin', ain't no stopping that rapping ass fool
I been bad, bro, 'cha getting mad for?
I'm gon' have to fuck you up
I eat flames up
Shit fire out
Don't make me light my butt
Excuse me, who me?

Oughta have a fucking doghouse like Snoopy
Curtains go up
It's going down
Tear the thing out the frame
Like my band

Come on, come on

[Chorus]
Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker

My whole hood in this motherfucker

And we gon' rock this motherfucker

And we gon' rock this motherfucker

[Bruno Mars]
Mystikal, don't hurt 'em now

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Grabbing at my pants, she trying to pull it out my pocket
Don't yank on the motherfucker so hard, you're gonna pull it out the socket
It's exercise with thighs and hip muscles
Next exercise, we gon' burn some lip muscles
Let the music work your ear muscles
And if you're skinny then use your little muscles
Bag back or tea bag with these duffles
Pow pow get smash when we hustle
When the last time you have a knuckle sandwich, huh?
The last time a nigga had a foot so far up your ass you couldn't handle it?
You can't stand it
To make matters worse you gotta go to the studio with Bruno Mars on another planet
Don't get mad, I'm just saying
Don't believe it cause I'm saying it, bitch
Believe it cause I'm telling you
I'm doing the rapping and bussing
Ronson on the scratchin' and cuttin'

[Chorus]

Get down
Wait a minute now
Give it to them on the one

[Bridge]
This the intermission
I'll break it down so you niggas listen
Take a second to wipe my sweat
Might be the only chance you get to catch your breath
Don't get too comfortable in here
Niggas know I'm bringing back the rumble in here
Just when you thought you could cool down and sip some of that water
Shit
A nigga back
Say it again

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
Ladies and gentlemen, one more time
Put your hands together for Mystikal
Don't it feel good?
Ain't he making us feel good tonight?
Thank you Mr. Ronson for bringing us together this evening
We gon' go ahead and head over to the after party
We'll see y'all uptown
Come onMGK:

Got all these crazy white boys yelling Cobain's back

[Hook]

[Verse 1: 2-Chainz]
(Yeah)
(2-Chainz!)
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me 2-Chainz
Eat your girl, wear my necklace, call it food chain
I'm a Wild Boy, been that way for a while boy
All I kill is beats and pussy, still ain't went on trial for it
South Side, my chain glowing
If them lames going, then I ain't going
My aim good, my pistol dirty
Chopper clean them like dish detergent
Kobe Bryant, but the sicker version
Big Meech, but the spitter version
Stacey Dash, but a thicker version
Getting head while the engine running
UGH!

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
(Meek Milly)
(MMMMMMM-Maybach Music)
(Aye)
I'm a Wild Boy, strapped down like a cowboy
I'm really in the game, you just a towel boy
I pull up in that thang all on them alloys
With so many carrots on, Bugs Bunny'll die for
Your bitch call me Steve-O, cause I ball like I'm D-Rose
My neck be on Sub-Zero, and I won't save her, no hero
My wrist done cost me a Maro, got your whip on my wrist
You keep my name in your mouth, but it keep your bitch on my dick
Nigga!

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Bitch, I got my beanie and my hoodie
Here go the dick, bet you know where to put it
I'm harder than Buckwheat's head
You niggas softer than jello pudding
I stack them up, I keep counting digits
You falling down to London bridges
Laughing at you bitches like Nana-BooBoo
Bitch, cause I'm back up in here
I rip it up, I put it down when it get mean
2 Chain, Meek Mill with the nicotine
French Montana and Machine Gun Kelly
I ain’t gotta tell you how I act on 16
Gangsta’s don’t dance no more
Pussy ass nigga better stay in his place
How many times you seen one fucking rapper
Kill so many mother fucking rappers with an 8?

(Hook)

[Verse 4: French Montana]
R-R-R-R-Riding with them young boys, rolling up that O-G
Rather have a hothead, then to have some cold feet
Homeboy it's a new day, all my jewels is Blu-Ray
On your wife like Cool J, beat it up like the new Dre
Money here be too grown, fresher than a newborn
They try to sign a whole group, started from the group home
Moving like a boss move, MGK my dog fool
You know I'm a Wild Boy, Cocaine Cowboy

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti]
(Chea)
(Yeah)
Had a show in Cleveland, law shut it down
Dropped that gangsta shit, security couldn't control the crowd
Bitches on that drink, my niggas on that loud
Niggas talking fowl? My pistol talking POW!
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, I'm a dope boy
Top gone (tranparent), where it go boy?
Lamb feta cheese sauce inside broccoli
Got that Machine Gun Kelly and it’s screamin' cock me

[Verse 6: Machine Gun Kelly]
Everybody shut up (shut up)
Couple of them ready to do it different whenever I tell them bitches to come up (come up)
And I ain't talking for the stares, I'm talking for air (gasp) somebody light a blunt up (blunt up)
Call me Steve-O bitch, I put a nutt up to in front of your mother's face like it's nothing
Puff it till' my eyes yellow when I'm with them sun up (What up?)
What I need a shirt fo? What I need a shirt fo?
Tatt'ed up from my head to toe like what I need this shirt fo?
What do I need to work fo? I smack the boss at my job, boy
Fucking hoes like I'm Austin Powers, giving Golden Showers, that's WILD BOY!
(Kellz)

[Hook]

I'm a Wild Boy (repeats)Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm
Oooh-OOOH!

[Hook]
Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with

[Verse 1]
I came here with my dick in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass; be cool
And don't worry bout how I'm ripping this shit
When I'm flipping what I'm kicking nigga, that's just what I do
I'm effervescent and I'm off that crescent
Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; motherfucker keep stepping
They don't fuck with me and they don't
Y'all bitches can't catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix your hair, throw that pussy
Got a Prada for bonapalies, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm tricking? Bitch, I ain't trippin
I'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty
And fuck that coward, girl, you need a real nigga
Off top knick-a-boxers hurting shit
Bend over ho; show me what you workin with!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Attention all y'all players and pimps
Right now in the place to be (shake ya ass)
I thought I told y'all niggas before
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (watch yourself)
Now this ain't for no small booties
No sir cause that won't pass (show me whatcha workin with)
But if you feel you got the biggest one
Then momma come shake ya ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I like my women fire like CAY-ENNE!!
Chocolate and bowlegged - when I'm runnin up behind her!!
Go head do your job, pop the lock, let the cock out
For girl don't lie you know you wanna go back to my house
"The Man Right Chea" wanna get under that dress right there
You spicy cajun we gon' a good time over there
You better suck the head on them there crawfish
And you gotta bend all the way over to dance off this
Handle yo' business but I know you do it way better, you dead wrong
So if you talking bout how niggas make noise when you pass by
Get yo' fine ass on the floor girl this yo' fuckin song!
Do yo' thang dont be scared, cause you gon' get served
You get mine then you gon' get yours
Bout to make yo' ass love it
Raise it up, show the G-string hustling hustling

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Stop yo' cryin heffer, I don't need all that
I got a job for you - the braided up pimp is back
Break them handcuffs, fuck you nigga move something
And if they ask you what you doin say, "Ooohh nuttin!"
And we been doin for the past 2 somethin
And I've been beatin that pussy up not smooth fucking
You can betcha bottom dollar; if that pussy fire
You gon' holla Michael Tyler!
So don't act like you don't be backin that stuff up
Girl in the club, cause that's what you got ass for
Wobble wobble I'm infatuated
Bitch ride a dick like she making a baby
And I see that we gon' have to go to a quiet corner for just us two an'
Don't worry about who looking, just keep on doing what you doing
Cause a nigga like me gon' get to work before I know the girl
Bitch what's happening, let 'em see, show the world!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Uhh.. OOOH-WEE! Good lawd!
Damn![?]

[Intro]
Uh-huh, rain dance
Choking on the loud
Got liquor, plenty to go around
Episodes of Girls Gone Wild
Stevie Stone, Tecca Nina, Mystikal

[Pre-Hook: Stevie Stone]
Said she down with the elites
Drinkin' liquor think she tryna get the bidness
She got her ass to the ceiling
5 chains when there's money in the building

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I don't have to show a rubber band to Pacquiao
Bring it back, got back, splat [?]
On the man, I'm the man still I [?]

Never seen this much money come around
Pocahontas, pokin' that I bit down

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Make it rain, ho x6
Every time I come around then I make her rain dance

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Chock tall, native soil really does this
Rain dance for me, then give me a hug, bwitch
Because I throw hundreds they really want me to shove dwick
All up in 'em, they want that Nina to get in that love pit
Won't deny ya, cause lil mama sympathy
Tie ya right up, 50 shades of whoopin' this
Fire lighter, cause she want us two to get
Higher, higher (HEY) so we do this shit
That's what I do with the strippers
Paid a tip at 'em they coming home with us
We got the killer weed and we got liquor
The simple fact is we the niggas they did us
So it is normal they blowing my skin horn
And they know that they signing the sin form
When the come up in the house of [?]
Been a playa ever since I been born, bitch

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Yikes, I know what she like
Pipe, I be laying it right she said it's
Tight, and she want it with Mike
I finna be bellin' in that pussy, like I'm ridin' a bike
After we leave the strip club my dick gon' be in her
She face down, rear end up
That's just how she'll end up
That what I came in this club for
That what I showin' her all this love for
That what I paid all them tips for
That what I left with this bitch for
She said "gimme some money, and I'll give you some head"
So I gave her some money, she gave me some head
Not that there's much else to be said
I fucked her so good, she came so hard, you woulda thought that she pissing the bed

[Pre-Hook + Hook][Intro - Mystikal]
I'm a political refugee
That's how the fuck I felt

[Hook - Birdman]
Birds for the summer
Hummers for the runners
Candy on the paint
Nine for the thunder
Throw a couple of hundreds
Fishing on the fishtail
With big money, cash money everywhere
High roller, shot caller, big boss
Original, real nigga from the start
Head hunting, price on a nigga tab
Hit ‘em up for playing with a nigga mail

[Mystikal]
Say I’m better than Beethoven
To the beat that I rap over
Stay outta that medicine cabinet
Yeah, that what they told me
Giving us piss tests, cause we stay rolling
And know a nigga act better than a .45 caliber pistol when they loaded
They penalize us, tryna slow us down
They constantly fucking us up
That's why we’re buck wild
Call me porch monkey, call me jigaboo
When you know you wanna fuck my woman and eat my barbecue
How the fuck you wanna watch my house
But don’t wanna live on my street
The ape man taught Tarzan -- how the fuck you better than me?
Rap, I run that rock, and got a jump shot
Who we got that black wife up in that White House
I took my lick and didn’t sell out
I was in the bing, I didn’t bail out
Hoping motherfucker run and fail out
Back to the top from the jail house
Lace ‘em up, tie ya shoe
Catch a cut, you know what pressure do

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Who out chea fucking with me, huh? Tell me that
I’m bout to drop that shit, where my Pamper at?
Try to answer that, or give me my mantle back
I bury you cockroaches, shoulda left me where I was at
You done made that fucking bed
You done built this fucking castle
Buckwheat and his friend Alfalfa
Couldn't do nothing with this little rascal
I wonder licking retarded
Yeah nigga what the hell
Talking baby business, yeah
Yeah bitch, dumb shit
Don’t be fucking with me
Cause you won't get off easy
I feel just like Drew Brees
When they kick off football season
How I cut the ref, you can’t stop from bleeding
Rappers betta leave me alone
If they gon’ keep on breathing
Now keep on starving and I’mma gonna keep on eating
And you keep on sucking, and I’mma keep on skeeting
Nigga, you gon be the one bussing or be the one fleeing
Nigga better keep on trucking
You don't want no fucking trouble this evening

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, ain't it crazy how shit be
Thats why I flush it
I got the Tommy gun with the drum
Thats percussion
I just popped a couple pain pills, self destruction
I made something out of nothing, thanks for nothing
I pistol whip you pussies, knock her out Robitussin
Ran up in your house, killed everybody, no discussion
Rep, that muthafucking red flag like a Russian
Yeah, look, I told her baby I’m a thrasher
We kissed, I lit her ass up than I ashed her
No hard feelings, no card dealing, but I shuffle my queen
Duffle bag too heavy to carry to the car
My Mary in a jar
I’m food, I let the haters add a little salt
Thats cool, I do it for all the niggas that try
And all the bitches I’ve fucked, and all my niggas that died
Tunechi

[Hook][Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah, hell of a day
To load a .22 and take it to the woods and let it ring
Into the night and break a bottle with the bullet
Yes I'm 'bout it motherfucker, not a single solitary thing
Is missin' from my southern roots I'm liable just to take a Chevrolet
And run it through the mud for giggles
Huh, what a son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper
Who could tell story like my uncle when he's drinkin'
Product of a workin' environment, fuck is y'all thinkin'?
Meanin' I'm workin'-workin' harder than any artist
Can ever do it simply cause I'm made that way
I build a house around your ass before you could realize
That you were in the neighborhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it
Tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanna-be, I be that
I'll just take it to the studio
And drop a bomb on you from a motherfuckin' beanbag
I need that..

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Get away, tell my folks roll up the J’s
Bring Yelawolf a deuce, we’ll sit up on the roof of the broken Chevrolet
Talk til there’s nothing left to say
Cause if I don’t get away, you gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways
Then you gon’ have to get away from me
Drink some, smoke some
You gone have to get away from me, load up the guns, load up the guns
Then you’ll have to get away from me
Drink some, smoke some
Cause if I don’t get away, you gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways
Then you gone have to get away from me

[Verse 2: Shawty Fatt]
Man, I done been through it all
I done been up and know what it is to fall
Punk police feeling all on my balls
Without a probable cause, cause a nigga sittin’ tall
"Dawg, you gotta do something Fatt
On the road with Wolf, why did you come back?"
Cause them up there, don’t wanna play fair
Got me pinned to the wall, like a fucking thumb tack. "Dumb fat!"
Dumb hell, criticize a nigga for the crack I sell
Like you could give a shit if a nigga eat well or eat at all, wanna see me fall
Let ‘em see that? Naw dawg, them lies
Only cause I got Catfish on my side
Bitch I'm headed up, up to the sky
Roll up, let's get high
Wavin' them bye, I need that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
20 plus 20 still spittin' 'em out
Still piss on your porch and still shit in your house
Then put my dick in your mouth, take it back out, put it back in
Fuck on the floor, skeet on the couch
Which one of you ugly muthafuckers think you thug enough or rugg enough
Or gutter enough, fast enough to keep up (huh)
The most retarded motherfucker in the whole wide world
Ain’t stupid or dumb enough to fuck with it
If you in say you in, and if you is handle your mutherfuckin’ business
Knuckle up, buckle up, hustle up, huddle up. What we gonna do? Win!
Not a nan’ ‘nother nigga outta there can compare
To what I do to these boys on these bars and these scales
In these clubs in these bars on these tables and chairs
I need that!

[Hook][Mystikal]
Listen!...Listen!...huh...Listen!

God forgive me but you can't do shit no mo'
The water ain't no good, the grass don't grow
Never mention schools ain't safe no mo'
Killing in the 1st grade six years old
Ask yo self this, In what kind of world is that to raise yo children
Then again it really don't matter, where you gone go
You still gotta live it
Let's face reality, stop talking bout peace that's a thing of the past
But then again that's a bald face lie
Cause a few years ago you was hanging my ass
??? no presidents, sometimes the whole world just pressed up against me
Think about it, young black man, come up set up for penitentary
Do the math, all on you, choose yo path,be a leader, pray for strength
Know when to cap and when to blast
Get back on track, we damn near got past crack, then every dope dealer got
Snatched back
But we already black on black, that's sad
Is it really in our nature what make it so bad
But I ain't no better then the rest of ya'll
Plus I came up in a house wit out no dad
I knew that you left, you didn't won't to
But that how it is, Lord help us, You know what we going through

Hook:

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

[Mystikal]
Somebody tell me what you get in a relationship
With nothing but silence, silence
We ain't married so we can't get divorced
So the only thing left is domesticated violence
When a man uses a woman to take out his problems
He abuses that woman, then man must recognize this and stop it
We got two kids and you pregnant again so how can we profit
That's BULLSHIT! That ain't no reason to pull her arm out the socket
Baby I'm so sorry, you know that I luv you and didn't wanna hurt you
When I put my hands on ya, I was wrong so I don't deserve ya
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be a witness when they describe a nigga on the t.v
Now my sister flipping in the grave
Cause that's a how she died and I know this can't be me
Lord help her forgive me, God give me my purpose
Jesus break this chains, you know this a viscous circle
But I got my trust in you
I know there will be light at the end of the tunnel
I done been in many situations, she was there each and everyone of 'em
Keep me humble
I wanna take time out write down and thank ya, thank ya
Trying to make it wit out you is something we can't do

Hook:

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get us together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

[Mystikal]
Lord tell them you difference
Between having eternal life or forever burn, burn
Lord tell em you was wit me when I had my accident
And my truck started flipping and turnin'
When it felt like I was dying from the moment of impact
We rolled ten times
I was driving my best, that fool came on my side of the line
But when the truck did finally stop moving I was just fine
My little brother that was on the passenger must of got hurt
Cause he was unconscious
We done had our tradegy's
We was just talking so this can't be happenin'
But before I could say anything else
I saw the helicopter and the ambulance
My little brother came back through, first thing he said was
"What is going on"
But the next thing he said was
"Watch over me lord and keep me strong"
And right then and there, I knew every thing was gone be alright
But we ain't promised nothing
So thank you my lord for saving his life

Hook: 2x until fade

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow[Hook] (8X)
It's all that I know

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Shit, what I do?
The bitches shuffle to the front when I come
Clap your hand & stomp your foot to the rhyme cougar
Roll the die hit the blunt
Listen to the rhythm of the rapper, ass whooper
I click-clack like a gat, spitter
Broke up with my rap, but I'm back with her
Don't fuck with my greens or
You don't want the Hulk to get mad nigga?!
Nigga, nigga, with a motherfucking man right here
Nigga nigga put his foot in your shit, or
Make a nigga slap in your ass, kisser
Let that nigga do the little song
Write it to the music, feel it work it
Soon as Trae e-mail me the beat
I'mma take it to the booth and I'mma kill it, murk it
Curse it, bless it, church it, cash it, change it, purse it
Tell them niggas that I'm back on the block
And I got them killer verses
Tell 'em to sell 'em the one for ten
I'd let them go, two for five
Either way, I'mma get that ten
Or you want none of these rhymes
Long as I murder these shows and hurdle these hoes
Shorty don't go and I don't have to be working that lows
I rock jewelry that glows with a rap name, twenty years old
Shit, what else can I say? Fuck, that's all that I know!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae]
I am the street king, took a minute to lock shit
My image is a gun play, you ain't gon' block shit
Overdose in my hand, tell 'em I can't feel 'em
Diamonds all over my fingers, that be on Ciroc shit
I been livin' all player, ever since shit off
Haters on my dick, like women, they'd better get off
You can find me in the gutter, scared of heights
Sitting on a couple of mil, money tall I'm trying to get off
Clique like brothers, tell 'em to give 'em the blues
Recievin' the call of competition I won't lose
I'm a fool, when I lace these shoes with these tools
Leavin' niggers abused, of something off in the crew
Speakin' of crews, tell me what's on that new
Used to kick it one thing, now hoes come in the two's
When I'm finna black murder, should have been on the news
Shoot 'em in they face, and leave 'em with no clues
Go up to the boulevard walkin' in all glass
Tell the bank-teller person I'll count it in all cash
Everybody be talkin' but I'mma pull up and show 'em somethin'
And go to wreckin' shit like I been in a bad crash
In the hood, I'm access for real
Ask Eazy, he'll tell you that I was Trill
Million dollar mouthpiece, one hell of a grill
I thug Universal, don't sweat it I got a deal
Anybody wanna' run up I'll tell 'em I'm in this bitch
If a hater got a problem I'm probably up in his bitch
You all want truth, you gon' find him up in a ditch
I'll bang his ass up like tracks when I'm makin' hits
You can tell 'em I'm sick, rare form of cancer
I am the truth, I guarantee you the answer
Anybody who lookin' tell 'em to look no more
If I don't get the proper respect, I'm kickin' they door

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I be in the corner with the bitches
Off in the club I be grantin' many wishes
All the haters be super suspicious
As to why they sniffin' I make super digits
Makin' beautiful music and then a bita'
Aphrodisiac to get bitches to swoon
But I catch 'em quick with these incredible tunes
Me stickin' poon will be inevitable soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, I'll be laughin' at these busters
Think they smashin' and we suckers
But we blastin' at these fuckers
Trippin' over colours you niggas you gotta love us
No matter the set I'mma get up and rip 'em into pieces
He's beneath me and needs to be treated
Like a fleet with a beast and believe he's heated
Because of my talent they mad
And I'm never gonna challenge their ass
Cause my balance for nada pay cash
You suckers down there but my wallet's ain't bad
Motherfucker like Sam-U-el L
You perpetrators I'mma damn you to hell
Your bitches love to hear this animal yell
Try to beat me, understand you will fail
In control of all of my dough
Now it's off to the mall I go
You the money really tall I show
If you really wanna brawl I know
That you niggas gonna fall to my toes
I be killin' all of y'all when I blow
Cause a nigga comin' raw when I flow is all that I know

[Hook]-If we was owned by the white folks it will be all good
-But we independent, black owned and making scrilla
-We a threat to society
-They ban our movies our videos, but we still #1 in America
-You see a coward can talk shit behind a nigga back
-But only a man can tell you what's on his mind
When he look you in the eyes
-In other words, don't judge a book by its cover
-See we successful black businessmen
But we also mercenary soldiers

(Chorus)

Always look a man in the eyes before you kill him
Even if he's a coward or a motherfucking drug dealer
(My pops say)

Verse 1 (Master P)

I sell stones out, I'm breaking them got damn phones up
Niggas they popping them keys, Master P he fucking ??
Besides them g's, I'm ?? them keys but they didn't know
That I could go gold
Platinum and still slang keys out the record store
This caine got me sick
These niggas they talking that shit
Don't make me load this M16 and split your fucking shit
I caught the game from some old g's
Niggas they slanging they fucking keys
Got the game from New Orleans
Now the world know of me
I'm down south hustling from the west
To the east, in the midwest yeah ya'll niggas know of me
Trying to slang this ghetto dope to the world
Every woman, man and boy wrap these cd's up like furls
On the corner posted up with them ballers
Slanging that yella, niggas ya'll can't hold us
Gone for 15/5 when you see me its no drought
I'm the nigga on the corner with the fucking gold in my mouth
Got every fucking club bout it bout it
Got every nigga that you see rowdy rowdy
Cause I'm down here hustling putting the ghetto on the map
Independent, black owned and ain't scared to bust no caps

(Chorus x3)

Verse 2 (Mystikal)

Nigga tell me what you gone do
Its just me and you, you and I
Scrap and scuffle then grab them things mano a mano
If we did the mix
Flury gone smother it leave your ass studdering
Fludging
Tell your fucking boys don't move
Cause like a rug I got them covered
Niggas ain't like they used to be
Back in the days they were playing the dozens
These days niggas will kill ya
Talking shit, say it to the end of my muzzle
We don't want no trouble, black just as subtle
Tell you what you gone fuck around and find
If you disrespect my hustle
None of you niggas fuckers, young niggas fuckable
Some niggas ??, dumb niggas suffer
Before you can even think about making a move I'm already on it
I'll have to beat your ass to the punch cause the stong survive only
Hold on bitch this shit bout to hit the ceiling
The interference started from the ground up the building
Behind mine's I just don't give a fuck
Ain't no closing my eyes
I'm gone look in your face and tear your ass up

(Chorus x3)

Verse 3 (Silkk)

Aaahh its murder
Do or die, killed or be killed
Nigga who am I
Silkk the Shocker, do or die for a mil
Don't you see I be counting money like a machine
No how I'm saying I got to buy my green
For every fiend equals money like ching ching
My dream, know what I'm saying, got to get the cream or triple beam
By it for 15/5 and I sell it for 18
You know what I'm saying, you know what a nigga like known for
Nigga kill himself before he caught the bad one
You know what we known for
And its all good in the hood, but I still stay strapped
Keep my hands on my 45 cause these days niggas will try to straight jack
And you know how I'm saying, 4 g's and I run it
Never seen a nigga retire from the dope game, until I done it
And its cool I gotta reach eight digits
Any nigga in my way I gots to kill him
Got a look a man in the eye before you drill him

(Chorus)[Hook: Detail]
Talk to me baby, tell me who I am
Tell my nigga I said what's up, when you get a chance
Tell my bitch I said what's up, when you get a chance
She said when can you do it, we can do it when you can
Girl I'm all about the angels
Come down from heaven, you angel
Pop that pussy every angle
I swear I love my angel, my angel

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
You might not believe me, think that I'm trippin', but nigga I saw angel
I did, I did, that chick was thick, I mean she was off the chain
I wasn't stalkin' but couldn't stop lookin', like she called my name
Maybe if I get her attention she might notice I'm fly like I'm off the plane
I'm making my move, you know what I mean
It ought be sacrilegious, to look like them religious jeans
Blame her mother, but don't tell her dad
His chid gotta heavenly body, but one hell of an ass

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Hold up, wait a minute
Let me put some Millzy in it
Ain't no hands inside her body, but I bet she feel me in it
That bedroom in danger when we desoliving anger
I work her ass out so good she got rid of her trainer
Talk to me, bad bitches they honk to me
GTV-shot non-stop now watch that pussy walk to me
Fuck 'em all girl, we gon' make them sweat
Our top down and it ain't even at weather yet, so

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Okay now do me like a favour, or do me like a chore
Or do me in your favourite red bottoms, oh Lord
I say my guardian angel, I swear her features a blessin'
She gon' learn today, I taught that pussy a lesson
I beat that up like I just made hell, kiss that pussy whenever do tell
Give her that package, you got mail
When it kind of your love I'll take that (?)
I'm lookin' for you girl, and do shit a molly world
I want a rotten fish, old Tuna spoil you girl

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
She makes that ass clap, like a naughty girl
Introduce you to some better things I can show you girl
Lights on, but take that Prada off, I beat it like a xylophone
No phones, but I can be the one that you're calling on
Talk to me baby, walk with me baby
Then we can take a long ride in this charcoal Mercedes
I'm the boss you my lady
You keep it wet, I go underwater swimming
I be a shark for you baby

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
Man I got pussy from my angel, head from my angel
I spent a night in heaven, me and Elvis split a Mango
She had that aquafina mermaid wet wet
I heard the love gods hollerin' out, "Man, we got next"
Her physique is unique like the clothes from boutique
Hit that ass 'til she peak and can't speak
She got wings on that pussy, she's so fucking fly
And everybody say she's dope, but this another high

[Verse 6: Birdman]
Talk to me baby my lady and my friend too
Notice flower bomb the scent when she breeze through
Bitches hatin' cause we sitting on top
When you walk the block the traffic stop
The 2-seater that I copped, that's for me and you
Drop the top back, your hair breezing through
I lay my stunt down proper, top shotter original (?)

If you dont know by now then Ill doubt you'll ever know
So let me try and educate you with my Lyrical flow
On the Mic at this time, in the place to be
People hanging out just coz they wanna be next to me
Its a special place let me try to explain
Its not a record shop or a fast food chain
When my cupbpards are bare and Im not Hip Hopping
You'll see me down there, doing my shopping

If you dont know where it is go to microcare computing
Just round the corner from Acorn Recruiting
Sanitary prtotection, Magazines or a twix
Theres some bloke on the door who looks like Neo from the matrix

Balls
Homemade sandwiches and homemade pies
You get served after hours if you give them the eyes

P.Xain
Well dont try shoplifting and dont go nicking
The last person that did got a proper fucking kicking

Eggsy
Loads of wicked people utilise the store
One bloke did try to start a fight before
But he wasn't affiliated with the friendly staff
Coz he was rough the sort of person who would shit in the bath

Adam Hussain
Pasties, Sarnies and Polish meats
Extra strength Lager to drink on the street
I even hang round outside when its closed
Take my Mrs down there when Im gonna propose

They sell sex lube, Scratch Cards and Choc Ices
All that and more at reasonable prices

Its a local shop but its so much more
Ilove going down there when I smoke the draw

8 Baneswell Rd is the Address[Verse 1: Jaybird the Purdy Boi]
Never thought I'd be rappin' on the cypher, this a blessin'
Never thought I'd be rappin' for Premier, this cat's a legend
Never thought I'd get picked out the whole country by Khaled
To rap on BET, guess he saw me as the best man
619 to 858 to 760 I'm reppin'
San Diego to all you foreign, Daygo's what we call it
Shout out to all the haters watchin' this
Eat a plate of blue waffle disease
Drink some water with some AIDS mix
I got lines that Holly hookers wanna sniff
Flow is poetic justice, make Janet recite the lyrics I spit
Who hotter than me? You hotter than who?
All Eyez On Me, I'm way 2Pac-er than you
Man I murder beats for a living, I murder the competition
Celebrate it, dancin' like Serena at the olympics
Y'all put me on national TV, thinkin' I wouldn't show out?
Man I'mma take over like Jay-Z, I'mma rock out

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Grab your Slurpee and popcorn, I'm bout to make it hot for 'em
They didn't even invite me to this shit, man I just walked on
If I didn't come, then every bit of hope for rap is all gone
I'm ill, in the past you thought I wasn't, but you thought wrong
"Hop I lost respect for you, I'm pissed and you just lost a fan
All you do is diss, I'll never bump your album "Raw" again"
If what I say gets on your last nerve, then holla man
But truth is, y'all can't touch me like Pac's hologram
Don't dare to try it if you scared of dyin'
I'm terrifyin', the real Boogie Man, who even got your parents hidin'
When you're sleeping, I'll find your window, and just stare inside it
I'm a animal, momma raised me inside a lair with lions
Prepare for violence, Funk Volume's an unfair alliance
We embarrass giants, and rip mic's till we get laryngitis
My wave's sitting like a sandstorm, and I know what you mad for
Cause I'm living my dream, and yours

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Dropped out of school and became richer
Retired from the pliers, kept balling like I'm a clipper
Black hoodies, black bitches and black Benzes
She know these chains fit, so now she want my forensics
Got love for my city, shout out to Kendrick
October 22nd, the album, so go and get it
Look, turn a good kid to wig city, I serve plenty
Shoot til the chamber and clip empty, that's real crippy
Have a shirt, and my knuckles smothered with hate powder
Die and go to hell, and have the devil getting higher
How ironic that we smoking fire, gangsta rap Messiah
Mid-20's but 20 racks an hour
Bucket hats and designer beans, the Bosselini
Young slimmy, your chance see me?, your chance skinny
(?) placed rappers get paid pennies
A million off of tour this year because of all this talk about Romney
Iffy, Puffy

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
My flow is captivating, Magic Chick is watching this and masturbating
Basket cases, spitting in yo picnic, better pack a lunch
Chop 'em down, bag 'em up, Bill Murray, Daffy Duck
Yeah my squad the illest, y'all a little fishy, halibut
Chickens acting ratchet get split open with this hatchet
We the kids that causing racket with that automatic riot shit
Irises is violent, air balloon, we high as heck
Play the violin, fucking models wearing Iverson's
This my moment, don't blow it like my old chick
You the type to still tuck your shirt behind your phone clip
Whoa, and I think I might need a lawyer
Hov bout to have me killed for trying to talk to Rita Ora
I'm sorry that's just extra there
I'm going crazy like Clint Eastwood iat the empty chair
Keep your eyes peeled, running through a mine field
Even Lord Finesse will tell you I'm ill

[Verse 5: Mystikal]
Mystikal flex your style on em, transform and get wild on em
Growl at em, "Rah"
Trukfit nigga you a monster, you out the attic
Yeah scare a nigga, "Rah"
I sit your stupid ass down wherever on the side
Let a real nigga back in this bitch, get it live
Off of that performance, y'all might consider a different job
That ain't gon' cut it partna, at least you tried
How many niggas can't spell live cause they tired?
Some of them think that they the shit but they not
Move to the Shakers, make it happen when they pound
Hustles out to get it bustin', layin' on they side
Big Truck, Cash Money rapping Baboon
Ya auntie and ya momma know bout that (?) fool
Your grandpa and your grandma heard that (?) rule
White boys and white girls gon' buy that (?)Chorus:

<lots of noises by Mystikal>

First Verse:

BEWARE!
The man with the braids done walked in
Mild mannered like Clark Kent
I'M rougher and tougher than dead shark skin
This man gonna be have you flippin' like the pages of (???)
Evil like Cruella
Five minutes later I'ma still be hard as an armadillo
Roll like an eighteen wheeler
Shinin' like the slipper
Of Cinderella
And bad weather
And acapella
THIS FELLA
TOP SELLER!!!!
Gonna be that way til' I'm old as Mandela
STILL GETTIN' BETTER!!!!!
Writin' rhymes I'm best of 'em
I'm the arrester, I'm the professor
I'm the nigga that keep his picture on your girlfriend's dresser
Now really
Tell me what you muthafuckas know about gettin' ROWDY
Tell your whole Sunday gang bout it
BITCH I BEEN BOUT IT!!!!!
Now, I kick the rest of you into HASH
BOW GRASSHOPPER, BOW TO THE MAN!!!!!!!

Chorus

Second Verse:

AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Bet'cha runnin'
I bet'cha, bet'cha I'm best that I'm better
Run with a letter
Swift as a jet or keep up with the pace setter
Sparkle like glitter
HARD HITTER
HOE GO-GETTER
SIDE STEPPIN' FROM NO NIGGA!!!!!!
Whenever you bitches decide you gonna get too big for your britches
Leavin' you stitches
Diggin' ditches
Sufferin' hickeys, cuts, scrapes, bruises, welts
Don't fuck with the RHYMIN' BLACK BELT
WATCH YOURSELF!!!!!!!
BOOM!!!!! HERE I GO!!!!!!!
BOOM BOOM!!!!!!!!  I KNOW!!!!!!!
Y'all niggas can't fuck with the man with two tongues, cuz that's the way I flow
Cuz I can get hot like fire
And you can't put it out, it's like tip-toein' on top of barbed wire
For instance, persistance
No resistance, stay your distance
Is vital to your existance
You leave it to me to show you the way out
I'm never gonna play ya
I'LL TAKE YOUR OLD LADY
EVEN IF I TOOK MY BRAIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDS OUT!!!!!!!!!

Chorus

Third Verse:

And I'm uh, ready, and it looks like ALL you bitches are rusty
Y'all can't buss me, don't cuss me
Hit'cha, so much muthafuckin' we gone leave this bitch musty
You disgust me
Trust me
When Mystikal hits the door, you bitches be SCREAMIN' to touch me
I'm the invisible man you can't see me
I'm mackin' illusions and confusion
I'm abusin', your conclusion, and contusions, from the bruises
Issuin' these muthafuckas with the style that them bitches want
FIVE FOOT ELEVEN, screamin' to heaven
I say FUCK SHIT GOD DAMN
Bitch respect me like a reverend, and...
Congregation say "Amen"
(Amen)
Come through this muthafucka swingin' like a CAAAAVEEMAAAN
And you against me, you better not say it go back in the water
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come
UP JUMP THE SHIT STORM!!!!!!
From the rats
Rollin' out
Since you wanna BOW muthafucka
BOW to the master!

Chorus[Mystikal]
Whaaa, wassup nigga?
This for my niggas in them Big Trucks
This for all my niggas in them SUV's, you heard me?
This for my Big Truck Drivers, look nigga blow yo' Big Truck Horn
You still could see me in my Big Truck boy
Smilin' like a lil' kid when I spin the corner with my brand new toy
I got 'em parkin they cars, talkin 'bout
They wish I never would've came out the garage
But, I guess that's too bad
Cause your truck used to be the shit until they saw mine pass
Strobe lights flash, solar baric *boom boom*
Big feet ten runnin' while they *vroom vroom*
Another SUV can't do nothin' wit' me
I'm 23's so 22's ain't fuckin' with me
Car so big it make it hard to turn the wheel
I can't watch the T.V.'s from the sturrin-wheel
Shit, plush stronger than the buckskin ceiling
Chocolate tan interior really big truck grill
Yeah, that's how you do that there
Got bling and bass, everything clean but the ash-tray

[Hook: Byou2ful] (Mystikal)
I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song (I'm a Big Truck Driver)
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome (I'm a Big Truck Driver)
And you know when you pass those small trucks you doin' them wrong
(This is for my riders Big Truck Drivers
Even on a bad day everything clean but the ash-tray)

[Mystika]
Dark lights with brights, the dark windows
With the pistols in the hot spots fuckin' well right
So when you bitches try to act hype
I get the gat get the gat cause niggas don't fight
When you get to Ruby Tuesday's then make a right at the light
And you might catch my rims will-millin' 'round night light
I played a Jag' 'round rags, and now Excursion and Escalade 'round upscale
The Range Rove's don't even get used
Til it's time for Rhythm City or either House of Blues
My niggas wit' me at your seat to pick my friends up
My brother Reece in a motherfuckin Benz truck
Fresh light don't need no buffin'
Just call a homie where I'm at, west coast custom
Put it on a trailer and ain't no rushin'
Cause when I get it back y'all ride can't touch it

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Ain't no slack in my mack, rollin' slow the windows down
They recognize me so you know how they act
Cuttin' up fallin' out tryin' to flirt and get nasty
Raisin' shirt showin' titties talkin' 'bout autohgraphs
I try my best to keep my fans happy
I sign my name I grab the nipple they pull off and start laughin'
Then it's back through the hood, tryin' to find somethin' good
And after that I'm on my way to Baton Rouge
I knew that I'm on course at all time
And I love grindin' like alcoholics love sweet creamy and wine
2002 and you dodgin' me now
Big Truck gonna come up ain't no holdin' us down
Grab eyes, turn heads, stop traffic
My black Big Truck half match my Big Truck jacket
Do shows and get paid when I travel stay busy it be gone
Now this a Big Truck Driver

[Hook 2x]

[Mystikal]
I'm a Big Truck Driver, I'm a Big Truck Driver
This is for my riders Big Truck Drivers
Even on a bad day everything clean but the ash-tray(Intro [Master P])
What's up niggas and bitches
It's the muthafuckin kisarme
It's No Limit, Master P
Im'a introduce y'all to the muthafuckin
One of the hardest liuetenants on the tank, Mystikal
We was all born to be soldiers
See, these evil thoughts
They was scarred into our muthafuckin souls from these wars
The streets, the ghetto, the hood. The ghetto

Chorus: X 7

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!
[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Mystikal]
Ah, ATTEN!
Hoo! Muthafuckas don't you move
I got what is takes to make your ass feel (?)
You don't wanna rest in this parade
No Limit soldiers throwin grenades!
Strictly, heavy artillery, calm and gunnin
I got your ground troops runnin from INCOMING!
Go, go go go, the future caliber
Bout to rip your (?) vest, split your capita
The niggas be marchin in the land camp
Bitch we ghetto soldiers, the streets is what made us!
No LVE's, no MRE's
But we kill our enemies, and drive humvees!

Chorus X 5

[Master P]
Born, to be, a muthafuckin soldier
The colonel don't play, I'm out that tank
Money in the bank, make niggas think
At ease when we rank, salute cause we cap
Fools run they trap, soldiers bust caps
Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once
Put that on my gold keys, my gat, and my blunt
Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's
We bout it, eyes hella red gone off green cause we rowdy
Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages
Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character
I'm ready to bust keys, niggas (?)
Niggas are fuckin, slanging them trees
They gon die in New Orleans

Chorus X 4

[Silkk]
I came out the muthafuckin womb, niggas wanna combat tank
My ghetto antics, my ghetto tactics
I smack quick, stick another gat nigga to your ass and acrobatic
Nigga what? Black, my M-16, is black bitch
I was born to drop phat shit
Punk your ass like a sac bitch
Yeah, I keep a gat bitch (?) I react quick
Blow them soldiers, told ya, and that's it
But see, I set my shit off like a punt (Go, T, Go)
We roll, I said we roll like a muthafuckin blunt
See, don't come stunt and don't try to front
I'm Silkk the Shocker, I snatch your ass like a muthafuckin duck
I put on my camoflauge nigga, straight up my fuckin boot
Why would a muthafucka who ain't TRU laugh at old shoot
About face, salute!
Tell I'mma soldier, by the way I talk
Tell I'mma soldier, by the way I march (Right, left, left)
I was born to be a soldier!

Chorus X 4

[Fiend]
Bringin bags and weed
Lil Fiend live by the soldiers creed
Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues
War fatigues, playing live chess games with the chain
(?) at the gun range, cause I'll bring pain
When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest
But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest
I was best on my recon, started harm and dis
The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this
Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide
Cause the crime design, stay from nine to five
Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up
No Limit soldiers, the world blow up!

Chorus X 3

[Mac]
Assassin, soldier, sniper, murderer
Son of a bitch, arsonist, house burglarer
Been there, done most before the sun rose
We changin clothes, when the po po's chase
Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face
And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways
And even when I'm dead and gone
My legacy'll live on
Tatoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on
Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit
For lunatics who be feelin this shit
Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real
Pops gave me the game, bout to bag a feel
We attack like the Men in Black
You react, if you got a gat
I'll never die, camoflauge in my vein
I'll never change in the purple rain
My name manifest pain, I'm a soldier

Chorus X 8[Hook 2X: Mystikal] + (Pharrell)
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me... trust me
(You ain't seen bouncin' back)

[Verse 1]
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than batman and robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling they business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
I know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep your chin up
Cause sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No matter what happened that's only once it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then it's shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble we didn't want learn or
Sometimes we be getting in trouble we ain't gon' see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take 'em in stride and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody said fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happin'
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life will be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You heard about me, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you changed ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complainin' and forgot what you was cryin' bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And real as ever so I hope you proud of me

[Hook]

[Repeat to fade]
You keep bumping me against the wall (*3X*)
(You ain't seen bouncin' back)[Mystikal]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

[Pharrell]
You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

[Mystikal]
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
Know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up
And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

[Hook]

No matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then its shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn
Sometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping

Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happin'
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life a be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

[Hook]

Oh you heard about it, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And when its over and done with I hope you proud of me

[Hook]

(repeat and fade out)[Hook: Mystikal]
Nigga that's that bullshit, nigga that's that bullshit

They got me fucked up, right now on that bullshit

[Verse 1]
Same nigga hump the beat like a pussy
Fuckin' right I put the dick on the track
Same nigga he just got outta jail
Same nigga that's 'bout to go back
So what the rapper got 90 more days?
Should have never hit that bitch in the head
I know she pushed you and you probably felt played
Better next time you gonna walk yo ass away
Get yo shit together, nigga get yo mind right
Every nigga in here smarter than Albert Einstein lookin' at it from hindsight
Hope this shit starts sankin in before it's a cell you be stankin in
No bitches, no titties, no pussy prints tell my why the fuck you wasn't thinkin' then
I said, "uhhh." The judge say, "'Uhhh' my ass!"
Tell yo people how much that you miss 'em and you love 'em talkin to 'em from behind that glass
Hello Canteen Line, I plan about five racks
Lemme get that in coffee and hygiene, stamps and bugler packs
You're mad cause I'm movin' fast, so you're usin' that
Now you're out here talkin' shit, but bitch I'm used to that
Bitch, I never give up. I said I'll never go back
But judgin' from the way the ball done bounce, I might get to see my nigga Mack

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Tryna do me like a low-down dog. Treat me like a hen pecked freak
A mother like a one legged gimp. Or something like a four-eyed geek
Cause you up in there huffin' and puffin talkin' 'bout I lie and cheat
Bitch I want you outta my house, She said I want you off these streets
Damn! Hold up, sorry baby. Ain't gotta be all that
You know how much I love you. Don't do nothin' crazy
Yo man, you you ain't gettin to no panties, you might as well pack yo bags
And of course standing next the DEA, my brother can't you hear me like kiss my ass
Say goodbye to those shows, and peace out to those beats
Tell 'em how I got you out the truck, yeah nigga hand over those keys
There you go, take it baby. It's yours darling
Turn the motherfucker sideways, stuff that bitch where you sit on the toilet
'scuse me speakin' in tongues. But she forgot about the Charger
I know that she know nothin' bout the charger
Now that bitch got me facin charges
I guess it go like that, and it be like that
Momma said knock that lightweight out, 81 days you gon be right back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bitch you tryin' to swing below the belt, ho you tryin' to hit behind the knee
If this were Silence of The Lambs, our troubles would be over. Popo Clarice
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Fly, fly, fly
I repent if you think that this is gonna be the end of me bitch you's a goddamn lie
Hey there mike mike mike man, now that you're my my my
Seen Daddy get off probation, when the restraining come off, I'd love to see y'all come by
Daddy gotta go through the joint just to get to the door
Daddy gotta climb over these hoes just to make it back home to the toil
Now we know that big girls don't pout, and big boys don't cry
Y'all better not fight in this bitch and cry, y'all play nice
Do just as I say, but not as I do
In the house, you start fuckin' up, guess what? I'll whoop your lil bad ass too[Intro]
You know what time it is, nigga
And you know who the fuck this is
Danger, danger; get on the floor
The nigga right chea; sing it

[Hook]
Been so long, (sing it)
Since he's been on, (sing it)
So please, (get on the floor)
Show me, (the nigga right chea)
What it is that you want to see

[Verse 1]
Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keeping you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Taking they shirt off, showing they tattoos
Screaming and hollering and all
Got the gift to come up with it
Put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on
Sharp like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad like that student in the principal office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damnedest lyrical marvel you come across often
So watch yourself
Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know
Go head though, bounce them titties
Shake that ass, drop that pussy but stay in line ho
Fuck I can't, cause you can can
Cocked up, head down, pussy popping on a handstand
Leave that pussy smoking
If you gon' do something then bend over, and bust that pussy open

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My fucking concert line around the corner
Parking cars, niggas looking for they bitch, nothing on her
You looking good momma; why, pssh what's up homie
Sirens, limousines, and the club owner ya bitch you
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch cause it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough
I'm backstage bouncing, adrenaline building up
The pussy cutter, did I stutter
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit then, bitch that's what it is

[Hook]

[Outro]
Danger, talking bout
Danger, motherfucker look
Get on the flo'
The nigga right chea
Danger, motherfucker, watch your back
Danger, look look
Nigga what, look look
Get on the flo'
The nigga right chea, get 'em up

[Verse 3]
I wanna see these fake rappers get off the mic
Gimme my room, you grabbed my space
Look out you all in my life, watch out man
I'm ripping a solo, I jump in the show, the rest are no more
Threw lyrical bolos, head butts and rhyme elbows
Get off me; tip-toe, wild slow, wild softly
Hurry up, you might not be able to do that shortly
Ain't trying to forget the chea
The whole crowd screaming out danger, danger

[Hook][Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I really hope when you hear this song
That you're happy with somebody new (happy, na, na, na, na)
Baby because I am the love I can call my own
And I know I'm apart from you

[Bridge][x4]
[Mystikal]
We can't stop now
We can't stop
You can't stop
So [bitch] don't try

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Don't you know that you seem
Just a little crazy
And I trust in intimacy
But you threw it away
Just threw it away
Now that's all in the past
When I think of you I just laugh
My friends must of thought I was high
Cause I given so much to someone not worth my time

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do
Did I do that?
You rhapsodize
You get caught up in the high
Till your senses return to you
Love played you for a fool

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
You were so insecure
And your crew was so immature
Conversations getting weak
It was much better off when we didn't speak
But gotta tell you the truth
It was my illusion of you
Being so how destined for me
It had me in a daze
But, when I was seeing you

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey]
I really hope when you heat this song
That you know it was meant for you (you, you, you, you)
Know you're the one to ride alone
Try to do the best you can do

[Bridge]
W/ adlibs from Mariah Carey (x4)

Lately I can't seem to stay outside of her!
We Can't stop talking on the phone, I let her jump My bones
Ooh she let Me see her model in a thong
But all of a sudden, life 's been changing!
You've been trying to dog Me, shine on Me, Walk over Me!
All this time you was being Phoney?
I was down for you down for dollar signs only
How could you do a brother that?
After all I do for you and yours this is how you pay me back?

Yeah, Bigga Than Life
YMCMB, flashy life style
[?] up on my headphones, my nigga
And my ones up

[Hook: Birdman]
Hustle in the morning, smokin' in the clouds
Bitches come in dumpin' cause they ran a hundred miles
Rain still pourin', the bottles lift up
Stuntin' on them bitches and the whips flamed up
The sun do shine, Christmas every day
Them holidays comin', so you know we quit the spray
Muscle is a must, the money in the can
Strapped every day, we still hustle in the sand

[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
Uh, holla holla
Hehe, go
I'm a need a mountain of money
A mountain that amount the amounts to a mountain of money
Ride out with my dunny, fresh up out your mommy
Shout to the tummy - eat, sleep, shit on my toes
Bust a bitch in her nose cause they mouth so runny
Back to the money, Dada
Give a nigga bread like "bless you" (thank you) nada
I'm been on the block from the top tryna plot on a spot
Now I'm game with it - ta da!
Fuck around, I'll bang with the sawed-off
Fuck around, rob these niggas, do my thing like "voila"
Ain't nothin' changed but the dollars
Niggas so lame cause they ain't gon' claim i'm they father
Fuck it
I'm one of the niggas that don't fold
Treat me like one of them niggas that don't rap
Spinning 'em like a Tommy, automatic my laddy
I've been known to get niggas in one "blap!"
When I trip up, it's foreign - when I grip up, it's foreign
When I fuck, bitch foreign
Pull on my Trukfit foregin...
Pull on my Trukfit foregin...
I don't trust these hoes

[Hook: Birdman]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Every single morning that a nigga get out of bed
Know a nigga gotta get it
Money to burn, raw OG Kush in a $100 bill, smoke weed with it
Why y'all niggas wanna whip shit with it?
Mulssane, I ain't gotta put a key in it
True don, make me wanna whip in it
Different money - add another didget
Get this money then I slide and I'm gone
Y'all already know who's side that I'm on
YMCMB, lil' nigga - Rich Gang, everything far from the norm
From the jails to the college campus, we've got 'em yellin' in the dorms
We try to compete 'til they go bankrupt, and we're just gettin' warm
If you ain't know, motherfucker, you can take another look, nigga
Whole team strong...
And we knock every spot on the charts
Every time a nigga drop each song
I don't need to tell 'em, they already know what it is
We run every city and we runnin' every block, nigga
Respect this conglomerate, bitch, cause you can't reach the number one spot

[Hook: Birdman]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Yup, i quit that bitch, don't look at my bucks
And i'm about that sell, pop back on that bus
Nah man, fuck them hoes, i won my O's
Bitch, I gotta go, let's roll back on the show
She bad, we see ya, another nigga can't beat her
In the [?] then back to the streets
Bitch, it's a habit to fuck it with Weezy
Thank god for Tunechi, Lord bless stunna
Hallejulah, Cash Money, i was going under
Tryna fuck my [?], and i do my Ana
And i ain't talking 'bout [?]
Bitch, [?] nigga as my mama
But, we are tha business
That's all they seeing
You cannot fuck with them
Go ask my nigga Slim

[Hook: Birdman][Bruno Mars]
Ladies and gentleman, give it up for Mystikal

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Calling all cars in here for the Prince of the South
Fuck that yabba-dabba-doo shit, bitch, I just got out
Still rapping, slapping kittens and grabbing my cock
I'm the artist, the godfather, still hard as a rock
You gon fuck around and make me knock your fruit juice loose
Banana, your watermelon and pomegranate too
Rhyming kung-fu that split bamboo
Crowd rockin', ain't no stopping that rapping ass fool
I been bad, bro, 'cha getting mad for?
I'm gon' have to fuck you up
I eat flames up
Shit fire out
Don't make me light my butt
Excuse me, who me?
I got a lot of groupies
Oughta have a fucking doghouse like Snoopy
Curtains go up
It's going down
Tear the thing out the frame
Like my band

Come on, come on

[Chorus]
Feel right in this motherfucker
(Right)
Feel good in this motherfucker
(Right)
My whole hood in this motherfucker
(Right)
And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
X2

And we gon' rock this motherfucker
(All night)
X2

[Bruno Mars]
Mystikal, don't hurt 'em now

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Grabbing at my pants, she trying to pull it out my pocket
Don't yank on the motherfucker so hard, you're gonna pull it out the socket
It's exercise with thighs and hip muscles
Next exercise, we gon' burn some lip muscles
Let the music work your ear muscles
And if you're skinny then use your little muscles
Bag back or tea bag with these duffles
Pow pow get smash when we hustle
When the last time you have a knuckle sandwich, huh?
The last time a nigga had a foot so far up your ass you couldn't handle it?
You can't stand it
To make matters worse you gotta go to the studio with Bruno Mars on another planet
Don't get mad, I'm just saying
Don't believe it cause I'm saying it, bitch
Believe it cause I'm telling you
I'm doing the rapping and bussing
Ronson on the scratchin' and cuttin'

[Chorus]

Get down
Wait a minute now
Give it to them on the one

[Bridge]
This the intermission
I'll break it down so you niggas listen
Take a second to wipe my sweat
Might be the only chance you get to catch your breath
Don't get too comfortable in here
Niggas know I'm bringing back the rumble in here
Just when you thought you could cool down and sip some of that water
Shit
A nigga back
Say it again

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
Ladies and gentlemen, one more time
Put your hands together for Mystikal
Don't it feel good?
Ain't he making us feel good tonight?
Thank you Mr. Ronson for bringing us together this evening
We gon' go ahead and head over to the after party
We'll see y'all uptown
Come on[Intro: Future]
We gon’ get to it, nigga
By any means necessary
We were born like this

[Hook: Future]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Quarter-mill for the car, quarter-mill on the arm
Black Double-R, back the fuck off
Drophead, cut your head off, hard top, no soft
Wet pussy turn me on, money keep me hard
King shit, Versace tiles, I ain’t dryin’ off
Marble floors, you dusty niggas couldn’t walk on
Jesus walked on water, so I’mma walk on charters
Private jets, baguettes, only fuck with ballers
All this, half a mill, first week of August
I ain’t even doin’ shows, I’m just workin’ on the album
Forty for the feature, I just payed my mama’s Visa
You in the club breathin’, neck to neck, you niggas Beavis
She give me butt, head – get brain like a genius
I got that dope shit, the 80s chrome Alpinas
White Beamer – my son gon’ inherit this flow
You niggas gumball drops on the bottom of my sole

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Young nigga, we Rich Gang
Came up from that rich game
Picture me rollin’ down…
Black Double-R with your bitch, mane
With that top off and that drop head
Pull up on ‘em, they drop dead
Niggas talkin’ that bird shit
When them birds came, they was not dead
And I was out there with that work
From the 15th to the 1st
My clique mean and they merk
We’ll let them clips squeeze like dirt
When it come to them dollars, nigga, why bother?
These niggas don’t want no problems
‘Cause I’ll kill all y’all dead, put a price on your head
Get your brain, I doubt it
I be on that fly shit – M-O-B that mob shit
Boy, I’m talkin’ G5 shit
Fifty racks for that ride, shit
That ain’t yours, that’s my bitch
You clocked out and I signed in
We young niggas, we grindin’
We shinin’ like diamonds

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Make them pop ten bottles like, "give me ten more"
I’m in the club passin’ weed to the bitches, like “hit this shit”
Your stupid ass outside talkin’ ‘bout “get me in!”
Should’ve known I was a fool, when I moved
When I pulled up in that Bentley
Told y’all I was gangster, still somethin’ like a pimp
Don’t say I didn’t – million-dollar flow
Got a lot of dough, brand new clothes
VIP for niggas like me
Wish a motherfucker would touch that rope
Rappers, hustlers, dealers, killers
Thugs, goons, beasts, guerillas
Money, cars, jewels, chinchillas
Jets, cribs, condos, villas
Say that, then… (hold up)
Goddamn right, bitch I’ve been fly since way back when
That’s right, I am YMCM, Grave Street, play that, there
Burnin’ up the track like a motherfuckin’ matchstick
You know that’s him
Tryna shine when you come around stars like us
They do look dim
Ain’t got your game tight, ain’t got your swag up
Shame on them
Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big
Nigga, go to the gym
For the love of my clique, we up in this bitch
So sorry that your girl’s suckin’ my dick
Throwin’ money in the air like I’m sick of this shit

Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big
Nigga, go to the gym
For the love of my clique, we up in this bitch
So sorry that your girl’s suckin’ my dick
Throwin’ money in the air like I’m sick of this shit

[Hook]

[Outro: Stevie J]
We be on our fly shit
You see us right
Fly shit
Swag or die and we high
Haha Rich Gang
DJ Stevie J
Stunna, salute[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah, hell of a day
To load a .22 and take it to the woods and let it ring
Into the night and break a bottle with the bullet
Yes I'm 'bout it motherfucker, not a single solitary thing
Is missin' from my southern roots I'm liable just to take a Chevrolet
And run it through the mud for giggles
Huh, what a son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper
Who could tell story like my uncle when he's drinkin'
Product of a workin' environment, fuck is y'all thinkin'?
Meanin' I'm workin'-workin' harder than any artist
Can ever do it simply cause I'm made that way
I build a house around your ass before you could realize
That you were in the neighborhood that Yelawolf made
So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it
Tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanna-be, I be that
I'll just take it to the studio
And drop a bomb on you from a motherfuckin' beanbag
I need that..

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Get away, tell my folks roll up the J’s
Bring Yelawolf a deuce, we’ll sit up on the roof of the broken Chevrolet
Talk til there’s nothing left to say
Cause if I don’t get away, you gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways
Then you gon’ have to get away from me
Drink some, smoke some
You gone have to get away from me, load up the guns, load up the guns
Then you’ll have to get away from me
Drink some, smoke some
Cause if I don’t get away, you gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways
Then you gone have to get away from me

[Verse 2: Shawty Fatt]
Man, I done been through it all
I done been up and know what it is to fall
Punk police feeling all on my balls
Without a probable cause, cause a nigga sittin’ tall
"Dawg, you gotta do something Fatt
On the road with Wolf, why did you come back?"
Cause them up there, don’t wanna play fair
Got me pinned to the wall, like a fucking thumb tack. "Dumb fat!"
Dumb hell, criticize a nigga for the crack I sell
Like you could give a shit if a nigga eat well or eat at all, wanna see me fall
Let ‘em see that? Naw dawg, them lies
Only cause I got Catfish on my side
Bitch I'm headed up, up to the sky
Roll up, let's get high
Wavin' them bye, I need that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
20 plus 20 still spittin' 'em out
Still piss on your porch and still shit in your house
Then put my dick in your mouth, take it back out, put it back in
Fuck on the floor, skeet on the couch
Which one of you ugly muthafuckers think you thug enough or rugg enough
Or gutter enough, fast enough to keep up (huh)
The most retarded motherfucker in the whole wide world
Ain’t stupid or dumb enough to fuck with it
If you in say you in, and if you is handle your mutherfuckin’ business
Knuckle up, buckle up, hustle up, huddle up. What we gonna do? Win!
Not a nan’ ‘nother nigga outta there can compare
To what I do to these boys on these bars and these scales
In these clubs in these bars on these tables and chairs
I need that!

[Hook]
