Type of pussy nigga talking out her tongue
Yeah, yeah, that's how it goes with me
I just got a check up and ain't no ho with me
VIP bottles over D
On the couch got 'em all throwin fours with me
Hoes up, hoes down, all I gotta do is smile
You ain't want me back then, but I bet you want me now
Body going crazy, he want me to have his child
Fucking with them hoes, yeah I heard you getting around
Whisper him in the ear, tell him "I want it now"
He said "stop talking all that freaky shit, ain't tryna get aroused"
That's how it's post to be, yeah

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
They about to take your phone, just see

Ain't another nigga cold as me
Ain't another nigga cold as me (cold as me)
And I'm living like a movie, pretty women in the jacuzzi
The way she kissing on her friend, do she even like men?
My nigga she could have fooled me
I be tryna chill, stay tight
But they all want some, can you blame 'em?
Want their walls decorated, rearranged
Cause a nigga handsome, wealthy, famous
Who gives a fuck what they say, he say, she say
Hey Trey, ain't ya hear Jhen√© say
(But he gotta eat the booty like groceries)
You know how wild I be
Had that pussy like "Clean up on aisle 3"
Had that pussy like, slow down, whoa now, please
Every time I go down, go down like sheesh
(I make em do it!)
They know my name, I ain't even gotta say it
Put it to rest every time a nigga lay
Ain't another nigga cold as me
Butt, butt, butt naked is what you're post to be

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
AMG kit on the Benz
You got home girls, I got friends
Y'all should have come to the house
Get all topless then let's go swimming

That's just the beginning like it's post to be
Pocket rockets stay real close to me
And a new bitch stay close to me

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Dead or alive, sayin' boss top 5
Let my top down just to throw the rock sign
Not Jigga, Jay Dilla and the Pharcyde
I'm the realest, disagreeing with a Glock 9
But fuckin' with us, so he had to get the Benz truck
Cutting corners, lil nigga fuck your rims up
She can't fuck with me, she say she rock with Wale
Double M we throw them alley oops, that's all day
West side, it's going down at the Polo Lounge
Half pound for my rounds just to go around
Copy paste, tweez niggas even 'bout that slang
Black bottle in the sky, free Gucci Mane

Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me

But my head keep on spinnin'

Let's make some babies, and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside, you got me screamin'
You got me, yellin' out yo name oooh I need you
You kiss on my thighs, and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a beamer
Smooth like that henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not going to lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

[Outro]

Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representing West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Batgang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin'
Sippin' P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants
On the real

[Pre-Hook: Kid Ink]
You could call anyone you want
I'ma kill 'em all, bet on it

At your door like the shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga
And the bitch that I'm with know she hot stuff
Pull up in the hot wheels, ballin' get yo hops up
If you got a problem get a hotline

[Pre-Hook & Hook][Verse 1: Game]
My ambitionz of a rida-da-da
Put her in a YSL and that Prada-da-da
Keep the pistol on the side-da-da
In the Lamborghini smokin on that la-la-la
She got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek
'15 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek
I gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep
Say "You jigglin, baby", gave her the whole damn fleet

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
I always ride for you baby, and when shit get hard
You know I pull up on the side of you, baby
Yeah, I met him in a dope gang, he had no name
Back when you could get a half or a whole thang

In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya
Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it

[Verse 6: Dej Loaf]
You need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good, drop ass for ya
Yeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah

Why you gotta tell a nigga business
Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this

[Hook: Game + Dej Loaf]

But I'm a go and get the quarter goin'
Ignore the phone and the car alarm
Hold up, I'm 'bout to cum, no, false alarm
Makeup off, no weave, glasses off
Codeine, Adderall, it's a pussy marathon
Girl you don't love me, you just love my doggystyle
Put this dick up in your mouth while you're talkin'
Like what you talkin' 'bout?
Yeah cause you've been talkin', no more talkin'
While I make us a drink, and I don't drink
So when you're not lookin' I pour some out in the sink
Babe, I guess chemistry is true
But I don't know if it's the Hennessy or you
I heard you eat pussy too and I'm feelin' that
I hope your girlfriend feelin' me too
I'ma fuck her real good right next to you
Then look at you like it's finna be you
Me, Hennessy and you, and you

I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
I need a chick true talk, not fake with her walk
She got her hair done right, I be breakin' her off
I like them girls when I'm ready she be taking it off
She be tellin' me what to do cause she think she the boss
And I don't say nothin' to her, I let that money talk
We don't never trip much, we be shakin' it off
Win, lose, or draw, I back against the wall
I'm willing to grow, cause I've wanted it all
I'm one of a kind, she one of them dimes
Been at it for a while, we puttin' in time
I'm lovin' her thoughts, she changing my mind
We learnin' together, the stars align
Fly face, nice body, and swag crazy
She work and she goin' to school, she ain't lazy
And when she out and about, she look wavy
And when they try to ask what's up, she say Casey

[Hook 2: Dej Loaf & (Casey Veggies)]
I'll be a lady in the streets
In a dress with her hair tied up
Or I can be a freak in the sheets
In the room with her hands tied up
It's whatever you want, whatever you like
It's not a problem at all, whatever you like
Whatever you like (x3) (she'll do whatever I like)
Whatever you like (x3) (she'll do whatever I like) (x2)

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, shorty really rock with me
I took her to the block with me
She probably spent the whole night with me
Take a gold shot with me
All them girls flock for me
But she the one that's gone ride with me
We cruise through the hood, end up in Beverly Hills
We talked about how the lime light was never that real
She asked me questions about her sex, like how does it feel
Shorty you're the best, I'm just keepin' it real

[Hook 2: Dej Loaf & (Casey Veggies)]

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
Ladies grab your girl by the hand, let them know that you're versatile
Let them know you run shit in advance
Back it up on em' yeah, do your dance

[Bridge: Dej Loaf (x8)]
Do your dance

[Hook 1: Dej Loaf][Chorus x2]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

[Verse 1]
Bitch I got the mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
Give lil bro the choppa for all you actors
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi
Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'
IBGM the clique bitch you see us scorin'
V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'
Got a bitch that set it off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin' around wit yo nieces bitch T.T
Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin' like Italians, we really take yo fingas
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin' like Alicia, fuck wit my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzin'
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger
Lil Dej ain't bout it, bitch how you figure
I don't do no drugs, I be off liquor
So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture
See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin'
Niggas gossip like hoes, most of 'em bitches
I don't wanna do no songs, I don't wanna kick it
And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent

[Chorus][Hook: Tinashe]
All hands on deck
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind, take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Wasted heart
When you left me, you left me with no choice
I'm looking for a boy to fill this empty void
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh
Wasted hard
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Wasted hard
Done here's to death do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners, search and destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch 'em go down, watch 'em fall like dominoes
Watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
I say all hands on deck
Bend it over, beat it up, put your hands on that
If you play your cards right, I can deal with that
I'm a queen, you a king, now let's build with that
[?] I came, ain't nothing the same
I got older and I realized the game, would I stay the same
Fucking right I changed and you're the one to blame
You're the one who broke me down yeah our love was insane
Whoa, I pull off with my new ones
Girl mad, when I see her she don't do nothing
I ain't looking for beef, I'm looking for freaks
I got so weak in the knees, that's WB
I tell that nigga, I tell that nigga, like its nothing to me
You looking for me, I'm over here in VIP play
Who want to drink, all the drinks on me
Put your hands in the air if you fucking with me

[Hook](x2)[Verse 1: Game]

They can't put me in a box, free my niggas locked
Every day I pop a bottle for my niggas in the sky

We gon' slim it down, we gon' take over your town
Ain't no hoes in my circle, nah we don't fuck around

Bitches wasn't real so I stopped answering the phone
Getting right with God, cause real talk I'm a God
I was dead broke and it was all because of pride
I'm alive money on my mind, for my team I'mma ride
I ain't worried bout the drive, it's time to go get it and grind
Put them people to the side, wait and let them see you shine
They gon' hate but that's life, you live it and take flights
Doing shows every night, thanking god for the life
I earn my stripes, I'm a boss, started cutting people off
Talking shit and drinking Voss, don't ask me what it cost
Real talk, this that shit you play in your loft
We trying take it so far you rolling get in the car
They rolling it in the car, no smoking but keep a jar
I never thought small, I loved everything large
Started coming up head blue like mars
I started coming up stay humble couldn't fumble
These niggas talk cash, but all I hear is mumble
So I ain't really trying hear it, I'm really trying to bubble like

[Hook]x2

[Outro]
Cash rules everything around me

9-1-1 but we don't ever call the cops, for real

[Pre-Hook & Hook][Verse 1: Oba Rowland]
Big ass smile on your bitch ass
Chevy crown on your bitch ass
Coming down on your bitch ass
Run my town, your bitch ass
7 Mile and your bitch ass
Living on your bitch ass
Kill a boy and your bitch ass
You ain't [?] and your bitch ass
Middle class and your bitch ass
Mom and Dad and your bitch ass
Taught right from wrong and your bitch ass
Taught how to love with your bitch ass
9-5 and your bitch ass
Still selling dimes and your bitch ass
Foster child and your bitch ass
This my life and your bitch ass, nigga

[Hook: DeJ Loaf]
Why would want to be like them
Let go and just free yourself
Real niggas don't need no help
I love it when you be yourself

[Post- Hook: DeJ Loaf (Oba Rowland)]
Be Yourself (Love it when you be yourself)
Be Yourself
Be Yourself (I love it when you be yourself)
Be Yourself (Love it when you be yourself)
Be Yourself

[Verse 2: Oba Rowland]
Never cheated on your bitch ass
Bet you heated with your bitch ass
Your boyfriend weak and his bitch ass
Bought my CD with your bitch ass
Can't run from me and your bitch ass
No Degree on your bitch ass
My shit don't stink, it smell like potpourri on your bitch ass
Fuck what yall think, I'm off that ocean breeze and your bitch ass
You stuck in place, can't get close to me with your bitch ass
Never tuck my chain, cause I'm sucka free on your bitch ass
Hoes love my name, you don't even know what it means with your bitch ass, nigga

[Hook: DeJ Loaf]+[Post-Hook: DeJ Loaf (Oba Rowland)]X2[Verse]
Aye , that's that bird call
All these haters got my nerves bad
Writing rhymes in my word pad, feeling like I can't be touched
Drinking VOSS as a chaser
I got to get this paper for my unborn creations
Promise we gon' live it up, we ain't worried about haters
I promise they gon' give it up, and if not we gon' take it
I got a temper this short and I barely got patience
He got a dick this long, I think he from Jamaica
These niggas talking like they killers, I just call them pretenders
I'm getting money with my niggas, I don't want y'all around me
Ain't drop an album in two years these dummies thinking I lost it
They done buried me alive, i'm bout' to climb out this coffin
Let me find out that you hating, Imma fucking assault you
Put a hammer to your head, got some shit that would shock you
Put the plug in your ass, that's them battery chargers
Heard your plug had a shortage, need a battery charged
I'm looking in the sky like damn they can't handle your daughter
Fuck they mean I'm trying to pull up in that Phantom or something
Dirty Sprite, Cream Soda, dirty Fanta or something
I couldn't work no 9 to 5 , I wasn't good taking orders
But I promise with this music I be feeling immortal
I swear she would have been a beast, R.I.P. cousin Portia
And just for you I'm a cop me like two of them Porshes
I was down on my luck I had to use all my sources
No magazine spreads, couple funeral service
Time to clean the hood up, that community service
We ain't tipping no dancers, y'all bitches be worthless
Might pull up to the club in like two of them suburbans
I touch souls nigga, from the hood to the burbs'
Bitches steady sending shots, they confusing their words
I'm a dog with this shit, I pooper scooper these turds
Diamonds dancing like Omarion in You Got Served
Tell that lame she don't want it, I been getting money
Stop flashing that little jewelery cause my little homies on it
They'll snatch it right up off your neck
Flaunt your shit then sell it back
Nikki said "Stop holding back", they sleeping on me, taking naps
It's time to wake these pussies up, big dog to these cats
All I know is keep it real, all I know is stating facts
All I know when I get home, ain't gonna' do no turning back
All y'all know is turning up, don't know how to get a check
I know it's my time now, I don't think they get it yet
Open up your lid and put a symbol on your fitted cap
Think about it, let it sit
Yeah bitch, remember that?
He think that we going far, he should have used this thinking cap
Old flames calling me, they trying to rekindle that
But they know i'm about my money, they know i'm not into that
Sneak dissing twitter shit, I ain't with the internet
Log off and get smacked, I ain't with the chitter chat
Million dollar baby, i'm so million dollar wavy
I can't wait to make a million goin' million dollar crazy
Millionaire in the making, Benjamins and them Franklins
I'm running right next to greatness, yeah bitch that's a chaser
Niggas be talking crazy, but they hustle so lazy
I'm out here grinding for a life that could never be basic
Leave you in the street, they gon' yellow that taper
I'm like free my little brother, fuck the law trying to take us[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
It was hard to hear at first
I couldn‚Äôt understand what you sayin‚Äô
And these bitches bound to get hurt
‚ÄòCause a lot of these niggas be playin‚Äô
And I fuck with shorty on the low
And I know she know I‚Äôm the man
So that extra shit gotta go
She probably don‚Äôt know that I fucked her friend
If she ask about it
I‚Äôm a be like, ‚ÄúBlah blah blah blah‚Äù
When she try to argue with me
I be like, ‚ÄúBlah blah blah blah‚Äù
Trying to get back with me
I be like, ‚ÄúHell nah nah nah‚Äù
And we ain‚Äôt talking about no money
I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúBlah blah blah blah‚Äù

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I said, nigga be talkin' that blah
'Til you walk up with that blah, we ain't playin'
Heard he got hit in his eye
Heard he got bust in his mouth, see I'm sayin'?
Shorty gon' get on that D
First she gon' get on her knees, she ain't prayin'
Told her I'ma run it right back
Dog it ain't even like that, she ain't stayin'
I ain't got no fuckin' time, 'less it's fuckin' time
You ain't with it, go, please don't waste my fuckin' time
Got places to go, got people to see
Got this kilo on my neck, I'm just keepin' it G
Niggas dissin' for a listen, waitin' for a mention
Niggas lose all respect tryna gain attention
All this extra shit, man I need choppers with extensions
And all this work out here, you'd think we're waitin' on a pension, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Every time I talk to my baby mama
She like "Blah, blah, blah, blah"
Every time I fuck on my Spanish bitch
She call me papa
Every time I hit the club
I came with all of my niggas
Them niggas over there, they broke
I take all of their bitches
I spend all of this money
Then get it right back in the morning
Got that Sprite in my cup
With some of that you ain't even know it
Wash that zanny down with that M√∂et
I be fucked up but I never show it
Bought 10 bottles, I ain't even pour up
I just came to make the shit go up
Yeah, ball out on these hoes
Bars out on these hoes, I'll leave without these hoes
That's on my mama, that's on the game
It's so loud, I can't hear what you're sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dej Loaf]
I done made a hundred K this week
Lord, why they wanna hate on me?
All white, not a stain on me
Diamonds dance like K.O.D
Pimp shit, should have a cane on me
I'm in Saks, no c'est la vie
I don't Tampa, that's 813
Them niggas know I'm from the 313
This bitch think she fuckin' with me
Tell her body bag herself
And I did this on my own
I ain't ever ask for help
Fuck you mean? That's that cash you smelled
Talk crazy, no pastors here
Make a pussy do a backwards flip
Hallelujah yeah the pastor's here
Choppers spit, ch-choppers out
Chopper style, hundred rounds
Get on the ground, don't make a sound, yeah, yeah
Keep runnin' your mouth, have them boys run in your house
Silencer don't make a sound
Blah, blah, blah, blah
These pussies off their mark

[Hook][Produced by Lambo]

[Intro: Birdman]
Yep, top floor what I'm sayin' (guns up)
Blood line run deep, boy, what's up Dej? Stunna Man
Brackin' in the bity, boolin' with some bitches
Straight bleedin', gettin' our ones up
Straight 'bout this B game, big money poppin' over here
G5 - BRRRAT! BRRRAT! BRRRAT! Rich Gang!

[Hook: Dej Loaf] x2
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir, no way
It ain't no ho in my blood
No way, no sir

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
It ain't no ho in my blood, born and raised in them slums
Took my daddy away when I was 4, why would I give a fuck about y'all?
Ain't no ho in my blood, been thorough since day 1
Lost a couple people, ever since then I've been numb
Ain't no ho in my blood, Sell Sole gon' flood
If I don't make it off of this again fuck this shit, I'm done
Cause ain't no ho in my blood, no hoes in my circle
Loyalty over love, I'll kill a bitch on purpose
Cause ain't no ho in my blood, everybody 100
All I know is flip it back, we don't do no frontin'
We don't do no runnin', it ain't in my DNA
Blood thicker than water, but my money thicker than that

[Bridge: Dej Loaf]
They are some hoes, hoes, let's talk about these hoes
Sellin' all that pussy yet you ain't go no prose
Bitch you slow, slow, slow
Bitch you slow, slow, slow
And you's a ho, ho, let's talk about these hoes
Moochin' off your niggas, you can't stand up on your own
Boy you's a ho, ho, ho
Boy you's a ho, ho, ho

[Verse 1 (Continued): Dej Loaf]
No ho in my blood, always been a boss
Always had style, no matter what it cost
Other bitches, they was fuckin', I was all about the money
I was in the 7th grade, shootin' dice for the money
Tryna hit this other 9-5, writin' rhymes by the nightlight
Tryna get us up out the hood
So I could have all my people lookin' and livin' good

[Hook: Dej Loaf] x2

[Interlude: Young Thug]
I mean, it's not 1%, nigga
Not even half of 1%, bitch

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Hey Loaf, I'm just boolin' nigga on block
No police, if I like that shit I cop
No Rollie but you can watch
Me, put this feature back in the pot
Grindin' like a skater, nigga
I get fresh and go straight to the mall and bait a nigga
You want beef? I can cater nigga
I'm not a ho or pussy, so she ride that dick like a Speed Racer, nigga
Started from the bottom, came straight to the top
No dad but if he play, he get popped
You ain't real, squad, so you can't come to the block
I wanna see blood but I ain't come with a mop
I'ma pop his top, proceed to the top
Let these bullets work on a nigga's body like a doctor

[Bridge 2: Young Thug]
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
I swear ain't no ho inside my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood
It ain't no ho in my blood

[Hook: Dej Loaf] x2

[Outro: Birdman]
Real recognize real
Money, power and action over here, boy
King Slime - BRRRAT! Big money poppin'

[Outro 2: Young Thug]
I'm far from a ho nigga
As a matter of fact, I'm one of the biggest Bloods in fuckin' America, you know
Flippin'! Any nigga, any mothafucka wanna get in the way of this shit
Nigga, try to stop this shit from goin' to the top and we flip 'em
We gon' show 'em we not hoes, Dej Loaf what up?[Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want less (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely as 'bout it as retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
We tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles ol' Air, his coupe
Might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(It's Nickel) Ridin' 'round this block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
(Welcome to Detroit, motherfucka)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit your kisser, bet your ass not remembering
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Has K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Kettering
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein‚Äôs son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC'd the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On a track get spanked like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows
May be in for another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you but ain't shit changing
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler, and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

[Hook]

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though, it's the godfather Trick, Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!!
Hey Em, let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'
Detroit! Okay![Intro]
Don't you ever forget. Don't you ever take sides with anyone against the family. Do you hear me? Ever

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
What up doe, everybody? I'm Detroit
So it's me vs. everybody if you ain't Detroit
We all hood, we love the gun smoke
A message from air traffic control
I'm doin' them niggas bold
Takin' it back to when rappers got beat up out their clothes
Treat 'em like little hoes
Used to wake up to snitches swingin' from light poles
When the booger shook took a light those
Shout out to every nigga that ever made money over in Brightmoor
With the white folks, in the window like a psycho
Puttin' the perfect play together, maestro
And since it's so cold in the D, if you don't come to see me
You might fuck around and see a nigga ice go
Had a lil' homie, run up on him with a knife though
Aiight ho, watch the big homie on the roof with the rifle
Who might go loco and shoot for nothin'
Will go postal with you for somethin'
And I'm willin' to give it to keep the counterfeits up out of my city
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Still pull it together for the kitty
Pour a little liquor for Biggie
And Frank Nitty on the Mickey, send 'em to Diddy
Tried to get me a spot on the Revolt
Switch a man's past from the revolt
Touchin' mothafuckas with the remote
Think your man sleepin' out here but nigga please, he woke

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Detroit V.S. everybody, P.S
Fuck y'all too, we don't care what y'all do
Still, you can't deny the real
Time reveal, society squeals and the society kill
Money motivated though we take it
These cats are overrated, severely, poppin' up yearly
Then they disappear within the same year
Like it never happened, them niggas just rappin' barely
I'm a shooter, loadin' my magazine and throw the book at 'em
Like a prosecutor, the Glock'll do you like a college tutor
Cause right after class
I teach a mothafucka somethin' and watch him pass
Graduation, I rattle cages
We make some uncomfortable, I didn't grow up like the Huxtables
West 7th where those drugs'll move nonstop
Soft white or hard rock, get everybody in your yard shot
You'll get a feel for my city when I send the welcoming committee
With the 50 calibers and the smoke grey Dodge Challengers
You frown on your face, we'll kick it pretty
When I grip the semi, you better have some grip to give me
Or the steel smokes, you cats are real jokes
You bitch niggas, smack your face numb like you feel coke
Until you get the big picture, mothafucka

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Milk]
Let the celebration kick off
This that point in the party where that person start pointin'
That pistol because they're pissed off
Shots lick off, fire spit off
This track put a fire up under me like rockets when they lift off
The map, these rappers that recite raps
We don't believe 'em like that
Deadbeat dad sayin' that he'll be right back
But city that's rough and looked at as them black sheeps
With them rap sheets that's long as track meets
So let's take a stroll, come follow me down these back streets
Where blacks and the trap meet
Killers and dealers that had dreams to be athletes
But them dreams got put in the back seat
And makin' fast funds the shotgun
Got some homies that's still in the hood, life finna twirl
They ask me "what is it like to see the rest of the world?"
Away from the block, away from the gutter
All they know is the blocks and watchin' for cops undercover
So what you have here, some niggas that's never had a fear they couldn't face
Tougher than '89 Laimbeer in the paint
Posted, Chuck D coachin', never laid up
City soil that made us
7 mile with the players, Puritan and PA-ers
[?] where the bullets strayin'
Fenkell where the bodies layin'
6th mile where them hollows sprayin'
Woodward where they ain't playin'
Schoolcraft you find that mayhem where hollows holler in the AM
Gratiot where grandma's stayin'
Neighborhood that's decayin'
Niggas pockets is light so that light bill they're never payin'
So fam don't let your lips talk, that could be your pitfall
And get you sprayed on like murals on side of brick walls
Dudes watchin' waitin' for you to get sloppy
Like a hitman lurkin' in the shadows with his shotty
Out here screamin' "Let's go", yeah my nigga X know
City where the TECs blow but we ain't talkin' techno

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Sino]
I'm stumblin' in my Detroit fitted, bitch
Anybody want some beef then we with it, bitch
Shit, see in the Mitten all my niggas 'bout that action
Might be 30 niggas with me, every nigga with me packin'
No fly zone, shit, just for pussies on that fuck shit
Dirty glove, boy this ain't the city to be fucked with
Shout out my uncle Trick, you get to trippin', he gon' dump quick
My city verses everybody (you gotta kill everybody!)
Boy, RIP to Blade, I hope he hear this
I swear if Ron was free, he'd be the first nigga to kill this
Street nigga, give me a ki and I'ma deal it
Better give a nigga his cash or you can feel it
What up Em, signed the city to Shady and fuck it
They say the world is a bitch, I'ma keep on fuckin' it
My city on my back and I'ma keep on runnin' it
Still got that chopper on the back seat, ain't shit sweet, boy

[Verse 6: Marv Won]
40287, I'm out that black bottom
If they don't fuck with the boy, I bet the crack got 'em
It's enough two faces here to attack Gotham
And ain't nobody a ho until the MACs spot 'em
Dot 'em, play possum, no brave option
All of mine yay choppin' and K shoppin'
The nerve this nigga here can play the part of a goon
Transplant your killers if it ain't no heart in the room
Wait 'til he sugar sharp and then throw salt in the wound
These red beams'll turn your white party maroon
I got a pair of gators that I hardly wear
Nigga I will kill you over these Cartiers
I got a couple bands with the dice on the floor
When I was 9, boy I could tell you the price of a bow
Listen, full length minks just to show we stuntin'
Brother you know it's nothin'
Nigga I'm Komen youngin', tell 'em!

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Payroll]
I'm from the west side blocks where we roll in spots
And have blow blowout sales to blow out a watch
Young niggas gettin' popped cause of the clique they claim
And in most homicides, it's a bitch to blame
My future plan's to stay froze 'til my wrist complains
If rap fails, I'm whippin' coke 'til the brick complains
In the new 6 switchin' lanes, probably with big kis
Ain't talkin' coffee when I say the trunk is where the big be
You see that D right above where my lid be
Can't trust a soul, well that's how these streets did me
I bossed up from setbacks by luck, I rep that
Ain't scared of nigga's shit, I'm from Detroit, I expect that

[Verse 8: Hydro]
Look I'm from Detroit, bitch
Where we crack heads and we break bails
Inspired by the dopeman that pack hammers and make sales
Dreaming of a rollie, a coupe, a crib off of late trails
They quick to take a trip with so much weight that it'd break scales
Young boys wilding, with a chopper they'll make hail
Screaming "fuck the cops" and quick to pop off like some fake nails
Shout out to my strippers with 30 inches and fake tails
And pounds of the cookie like I was running a bake sale
Holla if you need it, I got it, just come and ask the man
Try me and get cheddar on your hand just like a Packer fan
Riding down your mama street with tints on a blacker van
And turn your block into a war zone like we in Pakistan
Nobody I can call on, it's ball or get balled on
Wrists full of that shit you niggas can slip and fall on
Why the fuck you hating us when we can put them all on?
And they can help their little mans and they can hit the mall strong
It's 7 Mile 'till I die, raised by some street niggas
Fuck friends, ain't got none, I'm dolo with this heat, nigga
Boogers in my watch face, my wrists be looking slimey
Once I fuck she's like my seatbelt, I put that bitch behind me, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Big Gov]
My timing was perfect, designed to be worshiped
Like Jesus as a fetus
Was destined to earn my stripes like Adidas
Needless to say I'm the sniper
Pick us off, niggas soft
While they spitting bars in the middle of a cypher
I'm from the same hood as Big Meech and Big T
So miss me with ho shit or end up on this street
Home of the big three; big cuffs, big guns, big chips
Where broke niggas get hood rich off of quick flips
I'm from the city where the bitches even gangster
Suck a nigga dick, get her robbed, tell 'em thank you
We don't fuck with you outsiders, learn who to talk to
Or get stomped for feeling like the man when you walk through
And I don't even walk around with my chest out
But know it's drama when you see me with my vest out
My next route is finding out where you rest at
Catch you sleep, make the crime scene where you slept at
And the next cat who disrespect my city on some rap shit
I'm on his ass like cellulite on a fat bitch
This shit is drastic and you ain't gotta ask if
A nigga come disrespectful, he leaving out in a casket

[Verse 10: Boldy James]
Detroit VS everybody, that's me against the world
I might not sell a cop, but who need a brick or girl?
A thousand grams on my cock, later alligator
Moist of the aviator, cardi sipping activator
Never been a punk, faker or a lean whipper
Steady packing eighters in a one paper king swish
Concrete, definition of real street nigga
Whole hood know that I'm the only real D nigga
That really mean it when you hear me say I am Detroit
Can hear it in my voice, my fault Em and Royce
For being four days late turning my verse in
But me and Ready Rock was in the spot putting that work in
What was you doing before you ever touched your first ten?
I was in the streets with my peeps getting them chirps in
Text me when the work gone, I text him back the work end
Tryna get my hands on the pack when they first in
On my Captain Planet I possess earth, wind and fire
But you being a liar is the worst sin
Keep throwing rocks at the throne with a glass chin
I'm still that same nigga on the corner with a half grin
I never let these niggas use my ears for no trash cans
Been selling dope for too long, it's time to cash in
King James, before this rap shit I had street fame
And the keys to the city on my key chain

[Hook]

[Verse 11: Kid Vishis]
Whoever said Vishis phony, get to know me
Our hollows'll make a rapper drop the mic, no diss to Joey
Guns of all sizes, I fire and get smokey
Riding with the biggest ratchet on the car dash, I call it Khloe
You think you hard? I think you doughey
His guts'll fall out looking like someone stuck a knife in a stoagie
Homie, you owe me your life
I'm Columbine balling, throwing a stripe
Wiping you out and bounce like a thief in the night
I now control machinery, it's like real steel
Gun ductaped to the tires, that mean I will kill
They say I'm fooling to 'em
They asked me for a hot sixteen
So I lit my notebook on fire and threw it to 'em
Here's a DeJ Loaf punchline
I kill your whole family and leave a red trail, that's your bloodline
Try me, I bust nines
Stick a clock in his mouth and make him chew
Yeah, nigga, it's crunch time

[Verse 12: Big Herk]
We got them choppers, how a nigga with a knife gon' win?
Y'all just shooting the breeze, they done let a cyclone in
This what happen when little mama boys trapped grown men
Lyrically ahead of my time like the iPhone 10
And why Detroit always get a bad name?
My city ready to blow like we here to gas, mane
These niggas thinking they dope, but their shit a tad lame
Man, their pen and pad game more like Trinidad James
Fuck you and whoever you run with
I'm on that BS, I'm still in the middle with dumb shit
I'm a beast, everything you hear me spit real tight
Your flow wack, it's out of Egypt, nigga, it's real light (get it?)
I'mma keep it real, niggas can't fuck with me
It's like I contracted Ebola, they ain't touching me
Detroit VS Everybody, niggas know we started that
Now every city all across the world want a part of this

[Hook]

[Verse 13: Icewear Vezzo]
Street niggas smarter than Kwame, bustin' hardbody
Panorama fold up Porsche, let the car box me
I know niggas ain't sold shit, they did armed robberies
Rugrats buying out bottles and playing with old Tommy's
East side, come to the zone, that's where the lions play
Young niggas stepping on blow, that's where the tigers stay
In my hood the first of the month, that shit a holiday
These cemeteries meet their capacity every fathers day
Hit a lick, keep all the work, get the stolie back
Tell a jeweler don't say shit, just get the Rollie checked
If them niggas bump one lip then get your homies wacked
I swear that you knew my boss, bitch, I'm Tony Jack
Real shooters run in the trap with them choppers out
Heard them niggas bumping their gums, see what they talkin' 'bout
In a spot with so much syrup, this bitch a waffle house
Hit the pharma with so many scripts, could buy the doctors out

[Verse 14: Detroit Che]
I'm Detroit Che
I'm as sick as some syphilis, sicker than Detroit hate
If you come knocking then it's trick or treat
I call up Tricky, load that shit then let that trigger squeeze
That shit ain't sweet, I'm from the murder mitten
Never thought my friend would've been a murder victim
I'm in that van, I want revenge, I'm on some Kendrick shit
I'm pissed off like a mistle, his dick's soft, he's ticked off, he can't get shit hard
If you diss my city I will set it off with a motherfucking semi that's bigger than Big Sean
Our city is Marshall Mathers on Adderall
You better pray we not mad at all when them gats involved
With swisher cap, we're flicking your fucking city off
I'll bust your fucking noggin, you disrespecting my city, dawg
I'm queen Che been on the throne for a minute
Before the cypher I've been slicing dice, these hoes will admit it
Bitch, I'm Slim Shady, we louder than M80's
No, I'm just playing, hope he hears it, I'm just saying
I'm a renegade, pussy sweeter than lemonade
You'll never penetrate
DeJ, tell these bitches to try me, I'mma demonstrate
Vez, tell them that I got options, I'm a real estate
On them properties like monopoly
Detroit VS Everybody, I make a verse versus everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's Detroit Che versus everybody
Detroit vs everybody, it's Detroit vs everybody
Fuck your city, no fly zone, nigga, it's my city versus everybody

[Verse 15: Calicoe]
(I just have to talk shit for a minute, man
I have to get in my zone, man, huh
It's the going, going, back, back to Cali, Cali, to Cali Cali)
Cali Cali, that's where I get them cheaper at
Your number like my number, I need a number I can reach you at
Want my price, then you get a price, I want at least a stack
You pay my flight, then you pay your flight, I'll meet you back
Middle man in my own plug, I can teach you that
Detroit vs everybody, who could compete with that?
You thinking everybody zips slow cause they got a plug?
My nigga, everybody zips slow cause I'm showing love
So whenever you make a flip again just know I'm showing love
If cash die, I'm on the strip again, just know I'm throwing dubs
Big roochies on the Michelins, rolling A1 dubs
Mind on my money, fuck a nigga tryna hold a grudge
Them crabs in the bucket used to slow me up
And now I'm sitting at the top and it's lonely as fuck
Got 20 thousand for my red bottoms
Cause I was standing in this blood after I headshot 'em, nigga

[Verse 16: Diezel]
It's me, bitch
Mafia captain, OG, bitch
20 years, been Detroit vs whoever, nigga
The right hand to the hand that be gettin' niggas
Goon squad mafia, mobbin'
For this dirty mothafucka, where it's my home
And I love this mothafucka
So I stood on the front line, ready for one time
Duck some shots, and buck bled for my line
All for the love of the palm of the dirty glove
Every hood, every block, nigga one love
7 mile is the hood where I came up
Pray the game keep it and get your weight up
Bitch you better say us when you're talkin' 'bout next
Detroit niggas stood up when put to the test
Like what? Nigga, who? What the fuck
Anybody wanna do? We ain't hear shit
One army, one city, one sound
It's Detroit, gon' shut shit down
It's time to return the king his crown
Fuck who got next, nigga we got now[Produced by Statik Selektah]

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 1: Dej Loaf]
Ayo east side, raised on that east side
When we just throw our pinkies up along with the peace sign
Fairview street sign, who the fuck are these guys?
Niggas want war, we make 'em feel it, touch their G spot
My grandma sold pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout no key lime
Junkies at the side door, make sure that ain't 5-0
They done set her up, they done hit her with that combo
They done let the dogs out, house smellin' like Pine Sol
That was on the north end, I was on the porch then
Grandma what you cookin' up? Grandma why that fork bent?
Grandma where my mom at? Now I want her, beep her up
Always imagined we was poor and that her feet was up
Jordans, yeah we had 'em on, bitch it wasn't no teasin' us
Remember me and Pooh was in the window eatin' peanut butter
Damn I miss my cousin, I'm like R.I.P. to Trina's son
I'm from where it ain't no love, everybody need a gun

[Verse 2: SayItAint]
I say
I'm 'bout to kill, these niggas ho, I'm breakin' bread with Dej Loaf
And I ain't ever been a ho, bitch I prefer the fur coat
If Detroit was a farm, nigga I'ma be the GOAT
If my hood had a parade, nigga I'ma be the float
If my bitch call me "Boo", nigga I'ma be a ghost
R.I.P. to Martell, I couldn't see my cousin grow
And I put on for the Mitten, don't get burnt by the stove
Me and money go together like L, M, N, O
Yep and R.I.P. to To, why you had to go?
I'm tryna keep my poise, son, like Bell Biv Devoe
And I tell a bitch, "Act like you've been here before"
And she told me she like heel so I got that bitch coke
Yeah, and my nigga I ain't talkin' 'bout no shoe game
My niggas know I got 'em like Bruce Wayne
All I do is hang around apes, nigga, no lames
Every time I come I'm in the ghost, that's my boo thang
Bitch I'm from the...

[Verse 3: Oba Rowland]
West side, raised on that west side
By both parents and a chopper, lord knows I got problems
Drawer full of condoms, fuck everybody
I tried to change my tendencies
I got less friends than enemies
Try me, I'ma get your mothafuckin' fam like the Kennedy's
It'll go on for infinity, knowin' I'ma never get my fuckin' props
I'm fat but I'll fuck your mama in your daddy's house
Hit her doggy style while the cat around, and bust a nut
On your hand-me-downs, now you got nothin' to wear
You wasn't prepared, I'm in studios that Puffy was in
You puffin' on squares
Cuffin' the ass of a bitch with Rapunzel-like hair
Capone got killed, I'm huntin' 'em still
If they die a natural death, I'm huntin' their kids
We never forgive, especially when
The chances we chance for the advancement of cash
Abruptly comes to an end
Shit I'm just lucky my life just wasn't in sin
Keep all my dead homies covered in gin
See I know niggas' history, these stories do not fit you
Nobody gave this fat nigga a pass
Like back when the Lions had Scott Mitchell
Beef is when I get you before the cops get you
Every time I see niggas with fake DVE
I pray the cops with 'em if God isn't

[Hook][Hook]
Love ain't ever been so easy
Love ain't ever been so easy
I love how you make it so easy
I love how you make it so easy

[Verse 1]
I love how you push it in so deeply
Make my body quiver, baby, make my feet shake
I love how you kiss me on both set of lips
Lick me 'til I cum, ayy this that shit you won't forget
Okay, let's play, baby finish your plate
I'm tuggin' on your zipper and you grabbin' on my waist
No games, foreplay, shut up, do what I say
Open up your mouth, put this pussy on your face
Nigga behave, that's exercise, he ain't nothin' like them extra guys
Got myself a real nigga, so hatin' hoes would be glad to get him
Just chill with him, iced up on chill with him
Couple shots of that Peach Ciroc, he know I'm gon' deal with him
I'm like what's wrong with him, pussy wet, no thong with him
Strip club, in my zone with him, throwin' money on my old nigga
I'm gone, nigga, silent mode, no phones with it
Never fuck with no broke nigga
He know I ain't know gold digger
He got me like

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
He's got me waitin' up all night, all night just to hit
I'm in the studio, then I pull out to your crib
Scratches on your back, I didn't mean to do that, baby
I couldn't help myself, you be fuckin' me so crazy
On the couch, on the sink, in the shower, you a freak
In the whip, the backseat, windows tint, they can't see
You know how it goes, I ain't gotta say shit
I want this here forever, just me and you to the end

[Hook] x2[Verse 1: Game]
My ambitions of a rida-da-da
Put her in a YSL and that Prada-da-da
Keep the pistol on the side-da-da
In the Lamborghini smokin' on that la-la-la
She got her hair in the wind, eyebrows on fleek
'15 Bonnie & Clyde, Nicki and Meek
I gave her keys to the condo, keys to the Jeep
Say "You jigglin, baby", gave her the whole damn fleet

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
I always ride for you baby, and when shit get hard
You know I parade on the side of you, baby
Yeah, I met him in a dope gang, he had no name
Back when you could get a half or a whole thang

[Verse 3: Game]
Back when we all ever needed was the cocaine
Bricks in the 600 why they call me Raw Game
40 in the Sti dash fuck around and be road kill
With the top down feelin' like

[Hook: Game + Dej Loaf]
My ambitions of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitions of a rida (rida, rida)
My ambitions of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitions of a rida-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
My ambitions of a rida

[Verse 4: Dej Loaf]
No whip now we in the Ray Roll Range
Keep it gangsta pricy, one of them cold things
Wit ya, noooo, I ain't mad at ya
Get out of line, probably throw a couple jabs at em

[Verse 5: Game]
Hit Rodeo, probably throw a couple bags at ya
In my 2Pac voice - I ain't mad at ya
Take the wheel, see if you can drive while I eat it
My fitted flew off, but I dont need it, tell me what I need

[Verse 6: Dej Loaf]
You need a bitch that's gonna blast, spend cash with ya
Same time fuck good, drop ass for you
Yeah, I ride it like rah-rah-rah-rah
Eat the pussy like la-la-laaaa

[Verse 7: Game]
Why you gotta tell a nigga bidness
Fine nigga Friday, you know a nigga live this
Hit you with the helicopter tongue
Then fuck you til the helicopter come

[Hook]

[Verse 8: Game + Dej Loaf]
One look and I got her
In corners in my Impala
(My ambitions of a rida)
Slidin down that pole for a dollar
Nada, tell that girl "holla"
(My ambitions of a rida)
I done brought the thug life out her
Got her stuffin' bricks in that Prada
(My ambitions of a rida)
And she love when I'm inside her
And can't nobody divide us

[Hook][Verse 1: Danny Seth]
Talkin' 'bout money?
Shit, I'm about to make a lot
See the Rollie on my left wrist?
It's the reason I don't use a clock
Check the Rollie once again
Still I have to for the cops
And if you hatin' on the low
Better stand up 'fore your punk ass gets dropped
I'm a trendsetter
Tryna make bread like Mayweather
Comparin' me to other man, I'm way better
This lamb skin, boy you rock fake leather
I ain't got time for the beef, mothafucka
Cook it like Boyardee mothafucka
And everybody wanna be me, see me
They'll be on my nuts like tight jeans, mothafucka
I just checked and I got next
I ain't talking alphabet but I'm better with your ex
You be hangin' with the 6s while I'm bangin' out the 10s
And I'm from the UK, flow like the River Thames
So come flow with me
When I'm sonning all these rappers like an ovary
And I'm puffin' off a tree with some potent leaves
Cause we made it from the UK overseas and that's real

[Verse 2: Dej Loaf]
It's not givin', it's just takin', it's just takin'
Live your life, roll your blunts and chase Nathan
I've been out here for a minute, it's my time
Bought a watch, before a crib
I'm too important, I can't show you where I live
Why they think that they can stop me? I'm goin' so hard
I'm facin' my fears, face full of tears
I'm scarred for life, so I'ma ball for life
DJ play my song tonight, alright
Russian Roulette, one to the neck
Break you to pieces and open your flesh
Am I in love? Am I the best?
It could be lust, you obsessed with the sex
I'm obsessed with the thought of me breakin' your heart
Rollies for breakfast and APs for brunch
We done got rich and forgot who we was
I think you would too if you came from the slums
For life, alright
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Jesse Rutherford] x2
Give me the rule, and I'll take it
I couldn't fake all the things that I say
I know the rules, but I'm playin'
In the game that'll throw you away

What you grindin' for? Just tell me what you grindin' for
Who you grindin' for? Just tell me who you grindin' for
Who you grindin' for? Just tell me who you grindin' for
To get my people off the corner
Cause I see death there on the corner
I gotta make it, all or nothin'
Turn that nothin' into somethin'

[Verse 1]
Ain't tryna to work no 9 to 5, I gotta hustle, bro
I had to quit that shit I had to get my hustle on
Now I'm chargin' for my features, niggas buggin' though
They want a friend, they don't need to know my struggle though
I'm in the lab, I'm goin' ham, I feel untouchable
My people waitin', they like, "Dej when you gon' drop Sell Sole?"
They tryna knock me off my square but I can't fuckin' go
These niggas, they don't wanna help, they want the X and O's
I gotta get it how I live and ain't gon' sell myself
I might be too real for this shit is what I tell myself
I love this shit, I want it bad, what would you do for wealth?
A couple cars, a couple cribs all to yourself
Say what's your purpose, dawg, tell me what's your purpose, dawg?
Hidden agendas, niggas hoes, they be purpin', dawg
They be so fuckin' fraud, I'm a fuckin' star
I'ma keep hustlin', ain't gon' stop until we all ball

[Verse 2]
My name buzzin', that fame comin'
I feel this music in my veins, cousin
I'm grindin' for my mothafuckin' family
I wanna buy my mom a house in Beverly Hills
A million cash, would you kill for it?
I'm a million cash, my niggas, they gon' kill for me
Don't wanna see my momma cryin' 'bout no bill money
Fuck all this petty shit, let's get some real money
Nike Cortez', yeah they fresh up out the box
I ain't takin' these off 'til it's a hundred in that box
I see death around the corner, woah, R.I.P. to Pac
I see the niggas who killed my daddy, it's gon' be a world war
Choppas singin' at their throat, it's gon' be like, "Ooh la la"
I'ma keep on grindin' until I'm on world tour
I can't let these niggas play me, gotta do it on my own
I'm responsible for makin' sure that all my people on

[Outro]
Gotta get, gotta get, gotta get my family off them corners
I've been grindin' for so long, it's 'bout to pay off
I'ma make it, you can put that on my father
I'ma make a mil and spend it on my mama[Verse 1]
Hands down, me and my niggas gettin' bread now, yea now
Basquiat paintings on my wall
Shrimp and champagne is what I order
God sent them angels and they saved me
Sell Sole, Shots fired off safety
Pockets golden, they finna know me
The realest in it, Lord protect me and my homies
These niggas love me, your nigga spoil me
I'm nothing like these other girls, they corny
Ya'll be shootin' but don't be scorin'
We be shootin',  yea we be ballin'
Ain't gone and tell 'em who fuckin' run it
Runnin' marathons around all these dummies
I'm at the top, don't want no comp
All these sacrifices got me lookin' lucky
They say I'm ugly
But they don't know me
I'm goin' crazy cause I really came from nothin'

[Hook]x2
And I say, hands down, me and my niggas gettin' bread now
Yeah now, walkin' with my head up, not my head down
Yeah now, haters gon' talk, we gon' lay 'em down
Killin' everything we see, no time to play around

[Verse 2]
Protecting my people, all these weapons are lethal
In the studio grindin', tryna ice out my Jesus
Feel this shit in my soul, feel it all through them speakers
Hey yo, my heart done turned cold, I can see through you people
I be turnin' down features, I'm bout to turn up my prices
All my verses worth millions but I'm taking 10 thousand
They wanted heat, I LeBron'ed 'em
They wanted beef? I surprise them
Cause I've been cooking all this shit
Now time to eat and live righteous

[Hook]x2

[Verse 3]
Dad killed, rose petals, mom's missin'
95, brother born, cold winter
Shit crazy, all these women and all these children
Supposedly I got new brothers and new sisters
Stay to myself, I was the oddball
Hoop dreams, I had the handles like hot sauce
But being shy was my downfall
Couldn't let that shit control my life dog

[Hook]x2[Hook: Dej Loaf] x4
I ain't got time cause I run these streets
My money too long, why you hatin' on me?
I be on my grind and I run these streets
So it's about time that I flood these streets

[Verse 1: Young Klep]
Spent about a band on my Louis evidence
Cause it's evident a nigga gettin' hella rich
All that Instagram shit'll get your melon split
Slide through, drop a hundred, let the candy drip
I'm on some Kevin Gates shit, I don't get tipsy
On the floor late night tryna get mine
Stay down and come up, ain't got no new friends
Now I'm racked up, Forgiatos on a new Benz
Weed loud, I can show you what the pack do
If you a nerd, I can show you what the MAC do
I bring it back like I'm Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne
Copped the old school with this candy on some gold thangs

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: Young Klep]
Broke niggas talkin', I call it EBT
Government funded niggas that can't fuck with me
I'm in that 600, on some Forgiato
Strap tucked, sippin' syrup out a baby bottle
You call yourself a boss but I don't understand
Your circle lookin' bummy, why you ain't front your men?
You niggas dead wrong, my whole team on
Back and forth, catchin' plays like it's ping pong
I let my nuts hang cause I done took some losses
Game strong cause I done hung around too many bosses
I ain't forgot my nigga [?], he put me on
Now it's thousand dollar plays, juugin' on the iPhone

All my niggas throw them 4s up
This ain't a game, watch all my niggas load up
I don't smoke, but baby roll up
Henny cups on all that ice, bitch I'm froze up
All these lames keep talkin' like they know us
Fake rappers, we'll pull you off your tour bus
I don't wanna do no songs or do no features with 'em
I ain't no groupie, I don't wanna take no pictures either
I'm glad I bossed up all my old hoes
Comment on my pictures like they're happy for me, no sir
And your main bitch ain't fuckin' with me
Tell a nigga like boss up, come get this money with me
Dej Loaf, bitch I'm self made
IBGM, come get signed, bitch I'm self paid
I said I made myself a boss
Money in the mattress, we got bricks all in the loft

Why would she be spazzin'? Actin' like an asshole

Get you gone for a dub before I take a loss
Free my niggas, they touch down, yo we takin' off
I can't believe they took my daddy from me
20 years, I just went and got him tatted on me
Catch them pussies, we gon' spazz all on 'em
I ain't forgivin' 'em, they fucked up my family, homie
Bow, to the head
Lord forgive me, let us bow our heads
I'm just lookin' in the sky line
It's after labor day, she still got on all white
Watch them haters, they be lookin' out their side eye
All black, we in them coupes, it's a drive by
You only lie when you fear, that's why I don't lie
Cause at the end of the day we all gotta die
Someway, somehow
That's why I laugh, and I smile

What up, family?
Tryna wake 'em up cousin
I say R.I.P. to my cousin
Tryna wake 'em up cousin

[Verse 1]
Walking devil, I be feeling like Jesus
I don't know much about that Bible, never felt like I need it
I told my mom that I got her, when I make it we even
For all the years she took care of me and my brothers believin'
I miss my grandma, why did she have to leave me?
I had so much shit to tell her, damn man, I still can't believe it
We balling out, nah, we ain't up in no bleachers
You hear my songs on the radio, baby, turn up yours speakers
Cause we own now and we grown now
First million, go and tell 'em it's on now
I still sip Arizonas
And I do this shit for all of my loners
Screaming to the top of my lungs like "Mama, I'mma make it"
Gotta speak it to existence then you gotta have patience
Just stay in your lane, fuck anybody hatin'
Love don't love nobody so don't worry about datin'
Just worry about Dej whether you singing or you rappin'
All these bitches got opinions
Cause you fucking over half 'em
Anybody want war it ain't shit to get it crackin'
Cause nigga where I'm from they use alleys for the caskets
I'm not tryna promote violence, a lot of shit be on my conscience
Never been baptized, I got demons in my body
And I pray from time to time, I be like "Lord, get 'em off me"
I just want to be wealthy, way more to it than money
Don't nobody keep it real, half these rappers is phony
They ain't really getting money, pockets flat as my stomach
I don't merge in niggas' lanes, I got tunnel vision
Fuck a buffalo stud no pun intended
It's so hard, I still play it like Pun existed (Big Pun)
Teach the kids to be bosses, no dumb decisions
Look, all y'all fraud niggas, all y'all broad niggas
And most of 'em foul, that's exactly why I charge bitches
My niggas put up buckets, pour some soul with it
You got a team full of ball hoggers and soft niggas
Scared to let your mans ball, these niggas Ken dolls
I'mma put me on then put my friends off
Niggas try to talk to me, I put 'em in that friend zone
Sophisticated thug, you know the suit, ties, the Timbs on
We be off the Hen-dog, don't chase it for nothing
And you be on that bullshit, basically fronting
I'm basically running, anything go in front me
Try to stop me, I go crazy, I get to clicking and dumping
I probably leave a nigga boiling like chickens and dumplings
Cornbread, cabbage, soul food, I'll blow up your muffin
Fuck it, all I want is checks with them commas with no drama
Respect, loyalty, money and power
Round table, we gon' eat like them mobsters
I'm a monster, this music shit it come so easy, I got it
Bitch, I got it, oh, I got it
Bitch I got it
It come so easy, I got it
I got it
IBGM
Yeah, we got it, we got it
