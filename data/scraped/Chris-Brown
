Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down

Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh

[Hook: Chris Brown]
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
You know how a nigga feel 'bout wasting time
You know how I feel about waiting in line
You know he ain't it, girl you're wasting your time
You'll only ditch him for a moment in time, take it in stride
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

How many times I gotta tell your ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell you I gotta chauffeur?
Think about it, think it over, everything is gon' be kosher
Call me when you getting closer
If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick deserve recognition

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay phone off the hook, yeah that bitch won't stop blinking
I'll pick up for you though on the second ring
You've been drinking and drinking, you're drinking for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leaving
Calling shots refereeing, no drama
Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favourite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks

(I'll make him do it, I'll make him do it)[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake,worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)

I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about, your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is brazy my nigga, I been praising, my nigga
That money talk; I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the 'B' off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully, with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me

And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fucking bitches three ways
7 different foreigns plus she no hablé
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Looking in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'mma eat it, I'mma eat it
I don't lie, hope my dick's, too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend
But don't be acting like I need you cause we poppin' like

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm in a Rolls, you don't roll right
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fucking
Money, decision-making only worried about stunting
She worried about me, her nigga worried about cuffing
I wanna see her body (bodyyyy)
She said get inside of me
I wanna feel you baby (yeahhh)
Just bring the animal right out of me
We loving, she love it
Specially when I go down on her
Now we fucking, she thugging
Getting loud (cause we poppin' like)

Huh, look, alright

Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
(Uh, you losing money, I win mills, Dr. J
She going to follow my lead, Simon Says)
Paper, paper, I'm riding Scrapers in California
Car smelling like ammonia, we got that stank on us
(Never been an Outkast that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia)
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians
(And my section less niggas, more lesbians)
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga

I'm the one that when you round your friends that you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Yays going
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase

Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya

With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya

I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times

Everywhere I go these hoes be digging in they purses for a Sharpie
Cause they tryna get the autograph in cursive
Little bit of Coke mixed with a lot of bourbon
Got your boy leaning, sorry if my words slurring
Swerving in that DB9 on purpose
The roof disappear, call it magic like Earvin Johnson
Get up off my johnson, no more riding dick
Shawty this ain't magic mountain
I've been killing, killing every song that I been spitting on
And if I ain't spitting, better something that I written on
Can't even say it was a long road getting on
Only took a year and a half and now I'm shitting on

[Chorus]
Get it how I live it, come faster than I could spend it
Money to the ceiling, bitch I'm in the building

Skinny ass niggers pockets looking so bulimic
And I never spill my drink, you can call me Tempur-Pedic
Allergic to the haters, addicted to the money
You watching while I'm laughing cause all of you niggas funny
And they call me Action Jackson cause every day I'm stunting
And I'm writing hit songs like it's nothing
So nigga you bugging, fronting, what you think this is ho?
Paparazzi tryna pop me everywhere that Chris go

All up in that VIP, that shit look like a cloud
Guess Aladdin got 200 Jasmines coming to the house
And we banging on that magic carpet, fucking on the couch
All that fettucini say she saw a genie that’s that loud
They say silence is golden, so my chain don’t make a sound
But these bottles I’m holding, I’mm give them to the crowd
Oh, that must be that shit they talking ’bout

With two-hundred bad models

[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
A hundred fucking bottles, I wanna fuck a model
I got her on Patron, she open like a novel
I told her make it wobble while I grab her from behind
Then she made it wind so I ordered some Moscato
A couple hookers and a bucket of that Rose
We up in this bitch, niggas grilling like chipotle
Twenty bottles waters, cranberry and some OJ
Throw that money in the air, watch it fall like a snow flake
I smell like Kush and Dolce
I'm on that gin & juice and I'm feeling like the old Dre
I'll be lying if I said I wasn't drunk
It feels like I smoked a hundred blunts
And I ordered like

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh my god waiter
We packed up in this bitch
And I'm feeling the hater vapors, yeah it's hot up in this bitch!
But boy you will never phase me
And I know why you hate me
Cause my fucking cleaning lady
Look hotter than your bitch
And you know I'm about to spend
A hundred racks up in this bar, bar
You don't wanna drink you wanna be noisy Mrs.Aard-Vark
And I know that you not used to rejection
But if you don't get naked get the fuck up out my section!

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
You know I do it the biggest
Got these bitch niggas hating
Got these bad bitches jizzing
Holdin' down my city, but I picked up that commission
Boy, I run my city so you might need my permission
I'm just champagne pissing? Drink it till I might drown
Seen her in a wedding dress, I've seen her in her night gown
Will she take me out to eat, while you'll be trying to eat her out
Got a hundred fucking bottles boing with my weiner out
Damn right, I got a hundred fucking bottles

[Hook: Chris Brown] x2[Intro]

Welcome to the cypher
Myself, K-mac, Ace Hood, Tyga
It's the cypher, let's go

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Moment of silence for this beat that I'm about to kill
And all you rappers signed a suicidal deal
No hard feelings pimpin', it's what authentic is
Month old denims thirty grand in the steel
Sleepin' on me I put gas in your Nyquil
Gettin' money while your pockets on the diet pill
Flow knock 'em cold out like Benadryl
Glock cold fourteen, call it Emmett Till
Yea, billionaire it's a state of mind
Thats the rollie on thankful for these good times
Michael Corleone back when he was in his prime
Thats how I'm feelin' while I'm fuckin' my new Spanish dime
Damn, and you can tell I'm on another level
He think he better then I? He get the J letter
Yeah jumped in jack be a trend setter
You lookin' at the best how you doin', it's a pleasure

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I'm at the top like high note
Killin' for survival
Jeffery Dahmer - I'mma slaughter every beat that I'm on
Ya'll was sleepin' on me so I had to turn the lights on
My pockets swollen, I should put some ice on it
Shout to Breezy coulda never did this shit alone
Like potty training, coulda never did this shit alone
If we ain't the best to do this, then this shit was wrong
Sicker than HIV I guess that means I'm full-blown
And of course I'm speaking metaphorically
Livin' Fantastic I wonder if there's Four of me
This is just a sample so if you want more of me
You have to rewind time unless the microphone recordin' me
K-Mac rhymin' on the payback, the truth will set you free so I'mma testify and say that
Ballin' like a preacher catch me rollin' in my Maybach
Shinin' cause I blew myself up, Arab

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Look at me now, my dogs said we gon' be rich one day
But I'm Anfernee, I did things the Hardaway
Easy Bake, fast cake, Rearrange your vertebra
Try like a murder case, you gon' need ice gates
Thin ice, I be icier than a winter lake
Oh you, copied my swag, well you a little late
Prolly make more when I'm gone, Mike J
Smooth Criminal, sweet bass I call it Shawtay
Why you starin' so long, what your eyes gay
Money talk so I just walk and let it translate
You ain't fuckin' with me I don't fornicate
I just let her taste-test than I let my kids chase
Young Money Cash Money dollars, big face
So when you talk new rappers don't compare me
I'mma last king we don't talk rappers if it ain't YMCMB

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
They said I was down for the count let's make them eat they words
And if it's beef well sweet I make them bite the curb
This probation got me walkin' on the straight and narrow
I'm takin' shots in the club just likes it's double barrel
Come on live through what I been through
This media so fucked up that's why I don't do interviews
And I ain't gotta break shit but I bend the rules
Skateboard kick-flip right in my pool
With two hundred model chicks super gettin' loose
They just wanna big dick did I say that, Opps
Ha, oh my, oh my where's my manners
Pardon me for this grammar, this Virginia country grammar
Going nuts like some Planter's, and my chain feel like an anchor
When I told you to use your head but I ain't want you to be no thinker
Fresher than a mothafucka yeah you got yo stank up
Yeah swallow your pride, yeah go head and drank up[Intro]
Faire l'amour lendemain

[Verse 1]
What if the sky was turning red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, laying face to face
Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we finish
Girl we gon'

[Chorus]
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down

[Verse 2]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering cause we're covered in sweat
And girl I like the way it opens up, when you throw it back babe
Girl it might be too much, oh babe if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do it like we only got one, baby let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time and do it to you right
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down, but that won't stop me from turning that thing around, girl yeah
Won't you come on over and we can treat it like it's the motherfucking end of the world?

[Chorus]
And they depending on us
To make Earth shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down

[Outro]
A nigga going hard in the paint, you think I can?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can?
Going for miles, no stops, a nigga going hard in the paint

[Hook][Chris Brown]
Shattered glasses and cigarettes
There's a lot built up inside of me
I have so many regrets, this isn't how things used to be
You're never satisfied
Guess what? I'll stop fuckin trying
You suck
In case you didn't know, you're horrible
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
And I always go to war with you and I lose
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like Deja Vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Hook - Chris Brown]
You're way too complicated
I can no longer take it
We're no good, let's just face it
Cause you're way too complicated

[Chris Brown]
You're such a snobby girl, used to think you were a queen
Damn, sure did rain on my parade
Same old silly games you play, this is such a waste of time
Starting to think that you're insane - cukoo cukoo!
But it's always true, I'm always wrong anything I do
I'm a silly dude cause I keep coming back to you
This is feeling like Deja Vu
My head's spinning around and you got me saying

[Hook]

[Asher Roth]
I'm not sure, what else can I do?
I've had enough of your truths

Figure you wild, I'm sick of your mouth

No mathematician, take the digits and bounce
You got me screaming out[Verse 1: Chris Brown]

Niggas talk tough but they don’t want it though
Confront it to your face and then I’ll tell your man that he a ho
Bow Wizzle, I'm as real as it get

Counting all this money, all these bottles we popping
In a club with the models, got so many options
Nigga talk your shit, yeah they hate me, they watching
They know my flow ill, I be spitting and hulking, yikes
At 15 the Bentley was just a kid’s dream, now these cuffed links got me speaking like I'm European
A hundred thousand packed at the show in Manila
Then I'm down in Africa where the kids are the killers
Got a mind of a king but a heart of a gorilla, you can imitate but ain't nobody realer

[Verse 4: Bow Wow]
Yeah I'm counting all this money, milli for the Bugatti
And my girl ass thick like Buffy the body
And which one I'mma choose, I think her with the booze

You know I'm smoking on the finest, G5 to the islands
I’m too fly yeah it’s like I’m on autopilot
Man stop it I'm way outta your league, see it'll take a lifetime to spend all this cheese

[Verse 1]
Black shades, dark tint
Your girl, nigga I get it in
Stick shifting, switching and burning out in the Benz
Wood gripping, kissing all of they model friends
Mr. Dolo, with a bunch of freaks
And you know they get the party bouncing like a pogo
I'm in slow mo
But fast forward me to the part where me and your girl underneath the sheets
Just keep your eyes on
Got a whole bunch of niggas behind me wearing red, Verizon
New money, I get my super size on
I like a long hair, bad chick, thighs long
Knowing all the words to my songs
And she fucking every girl that's on my phone
I'm, I'm so fly
Flight models up cause I'm so high
Lil nigga get your cheese up
Black Ice on my neck, make you freeze up
Oh you worry about me, go figure
I ain't sweating it, fuck them old niggas
Lambo, Range Rove, with my pants low
I got the audience clapping like a backboard
She put her hands up, and then I stand up
And get to working on the pole like a dancer
I double up, I call it double Dutch
Two girls at the same time, what the fuck?
Rabbit foot in the air cause my luck is up
Bring the first aid out, cause I'm cutting up
Bang bang, now that's some G shit
No chain gang, like I'm really on some free shit
They jaw dropped, I'm leaving niggas speechless
World premier, get a sneak peek bitch
I'm great, today is a new day
Fucking with me, do the moon walk on your face
No games, I'm oh so serious
And y'all niggas straight pussy, period
They say a singer can't rap, I ain't hearing it
Cause after these couple songs I been killing shit
Oh no, niggas saying I'm loco
But they Pinocchio niggas, watch their nose grow
It's Young Money, shoutout my nigga Tyga too
They on their first mixtape, I'm on volume two
Turn me up, I'll show you what a tiger do
And I'mma rip this beat up like lion food
Louis luggage and the case for the passport
I don't buy shit, nigga I ask for it
I'm the freshest, I'm the best
I suggest that I get it off my motherfucking chest, Breezy[Verse 1]
I got money, everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing?

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm 4 years old all over again
Cause I'm just running fast and should be walking
Saying when I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy

[Verse 2]
I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm so alone, I feel so alone, so alone in this world
Got everything I want

[Chorus][Hook: Asher Roth]
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

Go go [x4]

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
Here I go
Yeah yo, what's the scenario?
Can't understand, what you staring for?
Like you've never seen a white boy dance before
But damn she fine
That's one chick I can stand behind
Play in my field like a dandelion
Put it all on 'til you can't decide
What's it gon' be?
You, me, her, her, her, you, me
Girl, go beserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree
Go ahead, fall back, [?] boy gon' breathe
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Floating, sipping, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up, acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Hook: Asher Roth]

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo
Checking my fresh, everything brand new
Sexy old dude, saying "who's you?"
You do me, and I'mma do you
What what, what you talkin about Willis?
Man fall back, I'm just chillin'
Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch
Gotta have respect for my bad habits
P-p, now pass me the tree
I'mma get wild, I'mma nail you to me
Pull out the camera and shoot me a links
Cause I'mma act up, sweetie pie, what you think?
Go insane in the membrane, [?]
[?] slang, come and hang with a real name

Badder than a m-, MJ level
Face down, ass up, skinnys on, dirty Chucks
Showing off, I'mma swag it up
Good girl gone bad, grab my bud

[Hook: Asher Roth]

Cause I'm so so fly, yeah I'm so fly
And I don't know why, really know I, go so wow, till the bass goes oh my
Oh I, I gotta slow it down
Yeah I'm on the loose, and I won't stop now
Cause I go so loud, and I go so wow
So you better watch out cause I’m oh so ahh
I’m on some risky business
I like women and French kisses
Mama told do the dishes but I'm here catching fishes
Cause I'm still young and acting up
Girls on my mind, so I still mack up
They see the money, see the money, rack up, till the walls dark green, cause I'm stacking up
Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fu--
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
Yikes, I guess I'm actin' up
I'm about to go in, let me wrap it up
Young old school like Galaga
But I'mma call these shots, caliber
What it is JB, my Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies
My chain heavy, give it to the ladies
Hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy
Chilling with Asher Roth
Girls let me touch, cause their ass is soft
Yes I'mma score with them basketballs
She gon' give it up, I don't pass at all
My crew neck match my two-step
I just had group sex on my new jet
So many pretty girl, I'm like "who's next?"
So drunk all my white friends like, "Do it!"
Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up
Smoking, drinking, having fun, cause I be young and acting up
Acting, acting up
Acting, acting up
They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

[Hook: Asher Roth][Verse 1]
Your body's an isosceles
And I'm just tryna try angles
Your love is trigonometry
Just tryna solve the whole equation

[Pre-Hook]
What's it about you (about you)
I wanna love you
Figure it out, figure it out
So I can touch you
Should we do that? Can I do that? (baby)
Answers are usually in the back

[Hook]
Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love
Is that too much?
Substitution
What's the problem, girl?
Add me in

[Bridge 1]
Baby just add me, baby just add me in
Baby just add me, baby just add me in

Divide your legs and count to 3 (3,2,1, come on)
He's just not the answer baby
And that's just my hypothesis (real talk girl)

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
What if I said I loved you (love you baby), I need you
Would you care?
So many things that I could learn
And baby if we do the math, it will equal up to me instead of him

[Hook] [x2]

[Bridge 1] [x2][Intro:]
Ay, can I talk to you for a minute?

Ain't no way (ain't no way)

To say yes to me

But I'm gone make you say you love me
The way (girl the way), you look to me now (to me now)
We need to get down (let's get down)
You don't know but
I'm gone make you say you love me girl

[Verse 1:]
I ain't never fell for a girl like you (like you)
With jeans and a body that curves like you (like you)
I don't really care what they say, when it comes to a difference of age
I can show you all the things I'll do
Break your heart, never raise my voice
Girl let down your guard
I know it's a lot to ask trust in me, but I can make a difference right now you'll see
Shorty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me
Everytime you walk pass
Oh

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
For a minute can you just think about us two?
Swerving in my 645 SU, me leaning over the seat
I'm passing you your own set of keys, showing you just how the teen got you
Trust and believe these words, from me been said before
Tricking ain't my M-O.But girl you represent everything
That Chris is about so shawty please
Shawty tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me
Everytime you walk pass,oh

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
For you girl, I'll buy you anything
Just to have you close to me
Cause you know ya loving is off the wall

[Hook:][Intro - Bow Wow]
Hey Chris. Hey man
You know it's been a long time you know since we hooked up and did something, real, you know
For the ladies, ya dig that
Oh yeah! You know we! You know we! You know we do it for the ladies!

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
I got a couple of girls on call; I'mma a bring em out
A Magic City stripper, huh, so this what this all about?
I'm in the club doing my two step
I pulled about eight broads already, I'm just getting my feet wet
But I ain't even knocking your style
Cause I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Oooh, see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
But little do you know, you making yourself look bad
If dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
See it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better get your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo, Bow!

[Hook - Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turned up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)
(aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)
(I said girl I ain't trippin', tonight I' goin' out with my niggas)

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown]
We don' been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
You callin' me a player, but a nigga ain't trippin'
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My Blackberry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
You don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like
But I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one
All the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[Hook]

[Bridge - Bow Wow]
I told her, I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas' (my niggas)
Hey (hey), I said, 'Girl I ain't trippin
Tonight I'm goin out with my niggas man'

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
I'm bein' honest, listen shawty, I don't want you no more
So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door
Cause you losin', and she choosin'
And like Chris said I'm chunkin' up the deuces
On to the next one. All I ask is keep it real
Couldn't do that; so I'mma tell you how I feel
I'm poppin' bottles all night
Cause that black card ain't got no limit alright

[Hook][Intro: Chris Brown]
It's like I can't let you go (on tonight)
But I got to (on tonight)
I'm a change it up a little bit, I'm a do it like this

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
We don been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
She gotta ball player, but a nigga ain't tripping
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My blackberry filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
Yeah you don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like but I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one, all the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us

[Chris Brown]
Shawty wassup
Oh baby
All the girls in the club (God damn, you sexy)
You sexy, God damn you sexy
Oh you sexy, ohhhhhh

[Hook][Verse 1]
How'd did you get so young, I heard that you were born today
Heard that you came from the sky and I just wanna say
Welcome, the world is glad you're here to stay, have fun, it's time to give another day
Sometimes the fire can get in your way, but that ain't nothing, you can't blow away

[Chorus]
So make a wish, I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you, it's all about you today, today
It's all about you
It's all about you, today, today

[Verse 2]
Girl what do you want, I swear I'll give you everything
New car parked out front, flowers, bags and wedding rings
Well done, the world is glad you're here to stay, have fun, it's time to give another day
Sometimes the fire get in the way, but that ain't nothing, you can't blow away

[Chorus]
So make a wish, I have one too
I wish that I could stay with you
Wish you knew how much I want all your wishes to come true
It's all about you, it's all about you today, today
It's all about you
It's all about you, today[Verse 1]
If I had the moment, I'd capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I had the secret, the secret to your love
I would place the treasure beneath my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Lock it all up and throw away the key
I would never give it up
Cause I was just a fool, a fool for you
When I loved you so childishly

[Chorus]
And I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all girl I want it all back
I want it all back, I want it all, I want it all, girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all

[Verse 2]
If there is a green light and it starts to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just a fool, a fool for you
That didn't know what I had until I lost you
Every single moment that you’re not here
It's evident to me that everything just seems so clear

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now everything isn't everything
If everything, everything isn't with you, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
She is from the west side shawty on her best side
Little bit of [?] with her [?]

Plus 5 plus 5 she was dead fine
Go to sleep all in it like nap time
She woke up like this, with her ass all on me from the backside
She wanted to the surf board just trying to be like Beyonce
And if she always do it this good then she might just be my finace

I think she in love with me cause that watch up on her say love o' clock
I want more I want more [?] out on tour
We go to Paris then go to the store
She was on paper it [?]
We fell in love and we was for sure

[Hook: Chris Brown]

All I want is you all I want is you baby
