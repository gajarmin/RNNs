[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time everywhere I go
And even in my dreams I can scheme a way to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that?
Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats
I tell em "scat, skittle, scabobble"
Got hit with a bottle
And I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame when you living in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together
Right? So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand-new car
So far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flatAnd do you really wanna know what's really whack?
See I can't even get a date, so, what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really though, I 'm a Figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well, then I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies "look alive"
Cause it's hard to survive when your living
In a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Makes me say "my, my, my"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
Cause everyday would be a Friday
And you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should know just how I feelCause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you , what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like thatYeah

The other day I was cruisin' the shaw I seen Jay
The big homey from Oakland runs the bay
I used to be in love wit his sister back in the day
Had to holler at him see what he had to say
It's good to see him now and know that he's ok
He asked how I was doin' and then proceeded to say
What happened to the record, what's up wit the air-play
Politics too many haters is in the way
It's ok now but really it's no excuse
I can tell you how it all went down but what's the use
It's a lot of people walkin' around wit there tounges loose
And I don't care what nobody tell you I got juice
Takin' it day by day, do or die
Hustlin', imagine this game wit I
Did you think I would just lay back and not try
I'ma bounce back, get on my feet, get on my hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
It depends on how much in this life you wanna see
And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo ]
Do the math focus and stay on the right path
Forget about the busters and snitches that all laugh
You know people when they see money they wanna grab
Greed, how much money you wanna have
Stay away from criminal act and crack labs
Quick money ain't no money it turns bad
Trust god make him the only friend you have
Instead of short brothers wit tempers that get mad
Whenever there's somebody that's tryin' to limit you tho'
Downin' you tellin' you places you can't go
You got to have faith in yourself you gotta show
Their opinions really ain't worth nothing they don't know
It's a whole lotta player involved you ain't seen
That ain't been half the places that you been
I'm tellin' you all you brothers that want cream
Bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
It depends on how much in this life you wanna see
And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo ]
Will you go to the top, will you settle for crumbs
I hope you ain't none of these brothers that act dumb
Never learned to chill and relax and have fun
Steady livin' life in the shade wit no sun
You got to learn to deal wit your problems you can't run
How you gonna ever advance to number one
And settle for number two that's something I can't feel
Got bein' broke mixed up wit bein' real
Keep it real brothers, stay on your feet, get on your hustle
If you can do it without force use muscle
Walk soft carry a stick ready to tussle
Your friends really ain't your friends and don't trust you
Wait for the day that you fall and hope and pray
You probably owe some of them money and can't pay
And you wanna know what I do think what do I say
Bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
It depends on how much in this life you wanna see
And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle manCrenshaw on Sunday night

Yeah, Skee-Lo, tights
When the vibe is right

[Hook]
You see, I found a love and it feels strange
And I don’t know your name and all I wanna know is
Can you be my love?
And I know you feel the way and trust me, I feel the same
That's when the vibe is right (Yeah, yeah, that's when the vibe is right)
Vibe is right

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, I can feel your vibe
Makes me want to thrive
So amazing how you make a brother feel alive
I don’t really have a girl, I was telling lies
Hanging with the guys I was only talking jive
I apologize, you the only one I need
I just want to make you happy but I can’t cope
Kind of difficult to be, kind of difficult to see who we are
So I hope to start a conversation, she’s Haitian
I’m from the nation, we can take a vacation in fact
Meet up at the local train station in fact
Wait here 'till a brother get back
Or you can call me, baby, this is all me, you can even stall me if you got to
Sleeping with a bunch of niggas if you want to
But don’t you, cause you’re much too smart for that
I can feel your vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, when the vibe is right
I’m the liveliest, right?
Hit the boulevard and we can go dancing
Come here, baby, let me show you what I’m feeling
You the only woman that I see in the building
You know you make a brother want to hit the ceiling
You want to have children? I’m willing to get married
Go to Can Cujn, picture you & me we at our honeymoon, Bell-Cap
Room service, she’s nervous
Come here, baby, let me show you what a birth is
I know I’m moving at a thousand thirty-seven and a third like the earth is
You can just call me, baby this is all me, you can even stall me if you got to
Mess around and stay single if you want to
But don’t you, cause you’re much too smart for that
I can feel your vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, even through the hard times
If I’m doing hard time or I’m working part time for a year or so
I get back on the grind, cause you stay on my mind
Even through the hard times I ain’t hearing no rumors
You and him, me and her, never did occur, I just want to be with you
Never really felt something as real as this
I just really want to see it through
I’m at 4522 Colfax, block from the Wal-Mart by the train tracks
Right where the hoods and the thugs hang at
But you can come through and relax
Baby jump to it, I’m going to do it
Find me a hell of a woman, that’s what you is
Never met a woman strong as you, I’m gone with you
I can get along with you, I’m feeling your vibe

[Hook]"If you don't mind (if you don't mind)
We'd like to play somethin (play somethin)"

(Skee-Lo)
Gloria, pick up I know your there stop frontin just pick up
Aight look, look I know I messed up
But check it out just listen

(Skee-Lo)
I'm leavin you this message spotly cause I miss you
I didn't mean to diss you but sometimes I slip, ya got me
Stumblin over boulders lookin over my shoulders
Hopin you're behind me but the sun blinds my vision
No competiton cause I'm wishin and hopin
That we could go to Canada, and Ann Lee lopin but nopin
I know you caught playin with your heart
Shoulda known that I was up to no good from the start
Little hoodrat who's that guy I saw you walkin with
Talkin with actin like he's wit ya
Just like 2 Pac you know "I get around"
But I didn't mean to get around with your little sister
Think I was lookin for your friend so let me try again
To prove myself cause I don't want nobody else
It's been 7 hours and 16 days since you took your love away
So I just want to say that you should

(Chorus: Skee-Lo)
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me

(Skee-Lo)
Oh stacker, cracker I'm the one who's badder
1 step 2 step 3 step 4
Oh are you sure that you really want to leave me
I tell you that I love you but I don't think you believe me
I never meant you any wrong my dear
Besides yo you can't believe everything you hear
So just like Stevie "I Wonder" is there water all under the bridge
It's thrillin but lately I've had this strangest feelin like Jodeci
I'm goin through the emotions so baby won't you just stay OK!
I'm tryin to get you offa my mind but you just won't go away
In fact just the other day I was coolin at a party on a Friday
Doin things my way chillin with my cousin Shareef
A girl walks my way couldn't say get away
Cause then again it goes against my Islamic believes
So I'm a big game to get to know the honeys name
Cause you know that I was lookin for a real good time
She was fine so I kicked a few lines
But I couldn't get ya out my mind, get ya out of my mind, so

(Chorus: Skee-Lo)
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come baaaaaaaaaccckk!

(Skee-Lo)
All the real good ships of lollypops
Stop for a second and listen to ya heart
And if ya still say no then I'm gonna have to let you go with it
And wave goodbye and give one last cry
Cause I'm not goin to take it no more so don't do that
Can't keep breakin my heart so don't pursue that
Time has been wasted time has been spent
Pain is the essence but not my intent
So gaze through the woods and stop through the meadows
Cause I love Lucy like Bill love Jello
And if you ever change your mind one day
Then you know where I stay just a block away
And I wait for you to

(Chorus: Skee-Lo)
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccckk!

That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together
Right? So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand-new car
So far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flatAnd do you really wanna know what's really whack?
See I can't even get a date, so, what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really though, I 'm a Figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well, then I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies "look alive"
Cause it's hard to survive when your living
In a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Makes me say "my, my, my"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
Cause everyday would be a Friday
And you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should know just how I feelCause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you , what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like thatYeah

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time
Everywhere I go, and even in my dreams
I can scheme a way to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that
Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls
And me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle
And I been in the hospital
For talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame when you livin' in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together
Right?
So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

Growin up as a kid tough skins and Afros
Wasn't South Central, but still it came natural
There wasn't nobody to watch my back
Didn't wanna be strapped to get jacked
Mama taught me not to trust no man
Brother what's your plan?
If you ever lose a fight, then you go back again and win
And I don't care if it was one of your friends
You better bury your feelings within
And understand that on top of the stairs
They got keys to Catalacs BMW's Mercedes, Benz and all of that
And on top of the stairs yeah
They got colour TV's and even girls come in two pairs
And on the bottom you've got nothin but guilt
Bad feelings bein kept homies been killed
When I die always know that I never was see my little brother drop
So you better stay on top

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs

(Skee-Lo)
Little brother look around you, can't you see
All the possibilities and we, you and me
To the bang boogie up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogie to the beat, I'ma emcee
I spent three years in Mickey D's cleanin dishes
Half of that time was makin wishes
Want ya hit switches in a brand new six-fo'
But all I could afford was another nine and Roseau's Chicken and Waffles
How bout that Honda Cord
Used to watch drop by at night till I got bored
But not no more really that's for sure
Cause I gotta million honeys knockin on my door
And I'm not tryin to score with one
Cause diseases kill and that's ill
To make a mill in you gettin done
When you on top of the world girls may come
But when you fall down you won't find one

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs

(Skee-Lo)
Little brother this is all we got
Me and you will be cruel
Even though it doesn't seem like a lot, it is
So don't be thinkin negative
I know just how you feel when you got time to kill I'll tell you how it is
I know you might be unsure
Cause it gets rough out there and when it rains and pours
I stole shoes from stores hung out with cool cats
Put cars on flats broke windows with bats
And that's not all even made prank phone calls
I was flossin and sloshin in Fox Hills Mall (So whattup y'all?)
After all please check my credentials
I once got busy in the whenchles yeah
So throw your hands in the air
Wave em around if you've been treated unfair
Yeah cause no one cares (no one cares, no one cares)
Top of the stairs (top of the stairs, top of the stairs)

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs
Cause no one really cares about the guy on the bottom
No one really cares about the guy beneath
And everybody wants to be down with the dude
On top of the stairs, top of the stairs

(Skee-Lo)
Yeah to all my little brothers out there

Most importantly you better remember

[Young Money]
Get out, watch ya steps and the ol' bucksway

Fire tech-9 and we bust your car right

For me to knock niggas out the box daily[ Skee-Lo ]
The other day I was cruisin' the shaw I seen Jay
The big homey from Oakland runs the bay
I used to be in love wit his sister back in the day
Had to holler at him see what he had to say
It's good to see him now and know that he's ok
He asked how I was doin' and then proceeded to say
What happened to the record, what's up wit the air-play
Politics too many haters is in the way
It's ok now but really it's no excuse
I can tell you how it all went down but what's the use
It's a lot of people walkin' around wit there tounges loose
And I don't care what nobody tell you I got juice
Takin' it day by day, do or die
Hustlin', imagine this game wit I
Did you think I would just lay back and not try
I'ma bounce back, get on my feet, get on my hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
It depends on how much in this life you wanna see
And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo ]
Do the math focus and stay on the right path
Forget about the busters and snitches that all laugh
You know people when they see money they wanna grab
Greed, how much money you wanna have
Stay away from criminal act and crack labs
Quick money ain't no money it turns bad
Trust god make him the only friend you have
Instead of short brothers wit tempers that get mad
Whenever there's somebody that's tryin' to limit you tho'
Downin' you tellin' you places you can't go
You got to have faith in yourself you gotta show
Their opinions really ain't worth nothing they don't know
It's a whole lotta player involved you ain't seen
That ain't been half the places that you been
I'm tellin' you all you brothers that want cream
Bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
It depends on how much in this life you wanna see
And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo ]
Will you go to the top, will you settle for crumbs
I hope you ain't none of these brothers that act dumb
Never learned to chill and relax and have fun
Steady livin' life in the shade wit no sun
You got to learn to deal wit your problems you can't run
How you gonna ever advance to number one
And settle for number two that's something I can't feel
Got bein' broke mixed up wit bein' real
Keep it real brothers, stay on your feet, get on your hustle
If you can do it without force use muscle
Walk soft carry a stick ready to tussle
Your friends really ain't your friends and don't trust you
Wait for the day that you fall and hope and pray
You probably owe some of them money and can't pay
And you wanna know what I do think what do I say
Bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man

[ Skee-Lo (Chorus x2) ]
If you can go anywhere in this world where would it be
It depends on how much in this life you wanna see
And to get there can't be cheap it ain't free
Gotta bounce back, get on your feet, get on your hustle man"If you don't mind (if you don't mind)
We'd like to play somethin (play somethin)"

(Skee-Lo)
Gloria, pick up I know your there stop frontin just pick up
Aight look, look I know I messed up
But check it out just listen

(Skee-Lo)
I'm leavin you this message spotly cause I miss you
I didn't mean to diss you but sometimes I slip, ya got me
Stumblin over boulders lookin over my shoulders
Hopin you're behind me but the sun blinds my vision
No competiton cause I'm wishin and hopin
That we could go to Canada, and Ann Lee lopin but nopin
I know you caught playin with your heart
Shoulda known that I was up to no good from the start
Little hoodrat who's that guy I saw you walkin with
Talkin with actin like he's wit ya
Just like 2 Pac you know "I get around"
But I didn't mean to get around with your little sister
Think I was lookin for your friend so let me try again
To prove myself cause I don't want nobody else
It's been 7 hours and 16 days since you took your love away
So I just want to say that you should

(Chorus: Skee-Lo)
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me

(Skee-Lo)
Oh stacker, cracker I'm the one who's badder
1 step 2 step 3 step 4
Oh are you sure that you really want to leave me
I tell you that I love you but I don't think you believe me
I never meant you any wrong my dear
Besides yo you can't believe everything you hear
So just like Stevie "I Wonder" is there water all under the bridge
It's thrillin but lately I've had this strangest feelin like Jodeci
I'm goin through the emotions so baby won't you just stay OK!
I'm tryin to get you offa my mind but you just won't go away
In fact just the other day I was coolin at a party on a Friday
Doin things my way chillin with my cousin Shareef
A girl walks my way couldn't say get away
Cause then again it goes against my Islamic believes
So I'm a big game to get to know the honeys name
Cause you know that I was lookin for a real good time
She was fine so I kicked a few lines
But I couldn't get ya out my mind, get ya out of my mind, so

(Chorus: Skee-Lo)
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come baaaaaaaaaccckk!

(Skee-Lo)
All the real good ships of lollypops
Stop for a second and listen to ya heart
And if ya still say no then I'm gonna have to let you go with it
And wave goodbye and give one last cry
Cause I'm not goin to take it no more so don't do that
Can't keep breakin my heart so don't pursue that
Time has been wasted time has been spent
Pain is the essence but not my intent
So gaze through the woods and stop through the meadows
Cause I love Lucy like Bill love Jello
And if you ever change your mind one day
Then you know where I stay just a block away
And I wait for you to

(Chorus: Skee-Lo)
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Baby, baby please come baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccckk!

"Do you like the music, do you, do you like the music
Hey you ruined my record man I just bought it"[ Skee-Lo ]
We fall and we bounce back I bet you an ounce that
My lyrics make sense and the base line's phat
This life that I'm livin' is so sweet that
I'm constantly chased by millions of hoodrats
In the same room I see them all at one time
Yellin' Drew better get you a freak I got mine
And I know she probably be wit me in no time
Cause it's gold on my watch and money on my mind
Plus I'm rollin' a Lex that's on 20's
Serious about my sound so my amps be
Fillin' up most of the space that be empty
Don't want to take yo chick so don't tempt me
Can't get it out my head
This thought I had when I got out of bed
As I looked at the mirror at myself and said
Got to call Big Chris, Drewskee and Tez
See what's crackin' tonight

[ Kozii (Chorus 2x) ]
Do it tonight
All night
Let's get it started right

[ Drewskee ]
Sittin' in the casino surrounded by women
Up twenty thousand tryin' to cash in my winnings
Hennessey on the rocks got my head spinnin'
Baby see me count my money then she started grinnin'
Can I go wit you she said me and my friend
And I'm lookin' for Skee-Lo so we can tag team him
Call him on the celly phone, what's goin' on
Tonight's the night like Betty Wright
Let's get it on
I got two ladies say they really like your music
They say they not groupies but still they want to do me
You tell them that we ain't spendin' a dime
I ain't got to tell them nothing they still stuck in '99
Plus I'm not wastin' your time
What these freaks look like
Well, mines is tight but yours is fine
I'ma tell you one more time
You need to hit me back on the line
Let me know what's up for tonight

[ Kozii (Chorus) ]
Do it tonight
All night
Let's get it started right

[ Skee-Lo ]
Say Drew these brothers ain't done nothing new
And for everything they did we done done that too
Let them go ahead and stare skeeter don't care
I crush the player hater out of anybody in there
Even padlocks ain't safe from mattlock
You shouldn't have got me started I told you I can't stop
Makin' your heart drop, makin' you kids watch
I'll make you wanna party wit everyone on your block
Thinkin' you top notch you trippin' like hop schotch
My lyrics is blue prints two chicks on Bay Watch
For exposure, we get wet and smoke doja
Everybody know about Skee I gots flow I
Don't mess wit none of these women that's mintelosha
Everybody tryin' to get a sip of my Momosa

[ Kozii (Chorus) ]
Do it tonight
All night
Let's get it started right(Skee-Lo)
Bonsai and oh my
Yippee Kai yai yay
Hello, hello, hello
Hooray, hooray, hooray
I am here to interrupt your regular program
So hey man now don't you touch that dial
Unless we step in single file
Keep it pretty slowly
Cause you know I like to focus on the ease
And you can call me Skee if you please
So come on in, come on in
Come in and give a pound mix and mingle with your friends
Or just have a drink or just sit down
Get up stand up come on throw your hands up
If ya girl is throwin fronts then your brothers keep your chin up
Be cool with the flexin she's in the mood for sexin
You could pop the question but that's just my suggestion
And when the mood is right we can switch it off to candle light
But hold on to your girls cause if you don't well then I might
I know that you just might be in the mood-a
To want to shoot a spark into the dark
But this is just a start

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on

(Skee-Lo)
Thinkin back black yo I could remember that high school flame
Now was it Nikki or Lorraine yo what was her name
Anyway she was so cute that back at school I tried to rock it
But she often put her purse to any brothers tryin to knock it
So stop it to get with I got with
But what's this was honey just fakin it that kept me from my ducats
Now the rain has gone I can clearly see
What was we enemies?
Not for long alone is what she wants to be
But what am I to do, what am I do to?
What would you do if you were in the same shoes?
With a bunch of bad news from my hoodrat
Sorry but I gotta scatter I'm movin from the East to the West
So please say God Bless and oh yes see I miss her very much
I wish that I could give her my number so that she could stay in touch
I wonder if she remembers me and what went on
And if she does not understand word is born I'mma keep holdin on

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
(I'ma keep holdin' on)
I'll keep holdin' on

(Skee-Lo)
Well hello my honey ?dips?
See I'm back from my trip
All the letters you wrote I kept
Do you remember when I left?
I said, "I'm leavin on the next plane
Don't know when I'll be back again"
Kiss me, smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go my little trick-a-dee
Cause life is what you make as we take it as reality
Now we're reunited and it feels so good
You know were reunited and it feels so good
Through the centuries of time heal the rhymes and unwind
Melodies flowin swift with the jazz fill
Kill the lights move in closer to your loved ones
Baby hold em tight like tomorrow never comes
Gaze into the eyes sympathise not the sympathy
Me and Mrs Jones got a marriage going on understand me
Everything is dandy so what can be wrong
And if you now know the song then sing along

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on

Yeah!

[Intro/Chorus: Skee-Lo]
I wish I was little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
Wish I had a rabbit in a hat
With a bat and a six-four Impala

[Verse One: Skee-Lo]
I wish I was like 6'9, so I can get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
Even in my dreams I can scheme of ways to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin fat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that?
Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch they men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble
Got hit with a bottle, been in the hospital for talkin that mess
I confess it's a shame when you livin in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by the thoughts of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Verse Two: Skee-Lo]
I wish I had a brand new car, so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go yo I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really whack?
See I can't even get a date so what'chu think of that?
I heard that prom night is the bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really though, I'm a figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive
Cause it's hard to survive when you're livin
In the concrete jungle and these girls keep passin' me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say my, my, my

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[uncredited female vocalist]

[Verse Three: Skee-Lo!]
Heyyyy! I wish I had my way, cause every day would be a Friday
You could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games, name my kids ghetto names
Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck yhen you should know just how I feel
Cause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's goin down
Ahhhh, yes, ain't that fresh?
Now everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Skee-Lo]
Yeah!

[uncredited female vocalist - repeat 4X to fade/end]
You know, you know, you know Skee-Lo
Wish you were taller, wish you were a baller
Skee-Lo, you know, you know, you knowwww
Wish you were taller, wish you were a ballerYo, puttin' down, definition
Breakin' motherfuckers off proper like
And all y'all motherfuckers know what I mean

(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box daily

Get out, watch ya steps and the ol' bucksway
Fire sixteen and we bust an oozy
What side can we ride on, take off your sign or
Fire tech-9 and we bust your car right
Here's one, it bust louder than a normal gun
Here's one, fire one and fire on and on
Ambush, we have bush and we have tech psycho
Run by and rat tat tat at cha' and ya trucko

Bumptity bump is that shit that cha' get
When ya listenin' to the sounds of Da Brat (BABY!)
It's like that it's like that ain't no future in frontin'
So to avoid all that I keep bumpin' (AH NIGGA!)
I ain't no motherfucking joke (NIGGA!)
Step and get broke up loc
How I came in is how I'm goin' out (With a bang)
Puttin' it down, puttin' it down ain't no thang

(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
It's the ZZ, it's one to the two to the motherfucking three
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
Puttin' it down puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
(Ain't no thang, ain't no thang)
For me to knock niggas out the box dailyI used to think that I was hard
The kind of kid you don't wanna mess wit'
I'll fight you and your bodyguard
I was illeterate, we're talkin' gibberish
But never considerate of the way I treated friends
I would fight ten kids and I would fly all heads
I would even fight dragons 'til they'd be dead
I would presidents and the mayor, you bet
But it's just too bad because I ain't fought yet
You see, I took a slug at no one
But if I ever did, I'll have to show one
That I was like, able to wreck it
I thought I knew but I didn't know
That all the talk in the world doesn't make you a pro
And so, cause my first real fight in the hood
I would bash a skull, if I could
But that's when these kids wrecked my world, swept my feet up
Straight got illed and I was nearly killed
It never crossed my mind

[Chorus]
I could go ten different places at one time (all at one time)
I could jump through my ears and walk through my mind (walk through my mind)

I never thought that it could happen to you
I never thought that it could happen to me
But then it happend, see
Coolin' out, chillin' with my homeboy Paul
Now we was chillin', talkin' to ladies up inside of the mall
I got a few numbers and some girl's address
So I was feelin' kinda fly and I was dressed real fresh
We was coolin' as if we didn't care
He was too busy talkin', and so he wasn't aware
That's when he caught a slug to his chest
A hole in his vest, worst of all he made a mess all over the carpet
Started to tumble all over the place
Cause a bullet has no name, it sees no face
Anyways, this girl pulled a trigger on us
She was tryin' to kill the man who's next to the man
Who's next to the man...what?
And that's all he gots to give
He's ready to die, but I'm hopin' he lives
It never crossed his mind

[Chorus]

For my groupies, why must you do me?
You never knew me, so what makes you hot for me?
Is it fortune and fame just because of my name
You wanna tell your friends that you did it Skee
See, we can't be, because there is no us
You and I won't happen, so don't make no fuss
Now we could persist with a hug and a kiss
But I can't help but wonder "who's daughter is this?"
I'm glad you respect me, now let me respect you
If I was a dog, then I might want you
But if you want it that bad, then baby, don't get mad
Because you're welcome to share with the rest of my crew
Now that's on you
I know you fellas who ain't wit' it
You're thinkin' "like, dang Skee, why don't you hit it? do that, yeah!"
But you better think again
Next groupie could be your girlfriend
Just in case it never crossed your mind

[Chorus]

You never what could happen
Everyday situations
It could happen you're going to the store
Somebody drop a house on you and steal yo' slippers
Who knows?
Never crossed your mind[Intro: Deuce]
There once was a kid named Deuce
Who got sick and tired of being picked on
So he got himself a nice 22
Click boom, now he's on the fuckin news

[Verse 1: Deuce]
Now who's the king of these rap acts? American Bad ass
They say he's a class act, no wonder he's jabbed at
That's why they put me up in lights and I rap back
And have these critics wanna mimic my crack ass
He ain't no cinic but he knows where your dad's at
They ain't gonna finish til' they send you to Bagdhad
And minute by minute they goin' pull you right in it
You go' end up at clinics because they put you on xanax
But don't you worry I'm back ya Deuce is back with a black hat
Cape and a black cat baby I'm the new Batman
You know only sarah can grab that
I don't need no groupies trying to grab at my pants
Hoping that I'm gonna go back and tax that
I ain't endin' up in no place with no bad rash
How come I get laughed at by media trash bags
Just because I'm white and I sing like I'm half black

[Hook]
Now you see my life and it looks so pretty, looks so pretty
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride we both know that's silly, know that's silly
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad

Skee-Lo

[Verse 2: Skee-Lo]
I'm gonna make it no matter how long it takes me
I'm sick of low end living, I can't allow it to break me
My neighbors hate me, all they do is just make me
Bounce back, get on my hustle, achieving great things
An architect building my future, watching it grow
Reaching out to the youth and I'm teaching them what I know
I done see a lot of people do anything for the dough
Even rob, steal, kill, good girl that turned pro
Good fellas turn stick up kids I used to know
Little Bobby graduated in college, he couldn't go
The Earth rotates, [?] thirty-seven and the third
Cops pull us over tonight, I'm on the curb
Getting handcuffed, deputy searching for contraband
I'm face down talking to God, he understands
Tomorrow I'ma start a new life, a changed man
But tonight I going to jail for eight grams and

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Deuce]
I was born to rip shit, Born with too much wit
That's why they call me the wizkid cause I drop hits
Mimic me? I'm too sick, you can't hang I'm too quick
What's my name? DEUCE BITCh, it's the new shit
Leavin' ego's bruised in ya you're trapped you're stupid
Try and step in my shoes but it's foolish
I'm coo coo homie I got screw's loose
Fuck Tool you can kiss my ass too bitch. You and your affiliates
You're worth two cents of my time and a few bars so move bitch
As long as I'm doing music, I'ma be a nuesence, It's a new movement

[Hook] (x2)[Hook]
My name is Skee and I’m raw
Niggas can’t believe that I’m raw
This little nigga go Mighty Mouse when I Hercules your jaw
When I take a leak in your spa
When I take the keys to your car
I’m central, South Central, F-U side of the law
Nigga this raw

[Verse 1]
I told you before that I really ain't nothing to fool with
You niggas that come in the game and mention my name I want nothing to do with
You’re useless, like monkey wrenches from one of my tool kits
A nigga that’s not a solution is part of the problem if he really don’t do shit
This is the new shit, out of the blue shit, we calling it hip hop
Serving you niggas like IHOP, hurting you bitches and why not (2Pac!)
Black guy with a black eye, fat lip want to set trip
My nine-millimeter bust sixteen rounds in the air motherfucker on exit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Anybody that’ll open his mouth and fuck around with a veteran
I done told you, illiterate son of a bitch
I’m in a room full of medicine (Excedrin)
Exhilarate nothing but hate and give a motherfucker Ativan
Excuse me, but I go to pray east so nigga don’t go H.A.M
A nigga got bars, a nigga got cars, a nigga got flow, a nigga got style
You niggas got ours, niggas from Mars
Black guy with a black eye fat lip want to set trip
My nine-millimeter bust sixteen rounds in the air motherfucker on exit

[Hook]

[Instrumental Outro]
Raw!
Raw!
Raw!
Raw!
Raw!
Raw![ Joe Love ]
Last year when I went home, got in my car and got gone
Hit the streets and shot on, 18 years since I'm gone
Call my homie Jerome, spoke to his brother Tyrome
Who seemed a little distant cause my calls were not persistant
He say Rome went to prison for resistin' arrest
And mamma had a problem wit her chest, what, cardiac arrest
I was hurt and ain't even been here a week
And after all that bad news I couldn't speak
And my toes went weak and my legs went numb
It gets crazy in the streets tryin' to live wit no funds
Don't cheat you don't eat, your case you can't beat
Public defenders is there to make the deals go sweet
For the prosecution it's like an execution
But you can mae it if you're patient and avoid confusion
It took a while for me to learn this and stay on my feet
But if this rappin' don't happen for me I'm goin' back to the streets

[ Chorus (2x) ]
Street life, street life, street life, street life
Street life, street life, street life, street life

[ Skee-Lo ]
Before the day that I blew up back when I grew up
Back when I had a shag chewin' gum wearin' chucks
Before I even thought about makin' the big bucks
I was busy throwin' rocks at cars and dump trucks
Even now I can hear her mamma callin' my full name
Me and uncle Joe would be watchin' the Bulls game
Before they had Jordan when all you needed was change
To get yourself some candy, some pickles and sugar canes
Even then I could feel the streets movin' all through
My veins and everything I seen absorbed in my brain
I'm not afraid to tell it my brother I'm not ashamed
You take a look at me now and look at where I came
Robert Taylor, 4500 on State Street in Chicago
Where most of the hoodsters and thugs be
If it hadn't of been for all the people that loved me
And for god's grace life get cruel and ugle in the streets

[ Chorus (2x) ]
Street life, street life, street life, street life
Street life, street life, street life, street life

[ Skee-Lo ]
It's all good
But people don't, got it misunderstood, street code is
Simply you stick to your own hood
Stay in your own woods and chop your own tree
And if something jumps off pretend you didn't see
Keep your mouth shut up, for you get knocked up
Ain't no since in tryin' to get somebody else locked up
And that's the truth
That's why I send messages to the youth
Hope the lord makes a way out
Forget the gang and stay out
Cause everybody wants to live in the sunshine
If not right now at least at one time
Look back in your mind remember you was a kid
Remember before you grew up how innocent you lived
From big wheels to big thrills and big heights
From innocent to killin' your brother for Air Nikes
And I can't believe that none of these things don't
Strike y'all brothers in the head like this ain't right

[ Chorus (2x) ]
Street life, street life, street life, street life
Street life, street life, street life, street lifeAh, how many brothers been charged?
Go through wires and set fires in my garage
Sabotage, I'm coming to you fools in camafloughe
Gods must be crazy, stole yo' style from the eighties
Lookin' at that show lady, why she look like Brady?
Shady business, wanna stop and look at my profile
People like me be catching girls with Kangol hats on Argyl
Styles, skills, I get ill everytime I rhyme
Quantum leaps stole my jeep, gonna catch that fool in time
Cause I'm Skeeter, Mr. Nine Milimeeter, with bad aim
Fame, Now I'm gonna live forever, never say die
Bronze eyed and black guy with a black eye, fat lip, wanna set trip
Dang y'all, look at my watch, I gotta shake this spot
So pow, look at this brother with stilts
Thinkin' his name was Skeeter, Mr. Nine Millimeeter
What the? holy cow
A brother hung a couple of sings from these trees
The day that I became an MC

[Chorus]

I'm your idol like Micheal, so won't you beat it
I'm deader like Shredder, I joined the Foot now I can't be defeated
Mis-treated MC's like it was the eighties
My style is tigher than a wet lycra on a two hundred and fifty pound lady
Maybe, maybe not
Maybe you should check that
Pop this in yo' tape deck, play me in yo' cassette
On Channel 7 News At 11 watch these fools get hurt
Have you more confused than a Christian reading a bible in a Muslim church
Come down to earth, now ask yourself is worth
Losing your title in a rap recitle?
I've been vital since my birth
MC's get vaided cause I'm over-rated
And if you laughed it, you ran
But when I blast it, you lucky you made it
I'm the most hated MC, just like the OB
You'll be outy like last year, cookin' like Gary Coleman
Cause no man, no children or woman can get with the Super
I got the West Coast sewn up and I load up your spot trooper
And ain't no to be continuied
When I get in you get looser
Hope that you get used to losing
So shut up and start thinking
Before I leave you danglin' from my mic cords
And you hear me swingin'

[Chorus]

Put yo' gun away, Superman don't run away
See I got x-ray, I can spot you like OJ on the freeway
But anyway, we can do this all today
Cause I embarass more people on national telivision than Richard Baye
Today's topic: "MC's who set-up for beat downs"
Sit down and tell me about your last lyrical melt-down
You come to battle you get beat like drums
And I'm a put you on the bus and send you back to where you came from
And I don't care if you don't like me now
You go home and tell your friends I'm the mighty one
AKA Skeeter, Mr. Nine Milimeeter, with bad aim
Also known as Skee-Lo, but you can call me Supreman

Super, Superman
You know they call me Superman

[Chorus](Skee-Lo)
Yeah, this is not the diddy cause the diddy's dum, dum
Now I'm checkin out the sounds of the phat jazz drum
The horns and the samples with the bass and the boom
When added all together it's a phat jazz tune
Listen examine this carefully you can even dance to the beat
Or chill and have a seat or choke of the smoke of a cactus tree
As I'm steady pumpin sounds out my NBC
With the natural ability to make you wanna get down
And maybe slap five to everyone around
So pass me a drink stop and let me think
About the sounds of the street - The Funkadella Beat
So go and get your friends and strap yourselves in
For the journey's of your life the saga now begins
3, 2, 1 contact we have lift off right?
So I'm about to take flight and this is how it sounds

(Skee-Lo)
I freak the funk on the microphone check it baby 1, 2
Cause I got the skills and I thought that maybe you knew
That I can be chilled and have a good time
So when you see me - make sure you throw up your peace signs
Recline, let your mind be free
Till the break of dawn at a club I'll be
So you know to put your dirty hands up in the air
And wave em side to side like you just don't care, yeah
Sister's in the back with the afro's
And the brothers in the corner with the jerboas
And if you haters start trouble you know where to go
And now you're tuned in to the sounds of the Skee-Lo
I take the stage and your aid to another fella emcee
Produce tracks is not whack with sounds from my MP
3, 2, 1 contact we have lift off right?
And so I'm about to take flight and this is how it sounds

(Skee-Lo)
Beats they be infinite and phatter than the pork
The sounds can be heard from Cali to New York
Forget about your troubles forget about your blues
Cause jazz is alive so go and spread the news
And once the news is heard then others can relate
Maybe find the phattest samples from the back of the crates
So chill cool with the breeze microphone check one, two to the three
Break down doors dance on floors and have your fun
Cause the party doesn't stop till the morning comes
Yeah, now I can feel the beats so I'ma kick back for a second
Have a seat yo and this is how it sounds

(Skee-Lo)
This is how it sounds
Yeah, this is how it sounds[Intro]
Yeah, Skee-Lo, tights
When the vibe is right

[Hook]
You see, I found a love and it feels strange
And I don’t know your name and all I wanna know is
Can you be my love?
And I know you feel the way and trust me, I feel the same
That's when the vibe is right (Yeah, yeah, that's when the vibe is right)
Vibe is right

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, I can feel your vibe
Makes me want to thrive
So amazing how you make a brother feel alive
I don’t really have a girl, I was telling lies
Hanging with the guys I was only talking jive
I apologize, you the only one I need
I just want to make you happy but I can’t cope
Kind of difficult to be, kind of difficult to see who we are
So I hope to start a conversation, she’s Haitian
I’m from the nation, we can take a vacation in fact
Meet up at the local train station in fact
Wait here 'till a brother get back
Or you can call me, baby, this is all me, you can even stall me if you got to
Sleeping with a bunch of niggas if you want to
But don’t you, cause you’re much too smart for that
I can feel your vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, when the vibe is right
I’m the liveliest, right?
Hit the boulevard and we can go dancing
Come here, baby, let me show you what I’m feeling
You the only woman that I see in the building
You know you make a brother want to hit the ceiling
You want to have children? I’m willing to get married
Go to Can Cujn, picture you & me we at our honeymoon, Bell-Cap
Room service, she’s nervous
Come here, baby, let me show you what a birth is
I know I’m moving at a thousand thirty-seven and a third like the earth is
You can just call me, baby this is all me, you can even stall me if you got to
Mess around and stay single if you want to
But don’t you, cause you’re much too smart for that
I can feel your vibe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, even through the hard times
If I’m doing hard time or I’m working part time for a year or so
I get back on the grind, cause you stay on my mind
Even through the hard times I ain’t hearing no rumors
You and him, me and her, never did occur, I just want to be with you
Never really felt something as real as this
I just really want to see it through
I’m at 4522 Colfax, block from the Wal-Mart by the train tracks
Right where the hoods and the thugs hang at
But you can come through and relax
Baby jump to it, I’m going to do it
Find me a hell of a woman, that’s what you is
Never met a woman strong as you, I’m gone with you
I can get along with you, I’m feeling your vibe

[Hook](*Come on scratched several times*)

(Skee-Lo)
Jump, jump geronimo
Buckle up and here we go
I'm here to entertain and introduce my name
I'm Skee to the Lo and I'm here to do a show
And if you forgot or do not then act like you know
If you could see this wannabe I'm makin sure you're readin me
Know of me knew of me let me hear your demo
I rushed it rushed it to the toilet and I flushed it
Cause cuss words are hush words so sshh I'm disgusted
Just sit back baby listen to your radio
Baffled as a bat sayin who is that?
It's the mad, mad ones from Mad Tracks
Makin mad beats for you punks to get mad at
So, if you really want to know to who's beat am I rhymin
Really doesn't matter cause I'ma make ya scatter

(Chorus)
(*Come on scratched several times*)
Not unless I say I'll be waitin
Not unless I say I'll be waitin

(Skee-Lo)
Snap, crackle, pop
Oh wow look at me now
Holy cow watch me blew up blow up
Make ya throw up
I got mad fills to make mad bills
If I want a buffalo ruffa-so big
About my chis-nip skills I get ill to make a mill
From the basement of my cris-nip
Wreck shop and get biz with ruff kids
Like Jodeci makin sure you notice me
Or was we emcees but wanted all our enemies to stop
And just run, run from-a cause I'm the done, done-a
I'm rappin you don't want to hear that so
The number 1 I'm 2, I'm 3, yo follow me
Yo nuff respect due to the one who calls me

Relieve is from the Endo leave
You got beef and loose teeth
But you really wanna start we can take it to the park

(Chorus)
(*Come on scratched several times*)
Wait, waitin in the park

You know I'll cross the sea as if my name was Noah
Watch out cause I know ya
Clear across the continent
Cause you know Apacalla like the lickin monument
(So heeey!) I'm famous but never call me nameless
I don't like cookies, never been a rookie
Played hooky so whoopee
Arrest me protest me do what you wanna
But you no your gonna have to give me props, give me props
I zip like lock grab my microphone and rock bad news on the block
Did you forget forgot sweat me not
Well listen to the sounds of a rapper go pop
The weasel like diesel I fills up your truck
?I lock ya to the talent? so that I make the bucks

Give me a beat so I can flow and I'm gonna wreck that too
Cause I'll be waitin for ya

(Chorus)
(*Come on scratched several times*)
Wait, waitin in the park
