[Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dog[Spoken Dialogue]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed...

[Intro: RZA]
See, sometimes
You gotta flash em back
See niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source
Do the knowledge... yo!

[Hook: RZA, GZA]
When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete Rock-ed it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut...

[Verse 1: GZA]
Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my clan in the front want it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GZA]
I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
But the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

[Hook][Intro: LP version only]
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death

[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]
The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cos I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse Three: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions

[Verse Four: The Genius/GZA]
The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused[Intro: Method Man/Johnny Blaze]
Special technique, fuck that
Special technique of shadowboxing, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn, pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Method, Goddamn, I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Maximillion, Maximillion
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the hip-hop
Johnny Blaze, Maximillion
Maximillion

[Verse 1: Method Man/Johnny Blaze]
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking Scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh, in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You shoulda learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist hip-hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don't like it dick up in you fuck ya

[Hook]
Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

[Verse 2: GZA]
I slayed MC's back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar, trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching, and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA, to charge niggas twenty G's a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryin to size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack, and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now

[Hook]
Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing[Intro]
Ohh mad one
We see your trap
You can never escape, your fate
Submit with honor to a duel, with my son
I agree

I see you're using an old style, I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

[Verse 1: GZA]
Yo, Picture bloodbaths and elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow moving MC's is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors, and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions facial expression
Leaves impressions, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts Son here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th in Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grown on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

[Verse 2: Master Killa]
This is not a eighty-five affair, made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer bees are stinging while I reveal
Science, that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks, with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum, shocked in the hip-hop livestock
Seeking for a serum, to cure em

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, K's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!

At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanishedAllow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing

[Intro]
Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggas for coming in my fucking face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous

[Verse 1 : Inspectah Deck]
Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leaving mics with a cast
Causing ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes running wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I sliced the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I
Rebel INS Your Highness Blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U and bust through like a fullback

[Verse 2 : Ghostface Killah]
Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tapping inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife like Bobby Digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins, Wu wins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gasping, swallowing aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Blow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens and ear like Shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns, throwing cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxing
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats
Taxing kingpin of the rap drug trafficking
Fearless niggas get slapped in Manhattan
For rapping, Big Ghost steps off laughing
Ha!

[Interlude : samples]
Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me

[Verse 3 : Raekwon]
Sit back relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and Tecs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keeping up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off
Putting fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matter of fact just adapt
Tie up, your black Nike's and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners
What up, dread? Feds caught your bredren for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify laying in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Clingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infra-red guard your beam, so seek nuff respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it moving mash'allah
Pro black like tar
Designing the fly shit and stay shining
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pulling out Macs for fun

[Verse 4: GZA/Genius]
The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguing MCs, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
To split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid and nobody knows
How we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producing data, microchips of software
Underground and off air
The Land of the Lost, notorious henchman from the North
Striking niggas where the Mason-Dixon line cross[Intro]
I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in

[Hook: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

[Hook: Life]
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (x2)

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

[Hook]I took her off the showroom floor no money down
Near the Chrysler building in the heart of Midtown
200 horse-power under the hood
Junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods
Designer frames with windshields that stay tinted
The most beautiful thing someone invented
Her wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
A sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
Rear view mirror that of Serena William
Staring was a crime then the look, kill 'em
Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax
Cash in the glove compartment free from tax
Low mileage on the odometer
Graduate with more degrees than a thermometer
Spark plugs for great conversation
She would focus on the finish line and destination
Steering in the right direction
Made sure I wore seat belts had air bags for protection
In her tank she loved to stash my tool
I kept her full, super-unleaded fuel
She had a room full of skirts and rims
The old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs
A temp at the Ford modeling agency
Suburban area where the Caucasians be
Her great-grandfather was a Cherokee Indian
Explorer and navigator traveling then begin
Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock
Commander-in-chief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock
King of the frontier, rider of thoroughbreds
He was just as sharp as a needle without thread
Legend in truth but known to run the herd
His sons were oldsmobiles who drank thunderbird
Land cruisers sitting on fertile soil
With equipment that ran off expensive oil
Folks bragging said the horse pulled a Volkswagen
They love mustang sally and lollygagging
Fished in Lake Tahoe cooked the barracudas
Hunted impalas with the six-shooters
From a long range with the dog Rover
It was something else to see 'em knock them over

[Verse 2]
Some got caught in the crossfire
Bunch of rabbits indicating these dudes should retire
One was going bald rocking a sunroof
A gas guzzler in his grill was one tooth
A strong accent, and a beard like Lincoln
Who hated the golf course, but he loved drinking
Avenger, used to pick up chicks
Had magnums that were ram tough but thick
He wore blazers where he used to hide the Ruger
For encounters with the jaguars and cougars
A veteran who could salute and sing the anthem
In accord with the plan he was the phantom
He had a fat lady they called hummer
And umm, she needed body work the whole summer
She had a few friends who used to stay in a pound
Abandoned the parking lots, and junk yard bound
Regulars in rest areas and truck stops
Cassette players, known to make the tape pop
Gold diggers who on the cream like Wells Fargo
In Vegas, they circle around the Monte Carlo
You know the snakes with the fangs and vipers
Bloodsuckers who will juice then piss from diapers
Met the Cavaliers at the Outback steakhouse
Chicken cutlets (cutlass) supreme just for takeout
One of them was forced to live in Astoria
Cause at the auction, they had crowned victoria
Since then her friends charged her battery
Had her running off with the sweets of flattery
She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her
Police used to always pull over this duster
A pothead who some called a firebird
A foul mouth, who could have used wiser words
Her man used to hustle and ran a crack corner
So insecure he kept LOJACK on her
Creeping with his visors low, high-beaming
Temper would accelerate, private eye scheming
He would check her consoles for rubbers
She would pass the inspection with flying colors
She would turn left if he said right
On her cycle, he would often run red lights
His voiced echoed as she dodged the convo

-----"PROTOOLS"-----

Her previous owner, all he did was bone her
Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner
He had her leaking transmission fluids
Said it was an accident, didn't mean to do it
No insurance with her grill decayed
She sobbed uncontrollably, still stayed
Another total eclipse of the heart
Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
Plus he had a sidekick in his garage
And if he needed a boost, she would give him a charge
He was sentenced for running an escort service
Escaped from prison but made a few nervous
His baby mother had wifed a BMW
Number one on the list, so he brought trouble to
She done everything to regain her liberty
Tried to be outty (Audi), but went into delivery
Moved to Aspen, survived a avalanche
A different element, inside a fatter ranch
Far away, when she changed the pattern
The distance was like from Mercury to Saturn[Verse 1: GZA]
Bobby said, "Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip"
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defences are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound

[Interlude: Killah Priest of Sunz Of Man]
You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Who stabbed they husbands sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'mma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor

[Verse 4: Njeri Earth]
I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
'Hark Heralds Angels' and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind[Intro: LP version only]
Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
{*baby gurgling*}
So... come boy, choose life or death

[Verse One: Ghostface Killah]
The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
Cos I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

[Verse Three: RZA]
Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144, 000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions

[Verse Four: The Genius/GZA]
The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
These unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused[GZA]
Speaking of this artform, the slang is dangerous
MC's are like sperm cells, a gang of us
Fighting to reach the egg, biting and lose a leg
Odds are like 1 to 10 million, the kin thread
One from a thousand speaks in his own voice
The other 999, imitates without choice
They never even knowing it, until the going gets rough
You see the Amplified Sample I'm throwing with
I grab the microphone, the unthinkable happens
See the rockets red glare like the guns when clapping
They still cage matching MC's thats scrapping
Not the UFC, but my opponent is tapping
So don't let a little bit of fear turn to hatred
I was sent as a savior to revive what was sacred
Also stop this uncalled for behavior
And sipping back cats, they lactase in flavor

[Hook: GZA]
Got word from the wise to let it drop
Set this on fire, take aim and let it pop
Because regardless to whom or what, even the door shut
I'm giving 'em straight raw, you bringing them all cut
Like Bolivian rock, your watered down hip hop
Raps so out of shape and far from tip top
Pearls next to pebbles, spoons against shovels
Dictators next to rebels, and Gods against devils

[GZA]
No time for backwards thinking, let's think ahead
If you want to sleep when you awake then make your bed
Alotta MC's came to see me on referals
Not even knowing that they would undergo great perils
These cutting edge methods from the most specialized
Faster than the last men, and before the dust'll fly
The lord of the art, strikes a chord in your heart
Your ear love to hear the God, ripping tracks apart
Me to hip hop, is like Einstein to science
A match made in heaven, most likely an alliance
Complex individual that you dream of being
Intellectual challenging, the all eye seeing
Got an appetite for heat, so then come and bite the beat
And digest the rest and don't stress the part you couldn't eat

[Hook][Verse 1: Dante]
Ecology is life
Life that surrounds us
Everyday living with the things that we bundle up
A single cell organism is the things that we coming from
Coming from the brain cus im insane in the membrane
Shout out to the lyrical miracle together
We are two lyrical individuals
All miracles start from something
The center of it is the nucleus
Cells divide and soon life is surrounding us

[Verse 2: Athen]
A girl wants to have a baby
Call that ovulation
Gotta concentrate on the first verse like the first step
Like fertilization
This sort of flow
Is a boat that'll never sees too float
Bringing old school rap with science
Like parental chromosomes
Watch every eye on me together like a morula
About 64 if you want a number now thats a show
Even though im blastocyst
Just a little hollow my fans follow
My fans follow Athen the great voice of tomorrow
Check my check my check my check my
Check my check my flow 1234
Like the cells in the embryos
Kicking down your door
I connect with my fans
Like a placenta
I nourishing with the knowledge
And excreting all the extra
And so I spit the extra
About ecology and biology
Shout out to Miss B
Cause she helped me see life logically
So you know I got to finish
You the turtle in this rabbit race I'm winning
And I will forever be spitting
And rocking the shows for centuries and more
In this rap game, I'm trying to hit the high score
But for now I'm delivering just like an umbilical cord

[Verse 3: Delgado]
Oh god, where do i start, with human body parts
The first to do it Adam and Eve, or what you believe
The topic of discussion, talking 'bout these bodily functions
They got me rapping about sexual reproduction
Bars like a Twix split in 2 like a daughter cell
Kit-Kat got 4 the second telophase okay let's even the score
But back it up to the beginning of time
Well lets just say we beat our homies to the finish line
And if we didn't, best believe me then we would dead
It's like a million man march for a boiled egg
But the product is a living organism, with a heart and brain
Genetics from my pops, that's how this young spitter got his name
This girl said we gon' lose, but I don't believe in abortion
But I heard she got flow so I gotta take precaution
I got various flows like a chromosome
Macaulay Culkin in this game I guess I'm home alone
Delly{*kids chanting in foreign tongue*}

[Intro: RZA]
(Attention!) Yeah, yeah..a special guest appearance
From the slums.... (Attention!) yo, aiyo

[RZA]
I examine your diameter, third eye light the camera up
Be careful, I got four ninjas, inside your parameter
Perimeter, flame burst out all sides like Gamera
My poisonous is released, gas from the canister
Raise the black fist, we keep the earth on it's axis
I make a good day move slow like molasses
Welcome to the bee hive, dual processor with the G5
There's not a tape or disco break I can't revive
In this high tech world of fire wire and microchip
We still keep the four-five clip, filled with the spiral tip

[GZA]
I come from the 36 Chambers of danger
With many lyrical swordsmen, that quick to change ya
The difficulty to see closely, is mostly
It's a critical point, when ya rap niggas approach me
Like the blind, death, dumb, who mind was left numb
A non B-Boy nigga, couldn't rhyme to the drum
When I started M.C.'ing I entered, the gates of pleasure
Not knowing, I be coming with, too much to measure
With the math of an elder, and the steel of a welder
The path of tray, that I had laid down, and held a
Blueprint, that would draw attention like the Pope
I examine all with the internal mirror of the scope

{*Sen Dog speaking in Spanish*}

[RZA]
Supreme deluxe edition, CREAM with a touch of wisdom
Beams that through up the system, spleens, I conduct, you listen
How you gonna tell me no, yo, the fuck you is in
Locked in a four block radius like a public prison
Twenty two year old, dunn, ain't got a cup to piss in
But he got a barrel gun, and that's knuckle twitching
And he got a baby moms and a cousin bitching
Went to catch a body, now he stuck in another prison

[Raekwon]
When you see it, you better acknowledge, your all swords
Blaze the green hundred fours
Pull out on you, blew you for the cause
And Sudan outst a nigga, seclude you from my Clan
This is water Glock, aces on cameras sniffin' raw
Why try to fuck with these lecturers
I'm so high powered, my electrical structure blew down the floor
You was king for a second, I reigned, came with a different name
The W.T.C. Family and more, one!

{*Sen Dog speaking in Spanish again*}

[GZA]
They applause when I make my entrance
I move on 'em with age and experience, before I start the sentence
The rhyme was designed to meet most demand
Is enough to compensate, fertilize the land
He blew out the belt drive, M.C.'s they felt vibes
Powerful dart, narrowly missing your whole tribe
Scientists look, at the magnitude and devastation
But the strands of heavy metal seem to have no relation
But it's always potential for large scale disasters
Because the instrumentals, spins a hundred times faster
Many was taken, is at the price of a pawn
And the collective lost had left, thousand of mourn
Them Clansmen, are the nucleus of hip-hop
There's no room for error, M.C.'s will get dropped
Evidence of terrifying threats from heat pressure
Power by strong winds that blew rhymes off the dresser
The words spread through the town from Yonkers to Leffers
And to kill off the slang was a city wide effort
But they couldn't be more wrong, my click was all strong
Fit together seamlessly, til you're all gone

{*Sen Dog speaking in Spanish again w/ "Attention!" several times*}

[Outro: chess sample]
The queen by far, is the strongest piece
Should too, should not be prematurely brought
Into play, during in the opening
Or she will be attacked by wicked pieces
And driven back, it is very dangerous
To make a raid with the queen early on in the game
It is best, in opening, to make but one move with the queen
And that, to a square where she is not exposed
To any direct or indirect attack[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard / RZA]
"Yo, check this out, my name is the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Youknowhatimsayin, when I rhyme, when I, when I get down for my crown
I come out crazy like a, like a tiger, or something, knowhatimsayin
No, no, nobody can even F' with me, straight up and down
You knowhatimsayin', so that's how we coming in, knowhatimsayin?"
From the heart of Medina, to the head, to the east
To the plaza houses, a/k/a the Mountain
To the rugged lands of Shaolin, yo
We rock all, all, all in together now
Got played, got fresh, up---

[GZA]
The world was bugging off this Wu-Tang nigga on the rock
That was just another spot on the muthafuckin' block
You forgot Cash Rule nigga? Toss seven figures
He pull a trigger to make that account, get bigger
Had babies to feed, kept a bitch with need
Thousands shows booked, promoters on speed
His hands was in everything, including some pussy
From the Brazilian wax, to the uncombed bushy
From down state, psychiatric
Who tried to put a code on his brain until he cracked it
Now the media wanna view him like they knew him
And his head nurse, wanna sue him cause she blew him
Ever since he walked on stage, he was just a loose cannon
Wild drunk staggerin', nigga who kept standin'
Class clown, who erase chalk from the board
The only choir member, that sing off chord, we were

[Hook 2X: GZA (w/ RZA)]
(All, all, all in together now)
Kept the balance, stay dressed for the weather now
Battle M.C.'s, anywhere, whatever town
And remain victorious, in any ground

[GZA]
The All In Together Now, started in Bed-Stuy
Human beatbox specialist, who dressed fly
A half ounce of blow and a forty ounce drinker
Magnificent flow, critical thinker
Unique is one grain of sand from the beach
And had bitches eating out of his hand
He was intelligent, his style was relevant
I can name ten niggas that stole an element
From the high speed chase to the court arraignments
All of the above, was entertainment
He caused earthquakes, just from experiments
Some thoughts got lost, not knowing where it went
His songs had a rep for many inducements
Giving birth to new styles, after recruitments
There's no replacement or any supplement
He was a new testament, what he said, what he meant, we were

[Hook 2X]

[GZA]
The judge took a look at he, and threw the book at thee
The sentencing, would have made the average crook happy
They put him in a box, wrapped like a gift
In them straight jacket, watched by two, worked the shift
Gave him no phone calls, saw no sunlight
Like, Billie the Kid, in his last gun fight
Then days became weeks, weeks became months
Carved the calendar on the wall, with his fronts
The food pushed in, on the trays, looking sharp, in the cell
By hands covered with latex gloves
Cooks in the kitchen had laced his drinks
The wild ass physician, they was off the breaks
He got visits from shrinks who came in with ink-blots
Moving with they own plot, but the Dirt, he think not
He had nothing but time on his hands
As if he got a sign from the Clan, we were

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: RZA (chess sample)]
All, all, all, in together now
"All in together now!" - Ol' Dirty Bastard
"All in together now!"
All, all, all, in together now
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"All in together now!"
"Now white doesn't really wanna use up his few remaining pawn moves, so he plays king to e2"[GZA]
All I need is a beat, with a continuous loop
And a live vibe, that'll hypnotize like the flute
Along with something that's rugged by nature like the forest
Composed like the symphony without a chorus
A place with the path and trail that you follow
With the wood, where you drive your nails, but too hollow
Far from reality, with a slim chance of getting back
Even if you narrowly escape the hidden traps
Nothing but the driven raps written in my notebook
Inspired by the cap and the gown, that's on the coat hook
Prepare for the chemical rush, something new to cause
Your heart to bass, but it's tangable to touch
Associate with those who are consumed with beats
Produce fire, until they melt the room with heat
You know my ink lay all over the sheets, let us/letters gather around
And form words, everytime they meet

[Hook: GZA]
Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality
Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D
He or Her, I Islam, then Justice
King of Kingdom, Love, Hell or Right, we still exist
Master, Now in Cypher/O, Power's the Queen
Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same
Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y
Zig Zag Zig, and now we're back home

[GZA]
I brought butter for the popcorn, dip for the chips
And ego for your trip, some scripts for you to flip
Corrections for mishaps, errors, or mistakes
Fly raps for beats, and pop and lock for breaks
A legend in my own lifetime, from one rhyme
That was specially designed, from the hook to bottom line
Shine's like a precious jewel, cut up in the workshop
With specialized handcrafted tools
Couldn't buy this hardware, so don't swipe your card there
Better yet, fold your hand, cuz you holding the wrong pair
One hit wonders, get a little shine like flashlights
But when I drop the bomb and explode like gas pipes
A livewire, known as the dragon that spit fire
Verbal action, hot as the grease from deep fryers
Delivered in the perfect pitch, because hip hop
Is all in my genes/jeans, the pattern is seen in every stitch

[Hook][Verse 1]
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
That vacate your vessel
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
In flight with insight
Everything I thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil, the sun blackened
Then came rap czars, left tracks in scars
Apparent brightness of exploding stars
Gave you goods to taste
No ingredients to trace
You remain stuck trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, release 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate, my rage is great, phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pyroclastic flow, sets forth a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspatial thrust
Even wearing camouflage, you're analog
At war, the scene is high beams and fog
I came in accompanied by deadly rain and wind
Mentally endowed with lightning, struck the crowd
The warm side edge across the barrier
But the storm side destroyed your area

[Repeat verse]

[Outro]
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
That vacate your vessel
The amplified sample, the amplified sample, the amplified sample
Will trample
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
That vacate your vessel
The amplified, the amplified sample
The amplified sample, the amplified
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
The amplified
The amplified sample, will trample, delete and cancel
The amplified, the amplified
The amplified sample (fade out)[GZA]
Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch
The rat squeals
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles
Where the leopards grab the wildebeest down by it's tail
You see the chimps they grow hemps they hustle and sling in trees
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk
Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet
Now you're neck deep in debt with a bunch of loan sharks
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees
The tick moved with the fleas
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough
See a million mosquitos from the West now
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild

[Hook x4 : GZA]
It's like the jungle sometimes

[GZA]
Out of fear of the deer watch for the eye of the tiger
The Clutch from the Cobra and the venomous viper
Boa-constrictors that cut your circulation
Mosts of their prayers die from broke bones and suffocation
The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes
While the black widow

Laid a web for the bachelor
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula
They both prey on grasshoppers beetles and flies
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies
What costs little, is a little worth
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf
From birth they grow up walking the thin line
It's like the jungle sometimes

[Hook x4 : GZA]
It's like the jungle sometimes[GZA]
Associated with metal detectors, loud mouth show-off
To stand out like bite reflected
Words to vibrate like the bass guitar
With the least amount of weight, you should replace a bar
You can tempt me, with looseleaf paper that's empty
I write it in a code, for your average DaVinci
From the era of the REC Room and cassette tapes
Putting empty, rhyme on anything except greats
Too tech mix lay pararrel, the place got marks
On the spot, move around like parasail
The sight sailed obscene, testing ground for new theories
Cuz some DJ's formed the team
Torrential down pour, you hear the sound, more
Nature's fury, and this town is bound for
Hip hop, most violent, most beautiful
Wind gusts, from Justice scenes in the musical

[Bronze Nazareth]
The blade runner, face gunner, mace never cold case
Kept a base stretcher, erase your bass set-up
Freestyles wet up, written, hit your kitchen ketchup
Mass grown, hand feets'll shout, whatever the weather
Body white, sheet stretcher, mic aim leary's atcha
Rapture rhyme graphter, smash the camera
Arm & Hammer hand jammers, slam-a-grammer, Ghost standard
Everything you touch turn Bronze, I'm like the old stanza
Handle vine cables, swing 'em like Tarzan
Divine rhyme plant pay you, digits to farlands
Peace to my cousin, who smoking clouds, open house
Prepare once a month in the Source, like the menstrual's out
Guns accumulate, devout, get my pension with the pencil out
Thoughts stench on my potential droughts
Resume the rain, no matter the windchill
I make you think, still Detroit/Killah Hill
Deeply my footprints build for bodies to feel
Raised by the dumpsters, black, the Zombie-ville
Gun Rule burglars, with murderers masks
Known to filter out the snakes that be burning the grass

[Kevlaar 7]
Associated with black steel, in the hour of chaos
Unreal, like niggas in the seance
Some say I, and grab you with the pen
If you murder the king, I live forever in the end
I've been evil, through the eye of a needle
Just when I grab the steel, as black as Don Cheadle
Feeble and weak, I peep Samson niggas
Revolution come, I pull hair and then triggers
Invented the cause, when pause was indented
Face the follow leads, the flame, my mind painted
John Lennon gats, clapping out of my window
Lay low, one shotty, loo the lasso

[Phillie]
I snap shop, pop out like Polaroids
So wild, we still riot like the middle of Detroit
The SWAT, South West A-Team, the block
Do say, when grace hip hop, the Beijing around-the-way cops
Hold me in, like rhyme flicks, phoned in
Still pitched dope, any zip code I'm in
Capture the souls of men, and women alike
Last flow, pin the mic, begin to strike
It ain't no slouchers here, we out this year
Ya'll about that, we about this here
From small cats to the top, in here
Got cares, like we really got a option here
Going all out, GZA on board, now we pedalling
Mainstream, the model still CREAM, that's how we handle shit

[Salute]
Niggas just actors, not really factors
Putting on shows in the street, that bring laughter
What happen to the jabbers, uppercut, scrappers
Confrontation now, bring nothing but gun clappers
Stains on the conrete, blood on the mattress
Mind runs deep like the Nile going backwards
Hip hop dead? Then I'm here to resurrect it
Big Daddy shit, with the "Kane", I'm an expert
"No Half Steppin'", break show amazing
Mad situations, leave the gun blazing
Seeing Vietnam through the eyes of an Asian
Cold hearted lungs, but my tongue spit Cajun[GZA]
I was born, with the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck
It was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin', I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Wore my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven

[Hook: GZA]
And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from...
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood

[GZA]
We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak

[Hook][GZA]
On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bulk
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The Sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave

[Hook: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fates erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

[Killah Priest]
Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, "I'm black and comely"
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail

[Hook]

[Outro: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface[Hook]
Life is a test many quest the universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving earth

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying
I didn't like staying cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia, or the abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
When the bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the ryhme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide
The basic instructions before leaving earth

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I perferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edom
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation - the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

The basic instructions before leaving earth
[Hook][Intro]
Yeah, Perverted Monk representin
YouknowhatI'msayin?

[Afu-Ra]
No need for cappin this
Brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, math this, lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever, brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin Sandstorms, I'll freeze ya, then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These lyrics, I'm wieldin, straight echoes through the building
Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of an eye
Terminate unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars, while they constelate
The heart rate, of my social eloquence, makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know
When you lookin at a real nigga

[Hook]
You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

[GZA]
You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash, from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
Snakes out, hissin, shots missin
Observe, and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin wit loaded dice
It's like gettin stabbed with ice, and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt
Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flow-er, fresh show-er
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin, ride the 808 Roland
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer

[Hook 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves then the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick, and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than a fuckin cactus
Conquerin globes, and universes with Galactus
Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate, but now I'm yellin checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

[Hook 2X][Verse 1: GZA]
Before space and time, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
It was massive energy and it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space of every special place with information encased
Literally, a beginning
This cosmic clock was ticking and allowed space to flow while it was spinning
Everything we see around us
The sun, the moon, the stars, millions of worlds that astound us
The universe inside is hard to fathom
It was composed in a region small as a single atom
Less than one trillionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic but on a macro level within
Unfurling this swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanding beyond comprehension
Within a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size very unstable
In time it would come with a periodic table

[Verse 2: GZA]
You see, space was expanding faster than light speed
It moving at the rate only thought can exceed
A picosecond after the Big Bang
Music of the spheres before the ears, the Universe is now sang
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of a second later 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since the time of birth
Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was mixing within the batter
But mass and energy interchangeable
Convert those particles rearrange-able
Matter and anti-matter, the archrival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there is life and breath there's one remaining left[Hook: GZA]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 1: GZA]
This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the frisbee, Digi [?] Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute
He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot
Therefore your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well-known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger {*echoes*}

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2: GZA]
The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred is the word
You wild cards, jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions show their spades
A large flock of MCs, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: GZA]
Breaker breaker one nine
Breaker breaker one nine[GZA]
Pump and get sumped, you want none
Y'all niggas wanna bring, get done
Flashback, eighty-eight, rag type Volvo
One court solo, slash for logo
Two-hundred hyenas roam the arena
Schemin on a truck Chevy, quit the rush every
Criminal mental, satanic penpal
Wild style on your wax for ten thou'
Most notable, hiphop quotable
See many went, only one got us over do
Floor soakin wet with the drinks and dance sweat
Tell me which click got the deadliest handset
I make the mic pump, force make your feet stomp
Murderous beats move like rope for you to jump
And the two-inch, tighten with the wool-wrench
None qualifyin ass-niggas, the Jon Bentz
Spend it real, 'nuff festivals on the grill
Got a deal, no return with the Brook Shield
Yo

[Chorus 2x: GZA]
Breaker, Breaker 1-9, can't rhyme
Y'all niggas wanna shine, get off blind

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I use and abuse all groups and crews
I can't lose, straight up and down, I'm bad news
Like the bears, we eat folks from under the stairs
Pack a hand trigga, scared niggas don't dare
From the rear, I smash thru like a John Deer
Plant a bomb in ya ear, then disappear
With a speed that'll reach mach five
Niggas pop jive, that's why they on the opposite side
Dick riders tryin to make their way inside
Boy analyze, my camp be amplified
Certified live, right before your third-eye
Supply the mental high for the fiendish
Thru the intervenus, see it like a wide-screen Zenith
Got sweetness, wanna show me your cleavage
Leave it to the specialist, leave your wig split
Leavin no witness, it's a mean business
We mean business, invest in cream
Till my exit scene, I stay plottin on my next scheme

[Masta Killa]
Next scheme
Blessed with the art to pierce and shoot dart
I toke the bass, put your shovel to the Rebel
Allah Just, embrace his face with the metal
Danger, woman adore to the chamber
Let this nigga run out wild with the banger
Hiphop socialize, enterprise, snubs in the club
Twenty wizards, about 300 niggas inching your square
Or could it be the armory?
Fifty-two low hand, touch the ground
Strike his knee, pass the heat to my man
Windmill backhand bust your nose gland
Mic stand, might crash a wild fan
The Aqua, city of Atlantis, mantis, flying locusts
Surround the oppose, a bomb only has one time to explode
I blow and break and quake your whole state
Throw the shit on DAT, and make me a fuckin tape

[Chorus][Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho
Battle cry Samurai, I'm what they call terror
Erasing all errors, give work to pall bearers
I'm talking caskets, coffins, I'm the bastard swordsman
That cause the loss of massive organs
Fear factor, hereafter, disaster
Climb like the stairmaster, coming through, clear a path of
The raw aggression, that'll take your best on
You start talking Teflon, then you switch to Revlon
Nigga, choose your weapon, hope you got your vest on
Talking Superman shit when you ain't got ya S on?
Get ahead of who? Never you, skills too technical
Leave nothing left for you but residue, the state of vegetable
The mad swag and do flaunt it, my dick and you want it
Only question now, is "nigga, who want it?"
Cause once trouble said (like that) trouble dead
Boy don't make me have to pull out this double edge
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo Afro, Virgo, domino
I go Rambo, Gigolo, Romeo
Friday night spend money on a ho-
Tel, to get a good night's sleep, I'm keeping in step
Do I come off? Yep

[GZA]
My sword crash through your breastplate, splash the blood on your scared face
Drops leave your trail in the snow, showing the clear trace
Behind punctured steel, their bodies rot
Arm and leg missing, head laying near the chopping block
An experience, that shattered your spine, break spirits
Same shit that fucks with your mind, you hate to hear it, nigga
Def man world is silent, he hears nothing
But we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing
Floods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts
Many rivers choked with bodies, float it like rafts
Spark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats
Streets filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at
Conflict is imminent, preliminary attack
Everyone's a target, so cemeteries are packed
A solid nigga, drink liquids and gas you up
Hit you with a stupefying drug, pass ya cup

[Hook 2X: Suga Bang Bang]
Why, you trying to test me swordplay, when I'm sharp in every way
This life I live, I'll do it, all by myself[singer]   Chase your dreams...
[R.Report] It's the R-O-B
[E.Tualo]  Rob Report
[R.Report] with GZA
[E.Tualo]  and Esera Tualo
[R.Report] Yeah, yeah, Genius...
[singer]   Dreams... chase your dreams
[R.Report] Diamond Willie, Mega Raw
[E. Tualo] Back to reality
Genius, one time, yo

[GZA]
Yo, in these dark streets, life is never complete
Lords escape from those who strictly Play IV Keeps
Neighborhood; poverty stricten
Spin and Tell like Charles Dickens
The witnesses are sickening
I seen some aquitted with the wildest crime commited
While my brother faced life and never did it
Even in High Tide, they throwing brothers off the boat
In the streets, without a vest, it's hard to stay a-float
She wrote a note, before she *sliced her throat*
Couldn't live without her son, who was killed for his coat
I closely examined, physical branden
Witnessed myself standing in a land struck with famine
Multiple homocides from atomic wars
The aftermath, poison in lakes and reseviors
Thoughts spin, I narrowly escaped Hell's Gate
But only in the physical state

Chorus: singer

I knew a girl who wanted to live The Fast Life
(You're living too fast, baby)
Now the pain cuts like a knife
(You're living trife)
Chasing her dreams instead of reality
She lost her way
And nowhere can save her from the danger
Until she finds her way in Heaven

[Rob Report]
GZA, I got a similar story to tell
'bout the teenage adolescence of this kid named Will
An ex-coroner played the {*censored*}
{*censored*}
Young black and hispanic kids be stressed over
React against the world with rude behavior
In this present year
My search for hunger and ambition is crystal clear
While my young brothers seem to chase dreams
I be gunning down my wildest fantasies

[Esera Tualo]
I be escaping fiends, making cream
Ill kids tried to stick me for the green
Seen things that'll make your head spin
Instead *fuckin* stairways to Heaven make my eyes sparkly like a gem
Where your heart has been? Confiscated by the dark
[R.Report] shorty use a *gun* and spark
Now we's in the street with the heat taking life apart
Seventeen years old, drama unfolds
Missing You like Puffy and Sting, now let them names ring

Chorus {2X}

[Esera Tualo & Rob Report]
Chasing dreams for the cash and cream
It seems some of us are fiends
For them luxery things, supreme sting
Losing lives while we out for the green
Stairs to Heaven shine like they diamond rings

[singer]
Chase your dreams, don't get lost in reality
Cause your dreams will be your savior
And take you all the way to Heaven

Chorus

[Esera Tualo]
Nothing can save you baby
