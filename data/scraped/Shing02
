[Intro: Bill Cosby]
I told you that story to tell you this one

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely

[Hook]
Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, Small tips on the avenue
Never wasted, all hits for a revenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for some time in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in my room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, Oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose my prerogative
There's so much love in me I got to give

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like...I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realizes that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felt a sharper love in the limelight
From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back, that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music helps carry on
Like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

[Hook: x2]
Cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently[Verse 1: Shing02]
Sharp like an edge of a samurai sword
The mental blade cut through flesh and bone
Though my mind's at peace, the world out of order
Missing the inner heat, life gets colder
Oh yes, I have to find my path
No less, walk on earth, water, and fire
The elements compose a magnum opus
My modus is operandi is amalgam
Steel packed tight in microchip
On my arm a sign of all-pro
The ultimate reward is honor, not awards
At odds with the times in wars with no lords

A freelancer
A battle cry of a hawk make a dove fly and a tear dry
Wonder why a lone wolf don't run with a klan
Only trust your instincts and be one with the plan

[Hook]
Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the way of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry

Some days, some nights
Some live, some die
In the way of the samurai
Some fight, some bleed
Sun up to sun down
The sons of a battlecry

[Verse 2]
Look, just the air around him
An aura surrounding the heir apparent
He might be a peasant but shine like grand royalty
He to the people and land, loyalty
We witness above all to hear this
Sea sickness in the ocean of wickedness
Set sail to the sun set no second guessing

Far east style with the spirit of wild west
The "quote-unquote" code stands the test of
Time for the chosen ones to find the best of
Noble minds that ever graced the face of
A hemisphere with no fear, fly over

The blue yonder where
The sky meets the sea
And eye meets no eye
And boy meets world
And became a man to serve the world
To save the day, the night, and the girl too

[Hook][Hook: Shing02 (x2)]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Like a movie that you can't predict
Like a book that you can't resist
I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
Bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
Verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
With the whole city fast asleep, out cold
True words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
Of a poet in me, most powerfully
I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing
Trying to find a reason to work, god willing
I admit, my thinking is wishful
Like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the truth
To fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
On the analog player watch the people glow
Sit back to the breeze let the memories flow
Comedy tragedy all the highs and lows

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Like your moves that I can't predict
Like your look that I can't resist
The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
The lingering appeal was so unusual
Herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
With the whole body fast asleep, out cold
True vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
Of a prophet in me most visibly
I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing
Trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
I admit, our dealing is painful
Like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the picture
Before pixelating the human texture?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
Homecoming gathering with a big surprise
Throw on your favorite record that's good to go
On the analog table and it's hooked to blow
Sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
Hi hat kick drum all the highs and lows

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Um, third time's the charm, hopefully
When I chime on your door you'd still let me in
After all these years
The room that you caved in my heart is exactly the same as you left it
I realize that you have moved on
New styles and cliques like them silent flicks
I'm speechless in this golden occasion
The beautiful expression on the silver creation
This time I'd like to keep in touch
I'm a little bit wiser, a whole lot tougher
If I suffer through another nightmare tonight
We'll chalk it up as another chapter to write, all right?
Or wrong or somewhere down the middle of the road
I wanna see you again in a scene with the backdrop a perfect ten
And the music can take us back to the spot right then
From black and white to a sepia tone
Some dreams come with a tint or in monochrome
From black and white to my skin tone
Some dreams have a stint on the microphone

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Shing02]
Okay we can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
On the analog trail and you look the role
Just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
Sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows

We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite[Verse 1: Shing02]
Once again, now where do I start, dear love
Dumb struck with the pure luck to find you here
Every morn' I awake from a cavernous night
Sometimes still pondering the previous plight
Seems life done changed long time no speak
Nowadays I often forget the day of the week
Taking it by stride if you know what I mean
No harm done, no offense taken by me
So let's rap, we'll catch up to par, what's the haps? Perhaps we're even closer
Now after, all things considered on this side of the planet
Couldn't pick a better time even if we planned it
To come clean and candid if I have to
Oh what I wouldn't trade for your laughter
Sweet and sour spice in my poetry pot melting
Even better than the real thing
It's like the God in me saw the devil in you
I wanted to break myself in the worst way when I met you
Who would have thought, conversate by the river, celebrate birth
Sit and delivered the lines that would prove to be the seeds of trust
Unsigned, yeah but destined to grow with sunshine
Self-assigned task piled on the desk of good works
Knowing hardship appreciate the best of both worlds

Chorus
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E evidently, see every song has a sequel
Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E eloquently, see every dream has a part two
Never same, you got to keep it tight, always just like back then, now hear me out

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Once together, now where do we go, dear divine
I pray that you keep watching over us
From the heavens where light is the nucleus
To this space filled with darkness and negative matter
Anti-gravity pull is what I would rather, feel when I leave this shell eventually
Ties to the mother earth ground me mentally
Real vibes will keep me alive spiritually
Imagination brings bliss at no cost, when I blink blink I receive at no loss
Victory comes in small packages like a leaf of an olive tree brought back by a dove
From above, then I'm gonna rhyme love
Well you saw that one coming ever since the beginning of the end
Well anyways, I am not a perfect being, yes I am, a man full of S-I-N
It's like the devil in me saw the God in you
You epitomize the etymology of enthusiasm
Look it, up there lies the clouds that form the rain
That came from the ocean that flowed from the river
I'm a believer, firm with the first words, lyrical transceiver of our ancient roots
Science plus Arts multiplied by Faith then divided by the number of our ethnic race
Let me mention what I've been thinking
How to save the children, when the ship is sinking
So I'm singing, no lip syncing to slogans
Political hooligans with tanks, missiles and guns
Everything is relative when it's all in the family of man
Understand the time has finally come to realize the great power of one
All formulas equalize under the Sun, amen

[Bridge]
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
All good souls lost may they rest in peace


[Bridge]
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Hip-hop world wide we got to live in peace, like that[Hook]
Snow flakes in January
Heart warm like February
I wouldn't ordinarily
March to the drum, play a fool like April
May the best dance in a Juno bridal
Power of the will, Julius and Augustus
Aw you know, it's just us
In a new semester, back in September
Boy, I wonder if you still remember

[Verse 1: shing02]
Meet me half way from mars to venus
Beep beep, the chase is on between us
Retweet the sweetest piece of confection
Hand made device for remote connection
Ask a question
Wait for an answer and make a suggestion
A time and a place for a first impression
Second and third to a fourth dimension
Rise above the weights that hold us captive
To a square, swear that I, I the captain to
Cruise in sci-fi, red sky burn like sapphire
A moth to a fire, but we can fly higher
Till we reach an apex
We fit tight like a glove with the latex
Bring it down to earth for a cooling session
Laying sideways and glazed in essence
Gazed each other in the eye to find galaxies of
Uncharted nebulas
Heard joy over spilled milk on a quilt, of lavender
Woven in the fabric of our calendar
Dress up at the end of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: shing02]
When you took my hand, I couldn't hide it
Way too delighted
Tried to ride it cool but obliged to write it
Wouldn't fight it, how my watch paused
When I put my lips on your eyelids
The lost second, deposit in a memory bank
Every chance I pocketed a cent
A blank check with ya signature
Font sans serif, the curvature, a lone harbinger
With toys play coy like fish in a pond
Fond words serve poems like dish
Life is short like a doggone leash
Or a fuse in an open circuitry
That got struck by lightning
Hang a painting on the wall over the writing
Brighten up the room for a private dining
Increase the peace and cease the anxiety
Spread love and cc: the whole society
You got me shooting off on a tangent
Like I always do when I'm on the fringe
And the tally of the letters will reach
The valley where the wings will seek
A series so classic at the top of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Hook]Till death do us apart, and it did
Come sudden like clouds, and it hid my sun
My truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let them whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

In your last breath you told me, that you had to go
Cause it pained you so
Oh I loved you so much so
Was I selfish to hold on
And cling on to your body that hosts a soul
That wanted to set free the eagle in a cage
And you became eagerly what I wanted to be
You the person to leave, I the person
To see off another best friend to land's end
I watched grown men moan, and women weep
As you quietly descended six feet deep
But the spirit ascended before our wet eyes
A gift from god, returned to sender
Though I like to pretend that this never happened
I can turn around and see you laughing
But the fact is you could never practice
Getting blind-sided and eating the wind shield
Endless field of shards of glass
This too shall pass, but reality bites, it says not so fast
First you must climb a calvary of shattered hopes
And then a mountain of prayers unheard
'till you reach that peak where you can see the dark abyss below
Then you let me know if you have what it takes for a leap of faith
I had to say, hell no, heaven yes, but not yet
Please bless a forehead, cold in a bed
Or alone on the road with nobody to hold
When the pouring rain is too much to bear
It's a reason to live for a seed that needs care

Till death do us apart and it did
Come sudden like clouds and it hid my sun
My truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let it whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Now I hit this stage in honor of you
How's the other side, I bet it's a splendid view
No more stress for rent, or to make ends
Collide in a cocktail, shame with envy
I can hide behind lens that block the UV
Looking in from the outside the bowl is murky
The toll for the bridge is rising
Weatherman says storm, city hall is burning
Same ol' chaos, gotta shut my cell like I'm waiting to take off
On the runway, scoping out the window
The moisture covers the sight though
Telling myself it's just another day in the life of a starving artist
Trying to paint a dream you woke from
Chasing the departed
We used to hang by the banks to see who can skip a stone the farthest
What I thought was a stream is now an ocean
No such thing as an extreme to show devotion
To your craft, which I didn't know the half
Tried to knock down your door and caught the backdraft
And a whiplash, all in reverse
Then I finally stood up and said, we reserve the right to serve anyone
And on the same note you deserve the best of the most fun
By the way I got your letter, you said you were fed up
Well I second that and I reckon that you tried
So I don't place a blame that you took the fifth
And the first flight out of town, into the mist

Till death do us apart and it did
Come sudden like clouds and it hid my sun
Your truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let 'em whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Whether a tree lives to see the end of centuries
Or a random hand picks it instantly
Life is art, a miracle for all to see
I must tell you that you lived beautifullyI met a metaphorical girl in a metaphysical world
Now you got me day dreaming, sleeping in a curl
Her name on my tongue, a fresh flavor, yup
Whenever she popped up, put a swirl on my cone
I used to rap like I had some marbles in my mouth
But the stones turned precious when they all came out
On a string of deep thought that could never be bought
Body rock don't stop, be bop to hip hop
Cold as ice so I stared as it thawed to the floor
What was left a shoestring budget on call
Then these new styles came along
Some on to the next on some other hit, their own trip
Colors faded on airbrushed centerfolds, dated
Make you feel old and jaded
The goal was to make it and we made it but
We didn't know how to keep it
Like nice kicks. that wouldn't fit
Only way was to box it up and duct tape it up
Store it underneath the bed and open it up
Once in a blue moon
Think about a cool ending
To a story that ended too soon
Gotta bring back the feeling
I'll do anything not to be stuck on fiending
A pen can be sharper than a scalpel to a patient
To an open heart, it's a daily operation

After six come seven and eight
Access code to the pearly gates
They say heaven can wait
And you speak of fate
A finale to a play for my mate
I see the angels draw the drapes
Over the earthscape
Where the wine is the spirit of grapes
Gotta finish what we started, so I cut the tape
As our records will stay on rotate

You say a circle is a flawless shape
Every part equi-distance from the center
On the arc without a start or a finish
A line on a loop carries weight
A freight train runs unabated
Views vanish from my point vantage
Passages come in and out
The way I recall your antics (how I remember your antics)
Still alive cause I said it
A life of its own unless we dead it
Till they see our name in credits
A labor of love you mean slavery
Surely, it's been quite savory
Crepe on the balcony, verbal alchemy
Pure magic when she touches me
I read that love is kind but it's also blind of any style
You profess, would you be my guest (you could be my guest)
Happiness is a hot potato that you can't possess for long
Just pass it on like a song
And I might look calm and collected at a glance
But I taste the void when I'm not connected
To the world kinetic, as opposed to static
Idle hands a workshop of a digital addict (a modern-day addict)
On a hot streak for inspiration is key to feed
The mind in need of stimulation
Elevator music to the space station
Penthouse of stars a-blazing

After six come seven and eight
Access code to the pearly gates
They say heaven can wait
And you speak of fate
A finale to a play for my mate
I see the angels draw the drapes
Over the earthscape
Where the wine is the spirit of grapes
Gotta finish what we started, so I cut this tape
As our records will stay on rotateI was a young tyke age fourteen
the shy type, chit chat an ordeal
the first phrase I heard you say was awesome dude
fly with the fat lace hightop shoes
you were tight with the clique you grew up with
I didn't have the guts to get close to but
when I heard the music you bumped in the lot
I didn't understand the foul language
found out later you were raised by an uptight mom
still whenever you said muthafucka' it hurt
little did I know it came from a grand grand grandmuthafucka
must've had it engrained huh
songs from the church to the rhymes on the streets
now "all growed up" and sho' enuff
binge drinking, big spending class president
runnin wild with the credit
tab you let it pile like bills
stress, pop some pills
hopping on 'em, cheap thrills
go spend your way out of debt
cheat your way out of death
you're way out of line, Ameri
speed too wreckless
I speak out of love
how I pray you wake up, Ameri
though I know that
you were never mean to me
how much you mean to me, Ameri

the next time I saw her she was pushing a carriage
went into the market and hid some cabbage
into the stroller along with some carrots
both of her earlobes laced with carats
she seem to walk gingerly
I leisurely went around the aisle,
snuck around while she walked right past me
talkin' about fancy things to her earpiece
I had the chance, see
took a quick glance, her baby was plastic
cheeks made of rubber and smile was elastic
oh wow that image everlasting
how could you go from adorable to nasty
in such a short span man
you once had a vibe of an angel the mind of a pan's labyrinth
I had a dream discovering the secret chamber
the most sacred amber
window to your soul I gazed in amazement,
in a photograph, your style was never same and
that was then well this is the hereafter
what did you capture, Ameri?
you know when you went away to the big city
you said "see you on the cover", Ameri
they call your uncle a bandit
the rap I can't stand it
wherever did you go, Ameri

I gotta be honest, I had my funnest
moments with you Ameri
I wrote letters and poems to girls I met
on the road when I did my year abroad
I told them stories I knew and they had you in them
now they wanna visit Ameri
cuz nothing compares like having familay
in a foreign country,
had to leave only to realize just how much I missed you
and all I brought back was a fistful
of white sand in a bag
small taste of blissful memories
I didn't want things to end
like a good meal, a good beat, or a movie
don't even trip off the time it's soothing
forget about the past just grooving
all day and all night ooh wee
and that's how we gotta be, Ameri
nah I'm not afraid to say you and me
and that's how we gotta be, Ameri
we could take on the world, don't you see

I just wanna call your name Ameri
I just wanna say I got you Ameri
I just wanna tell you this Ameri
that I'll send a kiss good luck Ameri[Verse 1: Shing02]
Sharp like an edge of a samurai sword
The mental blade cut through flesh and bone
Though my mind's at peace, the world out of order
Missing the inner heat, life gets colder
Oh yes, I have to find my path
No less, walk on earth, water, and fire
The elements compose a magnum opus
My modus is operandi is amalgam
Steel packed tight in microchip
On my arm a sign of all-pro
The ultimate reward is honor, not awards
At odds with the times in wars with no lords

[Hook]Black Is Beautiful

Black is beautiful to me
Wake up brethren Asian persuasion
Black is beautiful to me
Love Self sistren Asian persuasion
Black is beautiful to me
Respect brethren African persuasion
Black is beautiful to me
One Love sistren African persuasion

Afro-centric music is the roots but
Ever since birth I've wondered
Who, what, when, which, how did we get to this place
Island culture cultivate the race
Faces, basic smiles speak a thousand words
That go a million miles
Until we realize that we gotta stay true
Despite the lies, read between the lines
And move forward
Oh Lord
Heritage manifest in the color of the mane of our men and women
New born, blessed with natural melanin
Living and shine like filaments
Pitch black hair, rich black eyes
Capture the rapture of mother nature
Beyond Africa, Pan Pacifica, Antarctica to South America
Health before wealth in the kingdom of righteous
Fight until death do us part and I might just
Travel to the depth of the heart of Atlantis
Pledge to the state of the art so I plan this
Expedition as my mission all the while
Competition lose not knowing why
Til the day I chill in the east of the River Nile
Real skill, real deal never go out of style yeah

Who wanna test their blackness?
Let me guess, fake jocks frontin' like Loch Ness
Life blessed you to look the best
When you're dressed with less but cover the rest
Some kids with straight strands want dread locks
Some girls with a fro want to straighten their chops
It's all good we all grow out of it just like hair-do
You gotta vibe and flow with it just like air do
'Round the globe youth carry the hope
That one day everything's gonna be just fine now
Press rewind to a world color blind
Zero complex, find a space all mine
I grew up on the East Coast, opposite of Ivory
In the 21st, reckon economic slavery
Beyond Africa, Latin America, through Jamaica back to Japonica
Man and machine make the money that manipulate
Mind over matter meaning make moves to motivate
Before we globalize commercially
We need to mobilize community to spread the music with mercy
'Cuz exploitation is the blast from the past
Conversation help future visions last
Til the day I fill the post I'm supposed to live by
Real skill, real deal never go out of style yeah

Black is beautiful to me
Respect all state, all color, all race
Black is beautiful to me
One love, one god, one mind, one heart

INI, You and I, realize U-N-I-T-Y
INI, You and I, realize U-N-I-T-Y
Receive, Respect, Reflect
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on
Receive, Respect, Reflect
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on(chorus)
Blank paper makes me want to write
Silent moments, make me want to rhyme

(murs)
Now give me any instrumental combined with a pencil, and a blank sheet I guarantee that I create the beat
For them fools out there thinking that the underground don't got no heat
I'll come with some shit to run your punk ass up off the street
Thinking you an MC, more like maricon coward get devoured over tracks, get all up in your ass with these 12 inches of wax
Relax no need to be tense, as I dangle your career from a cliff can you feel the suspense?
And the next episode is the one where you fall from the top of the rap game
Hit rock bottom then your head explodes upon impact, you should listen to Murs first then rap
And if you feel you can come as tight then recite, if not the next best reply is silence
Typical American youth addicted to violence, especially if its verbal I'll be quick to make shit pop like a hot kernel nocturnal traveler
Supreme freestyle battler, the written is like my secondary
Wreckin' adversaries in a legendary fashion, nigg*s all up in the cypher holding on to punchlines like rations
Got me laughin' at these dumb rhymers, while I'm spittin' paragraphs to overwhelm their one-liners
Tryin' to come at me with combat with some shit you wrote a few weeks back
Soundin' like you need me to proofread you raps, you could fuck around and end your whole career like that
Just some shit to think about the next time you get up the nerve
Before you have to walk around forever known as the nigg* murs served...

(chorus)

(shing02)
My strategy is deeper than the deepest blue ever known in history
Forget playin' chess your mental tactics can't even dream to conquer tic tac toe
Your one-dimensional flow stuck in a 3x3 matrix, I play tricks mentally
Go down your root canal dentally and prove that your flossing is eventually coming obsolete in the 21st century
Shingo2 rippin' the mic like it was meant to be
Fatally, attracting opponents cause I'm hacking alien components with my operating system
Diss'ed them intellectuals with my mere existence, I'm sending out the virus no use for resistance
It's just the rap that I reveal, trap you like veal, throw pubic fools into miniscule cubicles
Elacerate your head right down to the cuticle, rearrange you like rubic cubes and then I shoot to kill
Lyrically cause rap does not need anymore violence, In all humbleness E22 move in silence
With or without a license Shingo ginzu slicin', I jump over the high fence of reality and glide since
I got infinite artillery, you try to run shit behind my back like Hillary, your input is auxiliary
Plus your grounded, not under-grounded so take your fake-ass style and put it back where you found it!
Flows go beyond synonyms pseudonyms and acronyms
My lyrical game makes the lame have acrobatic limbs, like Taekwondo
John Doe can stay at the condo, in silent moments staring at the blank paper!

(chorus)

(shing02)
Yeah it's fresh mc's are finally starting to be rhyming, not 2x-ing between mc and celebrity
Spending time and energy trying to look pretty, plus they can't even take one line of criti-cism
Add the word race now you got racism, eyes disecting light and skin colors like a prism
Finally escape this world full of mental prison, the word is with a capital h, He Is Risen

(murs freestyle)

(shing02)
If it ain't broke, don't try to remix it, And if your lyrics are wack, then we'll give you a fix-it

(chorus)Lord, if they only knew them nights it took
Burnt candles by the dozen to ignite the soul fire
Sheer energy to release to melt the heart
Mind starved, voice craved onto wax (and still get taxed)
Relax, unrest unless undressed to the core
Ever so slowly, wash away old skin like springs of sulfur
So far so good, what's life got to offer?
Youth stare curiously analyze the facts
Who's there to encourage give a pat on their back
How come society wanna grow and ignore small dreams
Big team, now every work is a chore
I adore each step, hop skip a cadence
Travel distant in the age of decadence
Do this in reverence to the older veterans
Stripes on their chest plus a chip on their shoulder
Street soldiers cut without severance
But keep hustling anyways for the L or the F of it
Effervescent light guide the way
Fear no evil, once lost now found
Like the last man down in the towering inferno of Babylon
First In Last Out

Thirstin' first drop just wet my appetite
But couldn't satisfy my craving for beats
Wrap tight like a Christmas gift
'Tis night is an eve for a generation to uplift
Live life like a testimony
Simple rhymes in difficult times help a friend
Through a lonely tunnel at the end
Every maze a funnel into a wine bottle
And corked inside a message so mind boggling, a puzzle
Amazed at the grace having reached a goal
Knock twice on the gate heaven preach a soul
True knowledge of self shine brighter than all
For one part getting polished you better the whole
The sum of the characters carry over your role
24-karat gold, each day is a jewel
Case closed when the end credits roll
Self-representative and elected, yes I
Give and get give back to the constituents
Sit you in a chair and break down the affairs
There's nuthin fashionable
About arriving late in the game and acting OG
Cuz you can't pay dues with credit or cash
Quicktime soft players streaming all the flash
So I'm sticking copper pins into media outlets
Then I hop up in a black van and I'm out
Let's get wit the program, shut the Dow Jonesing down
We keep underground dowsing
Microphones iron casting, everlasting sound
Blasting, no doubt
First In Last Out!

F.I.L.O, I'd rather do nuthin else
If I follow my heart to the last pulse
Like the last man down in the towering inferno of Babylon
First In Last OutIsland of happiness
Joy bliss and tenderness
Scenery heavenly
Hand picked delicacy
Grandmother's recipe
My mom's working on it
My friends tripping on the
Weekends it's gonna be a
Splendid springtime
We spend it in the sunshine
Easy on the fun I'm
Chilling like a wind chime
Let nature be our guide
Maybe we'll take a ride
Travel the countryside
View of the pacific tides
But on one march afternoon
A little before three on a Friday, boom
As the world got turned downside up in a soup bowl
Made everybody miss their rooms in a group home
Nests collapsed, trees flushed
Away, and left nothing
Had to be high and dry
Wet dolls with stuffing
Can't even blink when you don't have time to think
A lit wick on the brink of being extinguished in the wind
In the wind

The waves moved in with impunity
Unplugged the power and
Force quit the memory
A vacuum of community
Shaken foundation in a wake of a tragedy
Live communication for the sake of the families
A lost tribe gripping on mobile devices
What's the focus to be alive during a crisis, life is

Island of emptiness
Who could have thought of this
How could you ever miss
Something you forgot existed
When you least expect it
You can get disconnected
Try as you may
It's hard to remain unaffected
As the world wept another news swept in
Stole the headlines and
Sent ripples worldwide
Old plants crippled
Stems snapped like pickles
Seeds blew out pollens
Hot like popped kernels

The goodwill poured
From four corners of the globe
To help the S.O.S. in strobe
Oh the work to restore dashed hope and the strength to cope
With the cold facts to swallow till tomorrow
Image of catastrophe
Travel in telepathy
Push back the fears
Shed tears, and kill the apathy
We can reach out and each one
Teach one to fight the wicked things they bring being
Carried by the wind, by the wind

The rebuilding
Starts from the day you stand up and then decide to pick
Up a tool or you can read up on a book
This group has no symbols or an insignia
The axis we're placed on is linear
And our great heritage is circular
Divine and miraculous
Encourage every child
The entourage will be waiting for
Journey in a galaxy of trillions of planets tour
Places beyond far
And you might pass a shooting star
Fall in love, someday the cycle will continue
And you'll see the joy that I receive for seeing you in my timeline
See the joy that I receive for seeing you in my timeline

Refine the work we did, (ready set)
Define the thoughts we felt
Now is the time for us
Now is the time for us

Island of happiness
Joy bliss and tenderness
Scenery heavenly
Hand picked delicacy
Grandmother's recipe
My mom's working on it
My friends tripping on the
Weekends it's gonna be aChorus
I dedicate this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand isles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala with a myriad of guests...
Send this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand miles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala...

[Verse 1: Shing02]
A fine morning
Dew on web
Paper on steps
Hop outta bed
And let's get fed
A special day
Crease on legs
Collar on neck
Cuffs on wrists
Atop on my list
Or should I say mind
Runnin' em errands and checkin' on time
Since I don't wanna be late
For a chance to hug and congratulate
On everything and anything it's all love
Takin' in the stuff a good life is made of
Trees with the leaves give the seeds and the fruit
We can eat, feast, and drink on the juice
Cheese for the lenses, cheers with the friends
Here's to the peers who will stay till the end
And when I'm talking to the crowd like who's missing
Speak of the devil she sends me a text
Out and about, fixing up her dress
She sounds like a mess so I message her re: "don't worry be chill
But hurry if you will, don't miss a plate of bomb coconut curry"
She laughs it off like I'm catering jokes
And I'm savorin' the semi-colon-p that she wrote
I'm so proud I could prance on clouds
Nothin' in this world stresses me right now
Two hours pass and gettin' kind of antsy
Cruising the venue and ladies lookin' fancy
But all of that, disappear in a drop of a hat
I had to break in the middle of a chat
To comprehend the gravity of the
Moment the door parted
A monumental momentum shift in the whole set
A silhouette of a dress, burned to memory
Pop a mentos and mozy my way over to greet
An instant center of adulation
Undeniable infatuation
If it were in fact written, my gosh
Cause I must be smitten from the dome to my sole
And the role that you play is the star that is lone
In the play that you make incredibly your own
May I make a comment on the garb you have on?
Makes the rest just pale in comparison'
Magnificent texture, extraordinary
Very fly with the pattern, intricate embroidery
Nobody in the house can make it look better
Than the body inhabiting it, on the realla
Sorry if I'm overboard with the compliments
But I'm overcome with the sentiment
How I wish that I won't forget
The way her blush matches the bright character of her dress

Chorus
Yes, I dedicate this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand isles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala with a myriad of guests...
Send this poem to a valiant rose
Past an ocean of a hundred rows
Thousand miles in vermilion dress
Light up the gala...

[Verse 2: Shing02]
A fine evening
Trail on web
Pep in steps
Blocks ahead
Let's, she said
A young night
Clique in tow
Diner booth
In hoodies and sweats
Stroll outside
Bathe in lights
Feels different
With her in sight
The air she carries
A pocket of hearts
Sittin' face to face
With hands in place
Here's the deal
Mixed in with a dream
Well, I guess you could call it a scheme
But a scam, never that
Even in the oddest key
You are the goddess, see
Who got me on this odyssey
Honestly, I don't have the slightest clue
But I have a grand vision of what I aim to do
To hold you, in every part of the world
And having fun on the road, it won't ever grow oldMy vision 20 / 20 / 20
Nuff asaid, I can end it right now
But let me get my hit like pow!
Freaking heads like oh shit, mouth open like wow
'06 stop pretendin' like u dont know how
God damn it, which god should we ask
Can't we all get along, who we?
Huh not to say we ever did, but oowey
Oh how numb you gotta be to act dumb
When they take a candy away while u sucking your thumb
Stuck in a lump of mediocre runners, nope not in my camp
Gunners style, league hustle the champ
Ooh its getting closer to crunch and faces acting reptile
Cold blooded versus warm blooded in erectile
Position submission, u wishing u were rather fishing
But the kitchen full of hungry kittens itching for the ditching
Get your paper straight before the last leg taper
Blast off this planet code hyper

Lift the fog up
See thru the mock up
Real hook up
False flags pick up
Fly touch up
Can't stop us
Dirty coppers
And penny droppers
Get ya propers
Time to step up! lift the fog up
Press down push up
Keep ya chin up
Now put ya hands up
A la stick up
Dem can't stop us
Fad hoppers
And eavesdroppers
Get ya propers
Who gon' step up?!

Heart bindu, cobalt blue
Circulating all-city like a sold out brew
Already been thru rite of passage, paid dues
Collected notes hand to hand like a toll booth
Now I'm speedy gon' on etc
Etceteras stay behind like I feed these kids!
It's the saga of a leader but I heed the right message
So I be the one that beat the clock to the punch and
Hit the hole, score the golden goal and go to luncheon
Sound ascension, it's essential for the soul
I thought u knew, a plate of instrumental
On top of which I spill my beans like a lentil
Super fragile broken hearted mended with a stencil
Over the crack with a fat cap, wassup?
Blow whistle, danger than a DU missile
We won't let the flame fizzle
Like locking lips under the mistletoe bet ya spine sizzle

Lift the fog up
See thru the mock up
Real hook up
False flags pick up
Fly touch up
Can't stop us
Dirty coppers
And penny droppers
Get ya propers
Time to step up! lift the fog up
Press down push up
Keep ya chin up
Now put ya hands up
A la stick up
Dem can't stop us
Fad hoppers
And eavesdroppers
Get ya propers
Who gon' step up?!

So I talk weird, my flow's awkward, it's artwork!
Give it a mild chance, me spice is addictive
Nice wit a hint of vindictive
Attested by the audience, so receptive
Germ killer antiseptic so effective on immediate release
So free media dependency and u'll be able to see
Third eye sight, six, seven, eighth degree
My vision 20 / 20 / 20
Nuff said, I'mma end it right now[Produced by Dick Dawg]

[Hook]
If we can't make love
We can always make peace, can't we
If we can't make love
We can always make peace, can't we
If we can't make love
We can always make peace...

[Verse 1]
Can't we have a minute or two?
To come face to face ya know
Just name the place and
I'mma be there half an hour early
So I can feel the joy in my chest
While waiting for...
Even if you' re late a couple of ticks
It'll feel like forever to sit
In front of the building
Watch the crowd walk by and you're not in it
Doubt reach a limit
Then you surprise me
With your presence
The dopest present of all
Totally in awe
By the simple fact that you came
Plus you answered my call

[Hook]
My body love you like water
Dry land thirst to the highest order
Sweet memory saved on recorder
Two pal birds sitting on the border

[Verse 2]
So much on my mind and yet
Before I lay to rest I find the space to
Think about a long lost friend
Wherever the excitement went
So did the air and the heavenly scent
Now the stench of my own breath
Got me sucking on a fruit of death
Real life and debt around the world
Got me fiending on the times we spent
I don't know, how the two relate but they do, see
Believe you me
I never felt so wanted
Like a fugitive on a poster
But you already had me
Like a coaster on the bottom of a fine glass
Translucent the most
A reason to pass n' pour from a sealed bottle
We can crack shells like a pair of sea otters
Gaze like crystal
Geyser with the mineral
Rich with the natural gift

[Hook]
My body love you like water
Dry land thirst to the highest order
Sweet memory saved on recorder
Two pal birds sitting on the border
Now break it down like...[Intro: Bill Cosby]
I told you that story to tell you this one

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See ain't no mystery, the colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony!
Breathe life into dead space blow away clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely

[Hook]
Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice
For some words that have waited for way too long
Low wages, Small tips on the avenue
Never wasted, all hits for a revenue
Haven't you heard the news lately?
Seems we've been living for some time in a purgatory
But yo, I thought I knew what a love song sound like
But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight
I could still hear it in my room past midnight
Gotta move, take a solo cruise in the moon light
Sometimes I do forget, Oh how much we could ease the lives we lead
If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow
So you see, upon everyday faced there's a million shades to
Express definition of grace
But the method I choose my prerogative
There's so much love in me I got to give

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel
But how about this song that I wrote for you?
What I feel like...I wanna put my trusts in these simple words
For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together
Remember the time that you told me
In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to hold tight
Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house and
Realizes that you was my ace?
I was the joker on the stage singing the blues
All eyes on me and had nothing to prove
But yo, I thought I knew what a diamond shine like
But I felt a sharper love in the limelight
From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper deck balcony
Sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted live divine comedy
When I look back, that frozen slice of time and try to defrost the senses lost
Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation that I wrote this letter for
For you to know that the music helps carry on
Like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...

[Hook: x2]
Cause my beat plus your melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently

Cause your beat plus my melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidently
Cause your beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E eloquently so evidentlyI met a metaphorical girl in a metaphysical world
Now you got me day dreaming, sleeping in a curl
Her name on my tongue, a fresh flavor, yup
Whenever she popped up, put a swirl on my cone
I used to rap like I had some marbles in my mouth
But the stones turned precious when they all came out
On a string of deep thought that could never be bought
Body rock don't stop, be bop to hip hop
Cold as ice so I stared as it thawed to the floor
What was left a shoestring budget on call
Then these new styles came along
Some on to the next on some other hit, their own trip
Colors faded on airbrushed centerfolds, dated
Make you feel old and jaded
The goal was to make it and we made it but
We didn't know how to keep it
Like nice kicks. that wouldn't fit
Only way was to box it up and duct tape it up
Store it underneath the bed and open it up
Once in a blue moon
Think about a cool ending
To a story that ended too soon
Gotta bring back the feeling
I'll do anything not to be stuck on fiending
A pen can be sharper than a scalpel to a patient
To an open heart, it's a daily operation

After six come seven and eight
Access code to the pearly gates
They say heaven can wait
And you speak of fate
A finale to a play for my mate
I see the angels draw the drapes
Over the earthscape
Where the wine is the spirit of grapes
Gotta finish what we started, so I cut the tape
As our records will stay on rotate

You say a circle is a flawless shape
Every part equi-distance from the center
On the arc without a start or a finish
A line on a loop carries weight
A freight train runs unabated
Views vanish from my point vantage
Passages come in and out
The way I recall your antics (how I remember your antics)
Still alive cause I said it
A life of its own unless we dead it
Till they see our name in credits
A labor of love you mean slavery
Surely, it's been quite savory
Crepe on the balcony, verbal alchemy
Pure magic when she touches me
I read that love is kind but it's also blind of any style
You profess, would you be my guest (you could be my guest)
Happiness is a hot potato that you can't possess for long
Just pass it on like a song
And I might look calm and collected at a glance
But I taste the void when I'm not connected
To the world kinetic, as opposed to static
Idle hands a workshop of a digital addict (a modern-day addict)
On a hot streak for inspiration is key to feed
The mind in need of stimulation
Elevator music to the space station
Penthouse of stars a-blazing

After six come seven and eight
Access code to the pearly gates
They say heaven can wait
And you speak of fate
A finale to a play for my mate
I see the angels draw the drapes
Over the earthscape
Where the wine is the spirit of grapes
Gotta finish what we started, so I cut this tape

*() remix lyric[Hook: Shing02 (x2)]
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are

[Verse 1: Shing02]
Like a movie that you can't predict
Like a book that you can't resist
I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
Bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
Verbally that is, making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
With the whole city fast asleep, out cold
True words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
Of a poet in me, most powerfully
I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing
Trying to find a reason to work, god willing
I admit, my thinking is wishful
Like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the truth
To fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
On the analog player watch the people glow
Sit back to the breeze let the memories flow
Comedy tragedy all the highs and lows

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Like your moves that I can't predict
Like your look that I can't resist
The ting-a-ling feeling was oh so mutual
The lingering appeal was so unusual
Herbally what is, medicine to a lone soul can become poison to some
With the whole body fast asleep, out cold
True vision seem to come to the eye, take hold
Of a prophet in me most visibly
I see clear when the world doesn't show it to me
It's so hard to make sense in a cycle of billing
Trying to find a reason to quit and make a killing
I admit, our dealing is painful
Like a star upon a child staring down from the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the picture
Before pixelating the human texture?
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's save it all up for an ultimate prize
Homecoming gathering with a big surprise
Throw on your favorite record that's good to go
On the analog table and it's hooked to blow
Sit back with ease and hear the emcee flow
Hi hat kick drum all the highs and lows

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shing02]
Um, third time's the charm, hopefully
When I chime on your door you'd still let me in
After all these years
The room that you caved in my heart is exactly the same as you left it
I realize that you have moved on
New styles and cliques like them silent flicks
I'm speechless in this golden occasion
The beautiful expression on the silver creation
This time I'd like to keep in touch
I'm a little bit wiser, a whole lot tougher
If I suffer through another nightmare tonight
We'll chalk it up as another chapter to write, all right?
Or wrong or somewhere down the middle of the road
I wanna see you again in a scene with the backdrop a perfect ten
And the music can take us back to the spot right then
From black and white to a sepia tone
Some dreams come with a tint or in monochrome
From black and white to my skin tone
Some dreams have a stint on the microphone

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Shing02]
Okay we can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite jacket and you're good to roll
On the analog trail and you look the role
Just stroll through the trees and let your miseries go
Sunshine hurricane all the highs and lows

We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite[Hook]
Snow flakes in January
Heart warm like February
I wouldn't ordinarily
March to the drum, play a fool like April
May the best dance in a Juno bridal
Power of the will, Julius and Augustus
Aw you know, it's just us
In a new semester, back in September
Boy, I wonder if you still remember

[Verse 1: shing02]
Meet me half way from mars to venus
Beep beep, the chase is on between us
Retweet the sweetest piece of confection
Hand made device for remote connection
Ask a question
Wait for an answer and make a suggestion
A time and a place for a first impression
Second and third to a fourth dimension
Rise above the weights that hold us captive
To a square, swear that I, I the captain to
Cruise in sci-fi, red sky burn like sapphire
A moth to a fire, but we can fly higher
Till we reach an apex
We fit tight like a glove with the latex
Bring it down to earth for a cooling session
Laying sideways and glazed in essence
Gazed each other in the eye to find galaxies of
Uncharted nebulas
Heard joy over spilled milk on a quilt, of lavender
Woven in the fabric of our calendar
Dress up at the end of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Hook]

[Verse 2: shing02]
When you took my hand, I couldn't hide it
Way too delighted
Tried to ride it cool but obliged to write it
Wouldn't fight it, how my watch paused
When I put my lips on your eyelids
The lost second, deposit in a memory bank
Every chance I pocketed a cent
A blank check with ya signature
Font sans serif, the curvature, a lone harbinger
With toys play coy like fish in a pond
Fond words serve poems like dish
Life is short like a doggone leash
Or a fuse in an open circuitry
That got struck by lightning
Hang a painting on the wall over the writing
Brighten up the room for a private dining
Increase the peace and cease the anxiety
Spread love and cc: the whole society
You got me shooting off on a tangent
Like I always do when I'm on the fringe
And the tally of the letters will reach
The valley where the wings will seek
A series so classic at the top of October
Give thanks to the fam in November
A cold but cozy December
And we're back to the origin, so let me begin

[Hook]Till death do us apart, and it did
Come sudden like clouds, and it hid my sun
My truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let them whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

In your last breath you told me, that you had to go
Cause it pained you so
Oh I loved you so much so
Was I selfish to hold on
And cling on to your body that hosts a soul
That wanted to set free the eagle in a cage
And you became eagerly what I wanted to be
You the person to leave, I the person
To see off another best friend to land's end
I watched grown men moan, and women weep
As you quietly descended six feet deep
But the spirit ascended before our wet eyes
A gift from god, returned to sender
Though I like to pretend that this never happened
I can turn around and see you laughing
But the fact is you could never practice
Getting blind-sided and eating the wind shield
Endless field of shards of glass
This too shall pass, but reality bites, it says not so fast
First you must climb a calvary of shattered hopes
And then a mountain of prayers unheard
'till you reach that peak where you can see the dark abyss below
Then you let me know if you have what it takes for a leap of faith
I had to say, hell no, heaven yes, but not yet
Please bless a forehead, cold in a bed
Or alone on the road with nobody to hold
When the pouring rain is too much to bear
It's a reason to live for a seed that needs care

Till death do us apart and it did
Come sudden like clouds and it hid my sun
My truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let it whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Now I hit this stage in honor of you
How's the other side, I bet it's a splendid view
No more stress for rent, or to make ends
Collide in a cocktail, shame with envy
I can hide behind lens that block the UV
Looking in from the outside the bowl is murky
The toll for the bridge is rising
Weatherman says storm, city hall is burning
Same ol' chaos, gotta shut my cell like I'm waiting to take off
On the runway, scoping out the window
The moisture covers the sight though
Telling myself it's just another day in the life of a starving artist
Trying to paint a dream you woke from
Chasing the departed
We used to hang by the banks to see who can skip a stone the farthest
What I thought was a stream is now an ocean
No such thing as an extreme to show devotion
To your craft, which I didn't know the half
Tried to knock down your door and caught the backdraft
And a whiplash, all in reverse
Then I finally stood up and said, we reserve the right to serve anyone
And on the same note you deserve the best of the most fun
By the way I got your letter, you said you were fed up
Well I second that and I reckon that you tried
So I don't place a blame that you took the fifth
And the first flight out of town, into the mist

Till death do us apart and it did
Come sudden like clouds and it hid my sun
Your truth heavier than imagined, a lid die-cast in lead
On our lives we nourished
And the days we cherished as kids
We let 'em whizz on by, but when I rewind
Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Your smile is the only thing that comes to mind
Your smile is the only thing that shines

Whether a tree lives to see the end of centuries
Or a random hand picks it instantly
Life is art, a miracle for all to see
I must tell you that you lived beautifully[Verse 1: Shing02]
Once again, now where do I start, dear love
Dumb struck with the pure luck to find you here
Every morn' I awake from a cavernous night
Sometimes still pondering the previous plight
Seems life done changed long time no speak
Nowadays I often forget the day of the week
Taking it by stride if you know what I mean
No harm done, no offense taken by me
So let's rap, we'll catch up to par, what's the haps? Perhaps we're even closer
Now after, all things considered on this side of the planet
Couldn't pick a better time even if we planned it
To come clean and candid if I have to
Oh what I wouldn't trade for your laughter
Sweet and sour spice in my poetry pot melting
Even better than the real thing
It's like the God in me saw the devil in you
I wanted to break myself in the worst way when I met you
Who would have thought, conversate by the river, celebrate birth
Sit and delivered the lines that would prove to be the seeds of trust
Unsigned, yeah but destined to grow with sunshine
Self-assigned task piled on the desk of good works
Knowing hardship appreciate the best of both worlds

Chorus
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E evidently, see every song has a sequel
Never same, everything but the name, all fresh just like back then, how we do everyday
C'est la vie, as they say L-O-V-E eloquently, see every dream has a part two
Never same, you got to keep it tight, always just like back then, now hear me out

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Once together, now where do we go, dear divine
I pray that you keep watching over us
From the heavens where light is the nucleus
To this space filled with darkness and negative matter
Anti-gravity pull is what I would rather, feel when I leave this shell eventually
Ties to the mother earth ground me mentally
Real vibes will keep me alive spiritually
Imagination brings bliss at no cost, when I blink blink I receive at no loss
Victory comes in small packages like a leaf of an olive tree brought back by a dove
From above, then I'm gonna rhyme love
Well you saw that one coming ever since the beginning of the end
Well anyways, I am not a perfect being, yes I am, a man full of S-I-N
It's like the devil in me saw the God in you
You epitomize the etymology of enthusiasm
Look it, up there lies the clouds that form the rain
That came from the ocean that flowed from the river
I'm a believer, firm with the first words, lyrical transceiver of our ancient roots
Science plus Arts multiplied by Faith then divided by the number of our ethnic race
Let me mention what I've been thinking
How to save the children, when the ship is sinking
So I'm singing, no lip syncing to slogans
Political hooligans with tanks, missiles and guns
Everything is relative when it's all in the family of man
Understand the time has finally come to realize the great power of one
All formulas equalize under the Sun, amen

[Bridge]
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
All good souls lost may they rest in peace


[Bridge]
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Your vibe surely brings out the best in me
The rhymes will heal cause I believe in music
In times of need I won't be leaving you sick
The beat plus the melody's the recipe
Hip-hop world wide we got to live in peace, like thatMusical Instrument, Divine Interface
Miditate over music in this infinite space

So I flip through the torn pages of memoirs
This long story short script, film to screen
Raw & unedited, the director's cut
Uncooked tossed salad of emotes from the gut
Like what it feels to be the protagonist in agony
Tagging these lines in ignorance is...
Luckily I survived through the loneliness
Only this time to find a friend in myself
But enough about me, me, me
Let's talk about what this brother over here
Can do with that brother over there
If they only cared and bothered to
Look past the indifferences
Discrepancies in point of references
What we perceive life through our five senses
Phenomenal world bring the experience in
Full color 3-dimensional well-being
Straight up, music is my faith
It's my way of calling god's name
Without knowing his or her face, or vice versa
Live spectacle with no rehearsal
To recreate long-lost heaven on earth
Universal soldiers equipped with wisdom
Respond beyond call to build the kingdom
Starved bodies and minds we've got to feed'em
Fear not, keep straight the path to freedom!

[HOOK]

Like a virgin flight to the moon on the tube
Innocence lost all too soon
Unto whom it may concern very dearly
Like a diary in the attic had it been
Frank like an anatomical analysis
Of a pulsating organ longing for a new sound-scape
On the tape demonstrate strapped with a hot beat
Cause the prince of peace goes to war with heat
To restore order, in this concrete rubble
Steel column enforced still crumbled to the asphalt
Never will be solid as a rock
The whole land shook yet no evidence of a fault
The sharp fall of the stock of the beast preceded
By a series of sign o' the times unheeded
Frail balance on the beam from the outer
Domain of the host of a chance encounter
We're souls with real deficit of affection
Bar none, kick start the session
For a destined vision of an uprise, unite the untied
Our dream defies
Any convention center full of schemes
We got the conviction
Enter for the fiend
The means to let the vocal heard in all of the units and
Global herd we nod in unison!
As simple as a dope hit y'all relate
As pretty as a dimple in a smile that'll make
My day go smoother than a baby's cheek
Stimulate my mind like a motherhuggin' chi
Epitome of an energy
That I wanna emulate
If not, then yeah, just to have you elate
Cause it's never too late
For the sake of love to create!

[HOOK]

Inhale fresh air full of natural vibes
Exhale all the trouble that's weighing my mind
Inhale new day, another lesson in life
Exhale all the camouflaged pain and strife[Intro]
This is a sad song
But also a pretty one, female, you know
And, um... since it's been a minute
I thought I'd write you something
And I'll make it short
I promise

[Verse 1: Shing02]
It's much harder to keep a promise
Than a secret, that I know
Cause the hands of time
Will change things in ways you couldn't predict
When you're young and innocent, so right
Until proven otherwise by those misty eyes
Staring over the waters
Dreaming of blue skies
And distant isles, miles away
But close to her heart
Like the charm on her necklace
Getting restless
How she laid by my side
Singing her favorite songs and lullabies
Had to meet by fate
So didn't say good bye
See you laters, better days in sight
We glorify life as we know it as an open book
Blank pages turn to filled ones
We took the scenic route to the train station
Let the clock pass with a conversation
Dear fellow traveller, drifting through the city
Like a seasonal wind from another city
Ooh she's an infectious groove
Once subjected to, be aroused and soothed
A tone rings hollow if I can't forget, but...
Luck follows where the hope is kept
So I set my goal and continue to step
O que e que aconteceu con nossa promessa

[Hook: Shing02]
Oh promete me
That you'll wake in bliss
Even if it's not next to me
Everyday I miss that zone
We caressed, yes
Very special like our first kiss
When nothing else mattered
But the sound of the lips mixed with the
Pound of the beat matched with the
Wave of the heat
Alleyways to the busy streets
From the concrete hills to the hidden beach
Our songs will reach
Rest assured
Treat each hour like the last I can afford
What's for sure
Best friends, we were made for
And yet trade speech like
Lovers on opposite shores

[Verse 2: Shing02]
Like somewhere between scared and sacred
No lie, when I saw her naked
In the dark, sucked my air out like a vacuum
Never before, pale shades of gray meant more
To the lens
Hunger for real warmth evident
The thunder, a shock to kill for, heaven sent
Now understand that
My core yearns for raw touch
My soul has a hole, like a donut
That only she can fill
And I can feel her vibe enter
Hit the tender spot
Soft like chords on a fender rhodes
This year, I'll send her an electric rose
So who knows, that's how it goes
Beyond columns and rows, x's and o's
Yesterday I ran into a mutual pal
And he asked me, where in the world is she now?
My fellow traveller, the girl was the city
After she was gone, felt like any other city
All that was left behind, asymmetry
Your guess is as good as mine
No two will last long without trust
Thrust to the gut much stronger than lust
So I set my goal and continue to bust
O que e que aconteceu con nossa promessa

[Hook: Shing02]
Oh promete me
That you'll wake in bliss
Even if it's not next to me
Everyday I miss that zone
We caressed, yes
Very special like our first kiss
When nothing else mattered
But the sound of the lips mixed with the
Pound of the beat matched with the
Wave of the heat
Alleyways to the busy streets
From the concrete hills to the hidden beach
Our songs will reach
Rest assured
Treat each hour like the last I can afford
What's for sure
Best friends, we were made for
And yet trade speech like
Lovers on opposite shores[Scratch Intro]
"One, One, One"

[Verse 1]
This is just a little rap song
Built upon a simple note
Other styles are bound to follow
But the root is still hip-hop (hip-hop)
Now this new one is the consequence
Of the one we've just been through
As I'm bound to be the unavoidable consequence of you
There's so many rappers who can rap and rap and rap
And just say nothing
Or really nothing
They have used up all the styles we know
And at the end we've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into this one mic
All the love I feel for you ("...one love")
Anyone who wants the whole show
Let him be the one fo sho
He will find himself with no show
Better go for what you know

[Scratch Hook]
"MCs act like they don't know"
"...What?" "One love!"

[Verse 2]
There's so many rappers who can spit and spit and spit
And just say nothing
Or really nothing
They have used up all the styles we know
And at the end we've come to nothing
Or nearly nothing
So I come back to my first note
As I must come back to you
I will pour into this one mic
All the love I feel for you
Anyone who wants the whole show
Let him be the one fo sho
He will find himself with no show
Better go for what you know[Verse 1: Shing02]
One People

People call us naive, backwards petwater bottle rocket science
March with them picket signs made of pizza boxes
Oxytocin intoxins
Drum circle live from zuccotti park to the port of oakland
Where did they come from, comfort of their homes
Take it to the red zone, rubber bullet to the dome
Suckers spying the web like they used to tap phones
Hellfire missiles dropped by predator drones
700 billion a year for defense huh
More like offensive on the 99 percent that
Still shop at stores named 99cents
So I'llchip in my two for the popular dissent

[Hook]
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

This one's for
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

[Verse 2: Shing02]
I Get off the couch to the parade to the general assembly
Springing up like bamboo shoots in monsoons
Fooled once, duped twice, bamboozled for strikes
It'stime for your conscience to put up a fight
Motherhuggers,real lovers know what it's worth, yes
Price tags can't have enough zeroes to purchase
Every little thing that you can bake in your pie
You can try to divide but impossible like pi
Occupy this speech, besieged
Land property seized improperly
You can break the monotony
Bored of living on a board of monopoly
This game of life is still odd to me
A dream is a lot less brighter than it ought to be
Poverty spread like a tumor on top of the
Average income pulling household economy
Taxed out the gate, gotta topple the authority
Truth almighty on this side of the barricade
Doesn't matter which one us you interrogate
Wanna bet what changed since the watergate
Juliet told Romeo to serenade

[Hook]
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

This song's for
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people

[Verse 3: Shing02]
So my power point being are we ever gonna have
Peace of mind, body, and soul
Not likely if remotely controlled by the psyche of the flag
Shipping off labors and disturbing our neighbors
Distributing rations of irrational behavior
Trapped in an orthodox, looking for a savior
He ain't second coming when u guessing his name
Xavier onassis, minute hour day month year time elapses
Neuron fire lapses
The war intensifies overseas white lies
Life of a butterfly, better yet a sacrifice lamb burger
Lettuce and tomato on top with the curly fries
Hot sauce burn your upper lip
Truth makes you bite your tongue
Here's a serum take a sip
Real activists show more heart than a click of a hactivist
Who cares about evidence of relevance
Self-governance or face detriment
Let freedom ring Tahrir to Tiananmen
So would you keep mum when they hush
Or would you paint your own picture with a brush
So would you keep dumb when they crush
When your button is pushed

[Hook]
By the people
By the people
By the people
One people

This one's for
For the people
For the people
For the people
For the people
One people
