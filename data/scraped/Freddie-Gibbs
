[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stüssy Bape camo
With a cutie espanol, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had on leggings and sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando, ‘cause her momma got cancer
She can’t work in the states because her green papers ain’t legal
Fuck Obama un peso, she be like grande un peso
Push the molly un peso, so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that depot
She can’t lose she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Nepo
Meanwhile I could be ruler, and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, can she get molly, so bicurious off her friends though
Cause I'm feeling birdy like nerdy but he be after the bando
She pop 30's for Birdy, now Birdy's up to her head tho'
Hold on I think I see Birdy, and Birdy killed my Cuban ho...[Intro]

[Outro]
Yeah, so you niggas supposed to ride[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1]
Niggas be like "Fred, you ain't never lied"
Fuck the rap shit, my gangsta been solidified
Still do my business on the side
Bitch, if you polices, then pay me no nevermind
I was thuggin' - Black and red laces in my number threes
Take a pull up off the wood and let that motherfucker breathe
Sit outside a busta crib and let that motherfucker leave
Walk his ass back in and put him on his motherfuckin' knees
Thuggin' - Never takin' no for an answer
Might just take a loss, but bitch, I’d rather take my chances
This liquor got me lurkin' where you live at in the night time
59Fifty to the left, but I'm in my right mind
Thuggin' - Pants gon' be saggin' til I'm 40
Still lyrically sharper than any short bus shawty
Phonies ain't gon' throw me in this minstrel show
These labels see how far up in they mouth my dick can go
So go'n and, choke on this meat, throw my song on repeat
Might move away one day, but I'm always gon' belong to the streets

[Break]
I'm straight thuggin'
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'

[Verse 2]
Selling you the science of the street rap
Every motherfuckin' show I do is off the meat rack
I done been to jail and did my best not to repeat that
I’m tryin to feed my family, give a fuck about your feedback
Critically acclaimed, but that shit don't mean a thang
When you rocking mics and stealing microwaves, cooking 'caine
Never trippin' on a dame, I'm too cold for you broke hoes
Don't let the knob hit your booty when the door close, bitch
She let me hit it cause I'm thuggin'
Squares need not apply, I'm so fly I might fuck her cousin
Swiftly 'bout to stick a sweet dick in your sweetheart
Then get some groceries off my geeker EBT card
Why the feds worried 'bout me clocking on this corner
When there's politicians out here getting popped in Arizona?

[Break]
Bitch I'm thuggin'
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'

[Verse 3]
"We’re not against rap, but we're against those thugs"
Can't be legit when every nigga in your clique sold drugs
Predicate felons in my faculty, real killers can vouch for me
Teach a kid at the crib or your children might cop an ounce from me
And smoke out in the Chevy with us
Cause in the past, my low-class black ass would serve my own fucking family members
I hate to say it, ain't no need to be discreet
If she don't cop from me, she get it from a nigga up the street
Cause he thuggin'
And yo, she'd probably suck his dick for it
She turnt out so it ain't shit to turn a trick for it
My uncle last bitch put him on the glass dick
Tried to rob a man to feed his habit, he got blasted
I live on borrowed time, my expiration date I passed it
So lock me up forever, but this shit is everlastin'

I'm thuggin'
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
And it feels so good, and it feels so right
Cause mothafucka I'm thuggin'[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1]
Slammin', half a thang of heron in the bathroom
Keep an AK and the backup, in the backroom
Cook a meal clean and she suck me, like a vacuum
Took a vacation to the county, I'll be back soon
Sent a couple zero's, money on my J pay
Payin' off the CO's, smokin' on the gateway
Word around the block, when I was locked
She gave my thang away
'Bout to have a baby with a nigga, that's what they say
Damn, well, please say, it ain't so
Took off the glove, say it's love, when it ain't though
Her classmate was comin' over, that was strange though
Apparently the homework ain't all he came for
Maybe you stank ho, maybe that's a bit mean
Maybe you grew up and I'm still living like I'm sixteen
Like a child running wild in these sick streets
Man, I put that bitch up on her feet, she cut a nigga deep

[Break]
Damn, bitch, that's why I treat these hoes the way I treat them
That's deeper than a motherfucker, baby
You know what I'm saying? Uh

[Verse 2]
Slammin', smack it up and flip it, then I rub it down
Zip it up and then I ship it, to another town
Smoking hella weed, while me and Willie bust a couple pounds
She used to like that type of shit, now we don't fuck around
Girl, you used to say them other niggas wasn't hood enough
Got your lil degree, now niggas from the hood ain't good enough
Bitch, you wasn't trippin' when that old school was pullin' up
You was short on ends at your college, who would put them up?
Well, bitch, I'm out here puttin' on
I hope you feel the pain I'm feelin', when you hear this song
Don't want a nigga that's gon' slang shit up in your home
But you ran off and got engaged, man, that shit was wrong
All to a nigga that don't got nothin' that I ain't got
Only difference is, he tryna be a fuckin' astronaut
Saw this pussy nigga when I walked up in the barber shop
Green as a leaf, lookin' sweet, that cut a nigga deep

[Break]
Damn, so these type of niggas you fuck with now, baby?
You know what I'm saying?
Square ass motherfucker, you used to love a thug nigga
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Uh, I loved her and she loved him, so I never touched him
She's got his baby in the oven, so it's mother fuck him
Ain't trippin' cause you got a nigga, I just think you rushin'
But leavin' him, to be with me, ain't part of our discussion
Plus I'm on the road now, different color hoes now
Layed back on the dope, I'm getting dollars off my shows now
Bitches wanna tie me down, but I ain't in that mode now
Five years later, why you calling up my phone now?
Uh, well, bitch, how you get the number?
Like every other month, I'm switching up that motherfucker
Back on the bus, I used to finger fuck her, singing Usher
Down on my luck and then she upped and left me for a sucker
I reminisce on all the crazy shit we did
You and me forever, shit we'd say when we was kids
She say, I'm havin' problems and I pray that he forgive
When he find out the baby ain't his, that cut a nigga deep

[Outro]
Damn, what the fuck? So, what you tryna say, baby?
Baby ain't his, whose is it? Uh, yeah[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1]
I keep a chip off in my cell phone
Pocket full of stones, smoking on the strong
Freddy Kane, Freddy Corleone
Marshalltown niggas had a nigga running home
I call collect get me a 38, now bitch is on
9 millimeter, Baretta to 40 cal
Glock 23 fresh up out the box, bitch I hold it down
I hit the stroll with a  chili bowl and a crooked smile
Fast forward ten years came back with Roley's with golden crowns
Skinny nigga
Six wing mild sauce
With all the fries you can give me
I tear them bitches off
Ski mask on yo baby daddy?
Well that's that nigga loss
Pointin' my trey five seven, I got my point across

[Hook]
A skinny nigga
Six Wing Mild Sauce
With all the fries you can give me
I tear them bitches off
This burning hole in my pocket
Got me out here flippin' soft
Two-Twenty-Three on my enemy
I tear them bitches off
A skinny nigga
Six wing mild sauce
With all the fries you can give me
I tear them bitches off
A plate of chicken with the bread stuck to the bottom
Fuck my enemies what you looking for bitch I got 'em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Fuck my enemies what you looking for bitch I got 'em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Fuck my enemies what you looking for bitch I got 'em

[Verse 2]
KFC, Harolds, Sharks and Popeyes
Adidas suit with a plate of chicken, got mob ties
A fresh Delt', weed crumbs on my plush seats
I got my license now I'm backseat fucking every week
A thick bitch live in Miller, go to work
3:30 school was out then I was fresh under her skirt
Them project niggas hit that bitch, that pussy went berserk
Don't hit without that Trojan, fuck around you might get burnt
She was raised in the church, turnt out in the ghetto
Lock it, pussy pop it, I swear this bitch deserve a medal
Seen school girls turn into strippers in stilletos
Pimpin' ’til I die, if you wanna stop then get ya shovel bitch
Extra sauce with the bread stuck to the bottom
Freddie Forgiato, all my bitches spoiled rotten
Cop that llama, got the hollows poppin' out the barrel
Got a stain for them hubbas meet me at the Harolds, bitch

[Hook]
A skinny nigga
Six wing mild sauce
WIth all the fries you can give me
I tear them bitches off
A plate of chicken
With the bread stuck to the bottom
But fuck my enemies what you looking for bitch I got 'em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Fuck my enemies what you looking for bitch I got 'em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Bitch, bitch I got ‘em
Fuck my enemies what you looking for bitch I got 'em[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Live like 9-5, I rhyme and come alive
My grind divides fine through my divine eyes
It's prime time, you wish you could buy time, but it's my time
Thoughts against I, blasphemy, it's like a vice crime
I roll 'em thick and I ignite mines
I don't even get high, I just get equally back in my right mind
I'm getting lethal with these nice lines
Creeping through your speakers
Catch you sleeping like a thief of in the nighttime
Young Doms, none of you niggas correspond, bitch
Kick the fuck out of the track on some Jean-Claude shit
Get the fuck out of the streets, nigga, I bomb shit
Shit ain't all good no more, y'all on your con shit
The fuck is your conscience? Testing me is nonsense
The whole city is mine, I'm the best up in my conference
Ain't feeling me, fine, ain't gotta listen to my shit
You can hear about me from the critics all on my dick

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch, I've been thugging since the motherfucking Ten Speed
Redbone on my handlebars, I like my bitches mixed breeds
Feel the Philly tighten with a 20 sack of stress weed
Educated, at the stove I'm working recipes
Reputation say I'm robbing just for recreation
Revive my enemy with gun-to-mouth resuscitation
Can't wait to this pussy nigga pay me, I'm impatient
Let's go kick in their door and strip them naked, leave 'em stinking
No witness, no weapon, my nigga, the case is over
The reaper snatched 'em, closed casket, his family needs a closure
And Moses had ten commandments, Huey had ten points
Won't see my homie for ten, dropped him off at the joint
Staring at my future in my rear-view
Family cried some tears, I got some years, it ain't no issue
Mama with the tissue
Saw her breaking down, she just might cry a river
Murder one, she can't believe she raised that type of nigga

[Verse 3: G-Wiz]
I tried to do right, but it only got your boy fucked in the game
So I changed my mind, now I'm back on this grind
Trying to get this change
Niggas hate to see me getting it
Travelling packs with a red dot
Boy, it ain't your knot, trying to get what you got
When the rain and the pain gon' stop
Standing on the porch early, no shoes, selling blow in my socks
And I was watching for the ghetto bird
Ain't got no money for college
So all I know is how to sack and how to serve
I be damned if I miss another lick for the chips
Got me stacking, almost splurging on weed, syrup and whips
Niggas around my way be loving it
I'm Cadillac'ing, blowing good alligators with the belts to match
I got an ounce with an ounce to match, bust it down, get back
Hopefully maybe get the clique out the trap
I need dough like a bread baker (Amen)
24/7, got ready on the turf, player
All day

[Verse 4: Casey Veggies]
Make 'em hop in the new coupe
Niggas been winning, that ain't nothing new
Forgive me for the sinning that they be doing in this business
Not using their words to express truth
Out in the streets with a screw loose
On the Westside I got the juice
Just tell me what you trying to do
She loving the crew and ain't fucking with you
I go where the hood niggas get into it
I go where the bad girls go shop
Every window tinted but the rooftop
That money I'll just spend it to get you shot
Can they be hating, they got no reason
Right where they got me, the place I Delete 'em
We kicking on weaklings just for all of their secrets
I can't believe the shit that I'm seeing
I'm hearing the words, doing my reading, it's really absurd
Not enough leaders, the shit that they feed you, it's just what you eating
They call me young Veggies, I make it go green
I smash in all your teeth, the fuck is you saying?
You got the candy's, the niggas is spraying
To get away and take over the land, yeah

[Verse 5: Sulaiman]
My mind on capital, I'm not just rapping, dude
I'm out to speak actual factual, watch how a master moves
You ball a fist what that gon do
I'm from a city clapping fools
You off the tit and lacking while watching me fashion stools
Shitting styles, you never had a hot line that I didn't dial
Little princes always trying to fit a bigger crown
But don't forget I sit amidst some seasoned gents
Them bitches knowing he a pimp ain't even need to read the blimp
It was a good day, good day to O'Shea
A death certificate for anyone who lay in my way
You best revisit all the tombstones that lay in my wake
Me being knowledge, be honest
You seen the prophet get sacrificed by the opps
It get ratchet when ratchets out and they firing
Residue on piñatas, wonder what's up inside of 'em
It's sure ain't no Vicodin cause it up and excited 'em
But they ain't get high enough, if you ain't succeed, nigga
Buy again then try again

[Verse 6: Meechy Darko]
It's the irrational type of nigga to John Madden tackle you
Steal your car keys and crash your coupe in the botanical
Wrap you with shackles, tangle you, pull from ever angle, dismantle you
Watch your blood mixed with mud and stain the gravel too
Grab and shoot, rib cage open like a parachute
Close range, switchblade, poke 'em if it's personal
Blood stains, gold fangs, mask on, no traits
Murder one, closed case, stolen whip, no plates
Half a body in the trunk, go to prison, no way
Speed off the Brooklyn Bridge before I catch a cold case
Realize I'm the voice for those who do not have a voice
So I voice my fucking voice, I don't have a fucking choice
Cold blooded, leave some niggas, well I hope you got insurance
Shotgun and shorty lift 'em like the potent in my joint
Barrels smoking like Red Auerbach
Still can't believe I'm getting fed on rap
I don't know what's louder, the pack or the gat

[Verse 7: Mac Miller]
My endorphins are morphin', absorbin' energy
Original copy, A Tale of Two Cities gets read to me
Reading Emerson novels, eating some Belgian waffles
Some powder go up my nostrils, my dick going down her tonsils
What's up? Play with an abacus, I've been stressing like Catholics
That's the shit, a bit of that happiness in my cup
This generation corrupt, these people brainwashed with evil
My music is more cerebral, exploring just what you need to
So this your exodus, Church of the Methodist
Beating up the pussy, have her screaming like a exorcist
(*scream sample*)
Absorb it through your pores, the Lord with horns, a world war
Whores are more hors d'oeuvre  when it's a world tour
O'Doyle rulesReady to kick your ass out of the world

[Verse 1]
Remember everybody ain't loyal
You soft as gelatin, sick of telling them, nigga show 'em
It's coca in the pot, nigga drop it and let it boil
Goofy niggas make me nervous, ain't serve 'em if I ain't know 'em
Eastside, sleeping in my dope house clothes
Run down pair of Jordans and some dirty Girbauds
Sucker coming with a short, he get extorted, exposed
Nigga stand on my own two balls, my dick and ten toes
Straight to the tippy top
Hear this nigga spitting it, whether I got a hit or not
I hit it with the whip, they notice it when they hit the rock
I'm just a cocaina chemist
Cooking, chopping and cutting, you'll die if I push a button
Niggas heard of me, now all of a sudden they back to thugging
If I never sell a record might catch me hot water juggin'
The D.A. want me gone, say I'm detriment to the public
Took his daughter, put this dick in her butt
And said "how you love it, bitch?''
Remember everybody ain't loyal
Cause all the real niggas in jail or deep in the soil
Dancing with the devil or eating fish with the Lord
Gotta spit it how I live it, I beat the street and report, nigga
All the real niggas either in jail or deep in the soil, nigga

[Verse 2]
The world ain't big enough for both of us
Batter up, now you pussy niggas getting fucked
Straight raw with infection, passing no prophylactic
Eastside, anybody killa, my niggas active
Smoking and breaking a 7 up in a 6-5-0
Babyface Gangsta I been slanging, banging since 9-4
I thought the world was at my feet when I linked up with Snow
But I refuse to be his flunkie, so we don't kick it no mo'
Straight to the facts, nigga
I looked up to you, put that on my momma
Signed a deal with you and never asked you for a dollar
Cause I was down with CTE, plus I was getting cheese
I played my fuck ass contract, what the lick read?
Thought I'd say this shit cause you ain't man enough to come discuss it
You wanna be Jay-Z? Nigga you just a fucking puppet
Gary boys ain't 'bout talkin', so bitch I had to show ya
Don't make me expose you to those that don't know ya
Man you said you the realest nigga in this motherfucker, check it
But Ross had you scared to drop a diss record
No nuts, got the whole team looking weak
Guess that's why they ran up on you at the BET
L.A. red carpet, yeah, I was geeked
You couldn't take security, so we ain't take a seat
I played the fool before, but yo a ho I'll never be
They searched that tour bus in Milwaukee, had that .44 with me
ESGN and to the end, I feed the killers
Pray the Lord'll take my breath before I be like this monkey nigga
Just a whole lot of rapping, but no motherfucking action
Seen Gucci by himself while we was 30 deep at Magic
And you didn't bust a grape, was shook from the gate
It make it seem to me the gangsta shit you kick be fake
Cause all my enemies, I put them suckers in their place
So take them shades up of your eyes, and look me in my fucking face
Cause I'm a motherfucking rare breed
The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again
Don't reproduce nothin' but evil seeds
I'm rapping and trapping and still ducking these F-E-D's
But BMF was sticking you for your fucking cheese
And yeah I know you sold the blow and whipped the hard
But underneath the fucking money you's a fucking mark
Take heed to my statements, because they might throw you
Don't make me expose you to those who don't know you
Bitch
Snowman Killa[Verse 1]
I grew up wishing my life would be like the Cosbys
I go that extra mile to escape this ghetto monotony
See how this vicious cycle could fuck wit you psychologically
You best cooperate with the state or become they property
Bitch my name be ringing bells from the street to the jailhouse
And it ain't no transaction unless I came wit my scale out
Roll in yo college, I just might fuck up and fail out
Fucking bitch after bitch, stacking my chips, all I care bout
Fuck a GPA, bitch I need a CPA, come and count it up
Thousand thugs be always tryna catch him in a crowd around the bus
Guess it's bout to go down, if you down to fuck, then you down wit us
I know hoes that won't smoke, but stay sloppy drunk and get powdered up
This Corporate Thug World, they like you but they love the realest
Straight Gary gangsta shit, didn't come up off no fucking gimmicks, bitch
2Pac ain't back cuz he got set up and shot in the chest
Biggie ain't either, so won't y'all gon let them niggas rest?

[Hook]
I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I'm hard to kill like Steven Seagal wit yo fucking troops
Yo choppas ain't chopping shit if yo niggas ain't down to shoot
And I'm ready to R.I.P. any nigga that y'all recruit
Cuz I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I speak a foreign language, I think y'all call that the truth
It's Gibbs, bitch

[Verse 2]
A walking 187, 187 crazy
Sick like Moammar Gadhafi, straight 187 babies
I reach for that reefer stench and my shit knocking Brotha Lynch
So lock me in correctional, but you can't fix me or fucking see me
You know who you fucking with? A nigga who got shit to lose
I got niggas that rob you and rape yo bitch if they in the mood
Check my record, I been a fool, semi autos all in my locker
Flow stupid like I rode the bus to school with Waka Flocka
187 ways to die, bitch, this the end
6 niggas put 600 holes in yo 600 Benz
Bitch, I'm murder proof, I'mma live forever
Duncan block, Virginia street, bitch, we the clique together
Ask Pill who the real, bet he mention (Gibbs)
Killers in that 4th Ward, shout out to my nigga Slick
Shout out to my nigga Hit, West side murder cat
Some of my niggas flow, but most of them beat that murder rep

[Hook]
Cuz I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I speak a foreign language, I think y'all call that the truth
Cuz I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth
I speak a foreign language, I think y'all call that the truth
It's Gibbs, bitch[Intro/Hook - Young Jeezy]

Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Uh oh, your boy's back
And he way too flashy, got my toys back
Nigga I just left the lot, I ain't come to play
He pull me for my dealer tag, fuck you tryin' to say
Know some niggas doing 10, blame it on the yay
Clip hold a half a hundred, blame it on the K
Still the realest nigga in it, these niggas CB4
This is "Fuck A Nigga" records, and I’m the CEO
Got them stacked long and wide like some Lego blocks
This ain't even my real home, this my Lego spot
You ever seen so much money in a duffle bag?
Soon as you open up the zipper, bitch the duffle brag

[Hook - Young Jeezy]
I don’t think they know the time
Heard the streets fucked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can’t lie, man that shit got me .38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire

[Young Jeezy – Verse 2]
I’m in that purple Lamb’, looking like some dirty Sprite
Catchin' passes with them birds, yeah that Roddy White
Where I’m from them things hot, and that talk is cheap
And ain't nobody hearin' shit, cause they trying to eat
All they can eat, buffet style
Nigga sellin' anything, buffet wild
DB9 stupid grill, yeah that overbite
Need me 9 stupid deals, this shit is overpriced
Got it vacuum sealed up, that’s to hide the scent
So much that if they pull you over, smell it through the vent
If them peoples hit the lights, I be a nervous wreck
When you don’t fear nothin' but the lights, now that’s a nervous check

[Hook - Young Jeezy]

[Verse 3 - Freddie Gibbs]
That black tee with them nice hoodies
The ski mask is my uniform
You know I heard your homies don't like them
If they the right price I might go shootin' 'em for you
Take ya heaters out and you ok
Niggas took a stand on that dope case
Got murked out chillin' at a bird house
Shoulda seen the look on that ho face
When we kicked the doors off the hinge
Niggas that don’t really go all out to win
Six feet deep when you catch a nigga 'sleep in the streets
Man I bet he won't doze off again
Niggas took a Chevy and blowed off the lid
Show a hundred pounds and balled off the bitch
A couple hundred shots will hold off the picks
'Til my homeboy Will get home off his bid
I'mma still do stickups
Two Mossberg pumps in the pickup
Everybody keep your cool cause if anybody move
The bust shots will tear your whole clique up
Niggas get rushed out the ambulance lift up, lift off
Face in his ribcage, ripped off
Niggas tax 30 badges for the 36
I'd rather rob and steal than flip soft I'mma stay on...fire[Hook: G-Wiz]
I bet this how LeBron feel
I know this how Juwan feel
Just loud, ain't no Reggie over here
'93 Bulls nigga, '96 Bulls nigga, '97 Bulls nigga, '98 Bulls nigga
Golden diamonds on my clique, bitch, we the champions

[Verse 1: G-Wiz]
Might hit the club with all my rings on
Might walk in church with all my chains on
Phil Jackson, I'm on my Zen
John Paxson, I'm going in
I might go with a gold roll? and a ball fake
I feel like Pippen on a fast break
These bitches hate the way I fade away
I'll quench your thirst with some Gatorade
I'm on the west drop-top with a parkay?
But her bitch six tre on some dope veins
In the streets I stick and move like Cassius Clay
Momma called him Clay, I called him Clay
Free throws with the eyes closed
I weigh my dope up with my eyes closed
Picture me and Gangsta Gibbs in them Diablos
Midwest reppin' up to Nap-town? to Chicago

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I bet this how LeBron feel
Hit it quick then dip, now how your broad feel
Straight G.I. dough-boy my Forgi's is big as cartwheels
Worried, broke down and shamed, disgusted that's how your mom feel
My OGs sit back like Juwan
Frederico Soprano baby, your son a don
Nigga fuck the world, I'm a god, I crush this shit in my palm
FNH with murder cases, little nigga don't cross the line
'98 Bulls nigga
Test me, better have that tool with ya
So don't be nobody's fool nigga
Play niggas off like Bryon Russell, give hoes the flu nigga

[Hook][Verse 1]
4681 Broadway Road
Taught me everything I know
Laid the foundation
Gave me everything but my flow
Let me post up in the studio and learn the ropes
My daily escape from part-time-jobbin' and servin' dope
I even copped my first pound of Cali from his nephew, Jake
Tried to re-up but he got jumped on coming back from the bay
Ho, I was dro slangin'
Thirty deep at the local rap show, it was no tamin'
Freddie G was next up to bat though, name started ringin'
Even niggas that claimed the clique I claimed started hatin'
Ho nigga, you know you ain't real
Tears tatted on your face, but nigga, you know you ain't killed
Grown-ass wannabe gangsta, went to school in Merrillville (bitch)
Nigga's looking real suspicious to us
This one of them lames that's gon' stay local
Cause they lyrics was never vicious enough
A lot of them niggas I came in the game with
Can choke it down, the same dick -
They hoes (ho-ass niggas)
That's just the way shit goes

[Refrain]
I've seen all kind of trouble
I wait for that almighty dollar
That's how shit goes
Ah, I gets blowed
I gotta keep the thang close to my waistline
You never know who might try to take mine
That's how shit goes
Ah, I gets blowed

[Verse 2]
Damn, I used to feed these niggas
Gave all type of hoes, drank, and weed for these niggas
Taking it out of love, I didn't owe a thing to these niggas
I'm ready to do some evil deeds to these niggas
Proceed to squeeze triggers
It'll get strapped out or scrapped out
My dirt been documented
This just some shit that you rap 'bout
Some pussy niggas out here claiming they can see Fred
Just wanna be Fred
Don't end up buried up under these streets
Trying to get those street creds
So check it boy
I remember you used to get your ass beat by them ? boys
Nigga, let's get straight to the facts
There ain't a nigga in the G
That can say that he's as flame as me
I'm out here hitting the real licks
He was robbing a KFC
Ho, it's atrocious
Lost your focus
So you focused on my cheddar
Your brother, he was my dawg, we would always smoke together
It seemed like niggas rolled together
When we was out here broke together
But now they hoes (ho-ass niggas)
That's just the way shit goes

[Refrain]

[Interlude x4]
Sixteen shots, with one up in the hole
That's the way thugs roll

[Refrain][Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter go bang
Niggas hustle, niggas murder for this dope and cocaine
If I'm out here doing bad, I'm knocking down your door, mane
Shit, our scene might leave you terrified
That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside
Got partners locked up up-state, some partners on fed time
Shoot first and ask questions later, boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my my 9-millimeter go bang
How I take a nigga's life like it's all right, it's so strange
Put your family in the trunk, man, it's a very cold game
Shit, our scene might leave you terrified
That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside
Got partners locked up up-state, some partners on fed time
Shoot first and ask questions later, boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter go bang

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter split your brain
Bullets hit you and whistle past you
Bitch niggas and the police harass you
If you came up quick with a flip, hit a motherfucking lick, how long will it last you?
Lord, rinse my soul clean
I start my day off with Ocean Spray and promethazine
Used to roll them stogies, get blowed, and sprinkle shit in my green
Straight thugged out, dubbed out, had yo mama ride in that limousine, that limousine
Nigga fuck all my enemies, bitch I'll see y'all in hell
Better put five bullets in my dome, punk bitch, I bail, all is well
Unzip that package, it's that Cali, we can tell by the smell
Got black ski masks, rob for practice, sell that shit by the barrel
That silence'll make a whisper my sweet 9-millimeter
And I know these police is listening, gotta throw away my Nokia
If you need me then chirp, money, macking, and murder
Black mask, black gloves, black shirt in the day light, bitch I'm out here working

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: G.I. Fleezy]
My nigga, we killas, we ready for everything, trained for it all
Play your position, object and identify, when your time is called
No wonder we only gon' do it the G way and kill 'em all
Cause I don't know no other way, and them bitches know my face
So I can't wait, let me get a taste, and I hate
When niggas be actin like hoes, and bitches be actin the ???
And I don't give a fuck, have to open you up, two to the head and one to the gut
When I'm with my niggas we thinking 'bout crimes, dropping dope out on these lines
Send 'em back up to get the next one, if I got a gun, somebody gon' cry

[Verse 4: G-Wiz]
Yelling bloody murder, froze, eyes closed fo we hit the street
Could it be? Motherfucker tryna play me shyfe off some jealousy
Rapid fire hellishly, meet up with your maker
Know that karma might catch up to me, for what I did to get this paper
Lord forgive me I'm red rum sipping, grim reaper
Drug smoking, magazine loading, straight slamming and scheming
Block boy, with a short barrel that'll leave a nigga leaking
Eyes on the muddy sparrow 'til we eating, it's the season to let it rain

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs][Intro]
And you're gonna find there's nothing in the world I wouldn't do for you...just ask baby
And you know I'll come through baby

[Verse 1: Trae]
I'm from the bottom of the gutter, makin it ain't an option
Fightin to make it out, like all a nigga know is boxin
And even if a nigga win, I told him I'd be back again
Chopper in the front seat, next to these cocaine blocks again
I'll never let it go, bitch I'm the king of the streets
Caught up in ghetto dreams, like I'm in permanent sleep
Swangers of the beat to (?) old school fresh outta class
Plus my driver kinda high
He fired, he fucked up on this glass
Don't mind my temper, I'm an asshole they ain't told ya?
I'll beat the brakes up off ya like it's nothin, they ain't showed ya?
Bitch I'm the hood, you can tell by these corners I sell
If I was raided you can tell em I'm done with exhale
Under this blow I'm trying to get em to work on this scale
My brother caught a case, I'm still trying to work on his bail
I know it's real, but you can tell him I'll never leave
And everything I grip will stay the same, if I ever bleed

[Hook]
You already know they
It's the dope super bowl and nigga I'm out to win it

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I done not wanted, not welcomed, in my own home
Don't talk to my girl, so deadly I blow a whole zone
Seem like everyday I rob, steal, cheat
They said one day I might get sent up by some brawls in the street
Cause what goes around comes around, and I've been dishing plenty out
Always kept it cruising through my city with my semis out
Never let you jack me, rather let a jury hear me out
Give me life, my niggas hit the court house and clear it out
Damn man, why we sell dope, and front for these bitches, and gang bang?
In our D, and everywhere is the same thing
Nigga feel ignored, feel oppressed
Down to strike a nigga out to get some stripes up on his chest
So we rob in the vest, and the same shit that's killin us
We got Obama, but capital hills still ain't feelin us
Make laws to get rid of us, wipe us off the map
If they take me out, you can bet your life that I be strapped
I'm so cold with it...

[Hook][Verse: 1]
Woke up this morning in a bed that didn't belong to me
Gotta get on my feet and hit the streets the hood callin me
The time I waste is costin me, so I hop off in that bucket
Balling on a budget peel the top off my cutlas
Lemmie get up in the whip, turn up my shit cruise
And im not gonna stop till im one of those dudes makin major moves
Until that day I gets my pay anyway necessary
All I got is my dreams, ain't no other options up in Gary
I still love it, ain't no other place like it until I'm finished I'mma represent it
Much love to the niggas in the G that get that paper keep it pimpin
Independant women thats holdin down their household
My ghetto soldiers that struggle to bear their heavy load
I do this shit for yall, all my people dead and gone
And my dogs doin sentences behind the wall
I'm just a rebel with a cause livin' up to no good
Often misunderstood another day in my hood

[Hook]
Some things'll never change, but it's okay cause I'm good I'm tippin grippin wood
Another day in my hood, I'm from the ghetto mane
Wouldn't change it if I could, often misunderstood, just another day in my hood
[X2]

[Verse 2]
We flip our doors up the whole hood stop and stare
Ghetto superstars with their cars ridin in the L
Roll the window down you see I got the screens flippin too
We dont deck and I got my crew, gotta make it to the neighbhor hood barbeque
And, flirt with some bitches and I burn up a swisher
When the ghettos out to get ya we kick it while sippin liquor
The violence and the stress it get to work in your nerves'
I flip that bottle pop the top and pour some yac on the curb
Yeah, some things'll never change just charge us to the game
Niggas in the hood don't hear the same, they straight blow out ya brain
I grew up on Virginia street, 1631 right up off of 17th
If you see me I'm with my heat, yall better recognize and respect that
Go into the park, I'mma rep that
West side to east side if its G.I then thats where I rest at
So you might catch the kid puffin that goods
Spendin cheddar on leather grippin' woods
Another day in my hood

[Hook x2][Hook: Tony Williams]
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
They ain't never been up in your shoes
There'll never be another you
It don't really matter what you do
There'll never be another you
Baby you ain't got nothing to prove
There'll never be another you

[Verse 1: King Chip]
Thanks for having me Tony, you know
She got money from her last two exes
No kids, new Jag, new Lexus
And cook a bad ass breakfast
Just incredible, how the sex is
So I leave her but then I come right back
She be catchin' attitude and I don't like that
Wanna talk that shit, I'mma strike back
Only for the makeup sex and the night cap
They got a bed on the beach and
My thing got beef with your coochie
Got money, still sneak in the movie
Love the adventure and when you do me
I heard last man, soft ass friend like macho man
Lil' tight ass shirt on, let's just call him not your man
I'm just saying

[Hook: Tony Williams]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
F.G., all these, freak bitches wanna sex me
But due to the fact I'm a mac with a mothafuckin' sack
Man a bitch can't stress me
I'm with Alicia, Lauren, and Leslie
Miami rooftop Cabana
Heard they fucked my crew from Atlanta
Now I'm tryna hit it so pardon my manners
I was born with it so pardon this pimpin'
Can't learn nothin' talkin', bitch listen
Need a thick rare thing up in my bed frame
You look like you fit that description
Get up in the GT and get missin'
Push button start, the keyless ignition
Whole damn thing, it cost me 240
'Fore I left the lot I slapped it on Forgi’s, uh
And it don't really matter what you do
Cause I don't know another chick like you
From the back to the front to the side
Ain't another nigga doin' it like I do
Smoked out, I'm toasted
Fucked the bitch and made her lose focus
Off another dose of this dope dick
Tell all your friends, girl, promote this it's Gibbs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: King Chip]
You know a nigga need that one thing
She want a nigga that's stunting
Every time she pitch, I grand slam
Say her man be bunting
Well tonight, we going hunting
She like women like I do
Damn, well tonight we can try two
Damn, where the fuck a nigga find you?
You know a nigga mentally fucked up
Prolly on the bud, walk up in the club, get all the love
All because a nigga fucks with Cud
And even Kanye sees me, he says what's up
Tony I think I found the one
But she can't talk, her man is home
I told her save my name as Shaft Long in her damn phone

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tony Williams]
Here’s another day in the life of a champion, knight
Do I do some fight, I’m ashamed but I might
Whether wrong, wheather right
Its a dangerous sight
Are we going in

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I’m feeling like Stevie right now, you know…
I had the strangest feeling lately
The nigga's so fake I'm off it
And every time they flake like frosted
I just make my profit
And get a girl who barely bra fit
Aw shit! He back on his feet like carpet
He was just playing possum
Playing like I wasn't awesome?
Yeah I got some jokes, don't I?
Ha ha ha, laugh it up
And they'll be wack
And we'll be the last ones cracking up
Matter fact, because you nigga wanna doubt me?
Let's see how it feel without me
Taking off on this rocket, Yao Ming

[Hook][Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I was gone before he hit the ground
Saw his body shiver and get spinned around
He might be out for the count, them hollow tips pinned him downNow I ain't slept in two weeks, I'm up like I'm tweaking
Serving geekers, man it's hard to get paper up when you beefing
Niggas know my face
Niggas know my name, where I stay at
Is they gonna bitch up or is they gonna be patient and get they payback?
Fuck a sitting duck, we just gonna clip up and go where they stay at
Add the pressure til them hoes get the message, I'm gon' relay that
I got five thousand, a couple ounces and plenty burners, bruh
TV and a microwave for my dro, fuck the furniture
And my homie sister a geeker, should I be serving her?
It's like we feed each other's addictions
I'm out here earning a living off of killing my own
Flipping, pitching them stones
Niggas gonna listen cause I'm living this shit in my songs
If I should die before I wake
Just know some busters ran up in my spot and shot me in my face
Cause I'm a motherfucking gangster

[Hook: Adrian]
And I move through the day, carry on through the night
What I do to get paid? Anything to get by
And I move through the day, carry on through the night
What I do to get paid? Anything to survive

[Verse 2: Freeway]
Young, black, violent, Islamic, that's how they painted me
Forgot seasoned and polished, plenty knowledge from scholars
Globe trotter, I be in the ZaZa in Dallas
Doing my daily routine with a queen from Hollis
Know that I came from the bottom here, for the challenge
Not trying to cause mileage, try to maintain the balance
But it's kinda hard when
Niggas that swore to be made men just can't maintain they silence
Central minds under storm, make it rain violent
Sodom and Gomorrah style, hurricane island
Hit em with the 4-5, if it get homicide, matter fact suicide
Wonder if his crew will ride?
Who am I?
It's the one and only bitter Wyatt Earp, acquire work, I do oblige
Get the work to you asap, through the dodge
These other niggas telling fairytales, but we them guys
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sly Polaroid]
High rollers send the yola down to Minnesota
Money is the motive, niggas know I go scrotum
Getting cabbage is a habit
If we establish any suckas ain't cut from my fabric
You can clearly see I'm messing with another stylist
We the best and we ain't never met DJ Khaled
Certified head bussa, so above your average
They comin from Texas, I'm balling like a Dallas Maverick
If you ever middleman me cause I'm shopping through ya
Money on your head is how I send ya profits to ya
If ya snitching, then I gotta send them choppas to ya
Fuck a witness, hit the shooters on the prosecutor
I'm talking digits, seven large on my debit card
Never been a thief, pussies fuck with credit fraud
My heart's colder than a popsicle
Give you more shots than a hospital
Cause I'm a motherfucking gangsta

[Hook][Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
One day somebody told me life is like a traffic jam
Just in approaching my exit will I be back again
My homies tell me, "Keep reppin' for us"; you got it fam'
"If you can’t put the G on the map then nobody can"
Kush crumbs on plush seats, like 4 deep in a Delta '88, straight bucket with no beat
But we ride it like a Bentley
I’m bending corners and blowin' doja until the bag empty
Can you feel me?

[Hook: Cults]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself playing the diamond in the rough
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cause next time you're praying you'll be praying for me
I'm gonna run, run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
(Weed cigarillos, please don't bury me without those)
Run run away, run run away, run away show em which color is black
(Been wrong to get my paper right)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
I was the bad seed of my household
Servin' these cluckers, baby brother better keep his mouth closed
Mama complaining bout the indo, I blow it out, though
Weed cigarillos please don't bury me without those
Got some bad habits, sex and cash addict
And when it came to doin' bad I wasn't bad at it
My friend's sister, cousin trying to see which ass fattest
Take their breath like Toni Braxton, all my bitches asthmatic
Keep these hoes hyperventilating when I be penetrating
I'm in Philippe's finishing a filet, is you finished hating?
Cause if you ain't I’ll add some dirty deeds to my demonstration
My dirty...D'Eagle DL?...I only blow it on two occasions, that's day and night
Candy corona, I'm zonin' under Vegas lights
Can’t be your man, I just wanna hit it and take a hike
I'm just a lover, she take it off if I take a flight
Love a ghetto boy that do wrong to get his paper right

[Hook: Cults]
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself playing the diamond above
But honestly I've never had much sympathy
Cause the bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away, run run away, run away
Run away and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away show 'em which color is black[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
You fine as hell, you know you are
You shine just like a shining star
On a nighttime, on a daytime
In the city you go to, they say you fine
You know you are, you cold as ice
If you broke my heart, you only got twice
Cause just like you i'm a cold nigga
I only fuck with centerfolds nigga

[Bridge: BJ the Chicago Kid & Freddie Gibbs]
You know you are
You know you are (x3)

When you see me pull up in a rover
Then you know it's time for you to bend over

This for my bad bitch, bad bitch
Super bad, perfect ass, got you on baby get your cash
Bad bitch, my bad bitch
Super bad, perfect ass, got you on baby get your cash

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Girl I ain't tripping if you give it on the first night
Cause really I was down to fucking you at first sight
I see your head, nails, shoes and your purse, right
So get upon this dick and ride it like a dirtbike
Frontseat, the backseat we zoom-zoom
Hit it while we [?] and vroom-vroom
Twisting up a doobie, inhale the kush fumes
Head game stupid, ya pussy a damn fool
So I ran upon  that ass another day
I got a condo out in Cali you can go and stay
I was leaving other bitches like a throw-away
I'm try'na keep you on my team, let you know the play
Baby you fine as hell (You know you are)
That's cold in them draws, when they closed her up
My homie told me that I shouldn't let it go too far
The last nigga that you was with, you probably broke his heart, cause you

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro: x7]
(Cause that nigga ain't me)That nigga ain't me[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Fuck you bitch ass nigga

Didn't like you from the jump
You jump on dick ass nigga

Got a thick money grip and a thick booty bitch
I'mma twist a thick ass Swisher
And just get comatose
On that California dope
One night wasn't enough so yo bitch came back for another dose
Onions in my overcoat
Slamming and it's evident
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President
The motherfucking President, President
Bitch I'm out for presidents
Monica me down like I'm the motherfucking President
The President, President, bitch I'm out for presidents
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
You bitch ass nigga

Hope you mob with your squad, I done robbed some rich ass niggas
These niggas fake and it's stunting

Bitch we made in that mid
Str8 Slammin Click, niggas run it
We booked this ho for a show, gave him the cash in advance
He saw GI 100 deep, was scared to hop out his van
Said Gangsta Gibbs, we cool with you, but yo, what's up with your fam?
Once this ho nigga hit the stage, I bet he pissed in his pants
We leave you comatose, pull that bulldog .44
Straight to his mouth, nigga said what he about
But deep down he really don't want it doe
Cause bitch I set the precedent, murk you with no evidence
GI to the Chi, bitch I'm the motherfucking President

Treat me like the President

Bitch I'm like the President
Monica me down like I'm the motherfucking President
The President, President
Bitch I'm out for presidents
When I'm in your town, Michelle me down like I'm the President[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
So I just twist up a sweet
Brain tissue stay gettin burned
As I cruise up 94, did a robbery night before
He thought I was there to purchase 10, but I robbed him for 90 more
Now I'm 100 solid, bout to set up shop in Wisconsin
Grabbed my phone and chirped my plug in Milwaukee, he just responded
Homie told me sex, money and drugs, they rule the earth
So get your own, you know them thangs good as gone when they touch the turf
Destined to pay for my dirt, the resist of temptation was hard
So be a thug from your birth til you face to face with your god
And when I'm faced with that moment, I check out chiefin on straight kill
Baptized in a lake of fire, so this how hell feel
And I ain't never snitched or took the stand, bitch I'm a gangsta

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
Heard his family wept, with my weaponery blew the wall off
Know some Belizian boys that'll bury you with your balls off
Castrated
Niggas in yo click cut yo throat just cuz you candy painted
Made a little change and they forgot that you barely made it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket of crabs
I couldn't put food in my budget, I was bustin my ass
To make a choice to either eat or have money for gas
Enough to make you break morals for the love of this cash
The devil work and he stay immersed in my idle time
When there ain't shit twerkin, niggas get murked in this life of mine
And I took some hits on some niggas, never knew what they did
Never considered they momma, they family or they kid
Loaded up my sig, got a pint of gin and I took a swig
Bout to go knock his ass off the map cuz I'm on my dick

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Heard he utter words of my murder, but it was all talk
The killers I know don't get caught, but I bet they all walk
I'm a made nigga, bitch Ima make it at all costs
If you niggas seen what I saw, you'd roll with a sawed off
Few of these niggas be testin me, but they resume all false
This thuggin gon' be the death of me, lord we all lost

[Outro: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me what would you do?
What would you do if you were in my shoes?
Can you tell me?
Tell me what would you do if you were in my shoes?[Hook]
East side niggas stay bout it
West side niggas stay bout it
North side niggas stay bout it
South side niggas stay bout it bout it

[Verse 1]
G.I. niggas stay bout it
Take a nigga life don’t doubt it
Church and the liquor store crowded
911 is a joke don’t dial it
We ain't really tripping when the money stay piling
Money comin slow then mothafuckas get violent
I just want a crib and a coupe low mileage
Blowing on some dope with a yellow bone stallion
So high, and niggas wanna know why I ride
With semi automatic by my side
Cause I got niggas comin at my head
But I won’t let them bitches stop my bread
A mothafucka wanna short my dough
I hit him twice with the black fo-fo
The witness, courtroom no-show
And what a nigga don’t know, won’t go
‘Dro, hoes and the dope game made me
On the front page magazine, no label
Industry don’t want him cause the nigga’s too gangsta
Probably never heard him on ya radio station
Way too thug for these mothafuckin’ rappers
Rap way better than ya neighborhood trapper
Man came down on the uppity bitch
I be fuckin' the bitch, let my niggas smash right after
Dope in the kitchen gotta get it stretchin' n whippin'
Know some niggas that slippin, we can hit a lick if you with it
Then I ship and deliver, I ain’t took a trip in a minute
Now i’m in the position, I can give it to my lieutenant
Need a mothafucka robbed, I’m the nigga for the job
Peace to the Slammin' and the 5-Trey Mob
What you know about that life in the mask
Them Gary, Indiana niggas gift wrap ya casket, how ya love that?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Yea, I ain’t got time for these bitches
Ain’t gotta dime for these bitches
Breakin' it down for 3 bitches
Duffle stuffed with 3 6’s
Heat under the pillow, I sleep wit' my Mrs
And I’m havin' dreams that’s bigger than 6 digits
Niggas where I rest possessed to whip chickens
Livin' on ya dick til ya hit the next shipment
So high, and niggas wanna know why I, ride
With semi automatic by my, side
I need a nigga that’s fosho gon' bust
And really I’m the only nigga I, trust
And really I'm the only nigga that, cold
New shoes, Cadillac on vogues
Shine for the dimes and the rat, hoes
Check a pack, write a rap, crack, sold
And my trunk leave cracks in the pavement
Chevy only carry heavy weight, Lord save 'em
Just another victim of the game, can you blame ‘em
And he stay paid, can’t a lame nigga fade 'em
And most of you niggas in the rap game dick blowers
But at the end of the day they don't get shit for it
But me and mine’s gotta eat, so I’m beatin’ up the street
Dinner time, man, I gotta hit a lick for it
Send ‘em to God, tryna rob the godfather
And if you scared of catchin’ a murder then why bother
I’m peelin' off a knock for pots of hot water
Niggas wrote me off and it made me grind harder
Peace to the East, nigga peace to the chief
Got a slug for the judge, bringin' heat for police
And a book full of sins that I reap when I sleep
Then I wake up and I put em on a beat, how you love that?

[Hook][Boldy James]
Turn me up
Yeah, let me hit that dope after you man
Gangsta Gibbs, Boldy Blocks
Let's get it

(Verse)
I’m on the first thing smokin', smokin' on some dope
That I got from out in Oakland from my nigga Slow Motion
With the Mac Miller's, me and my fam the most dopest
Crackin' my drugs, back against the wall, overdosin'
Michael Jack thriller, Eminem to Billy Ocean
And you know (?) when the going gets tough, the tough gets goin'
All of a sudden, half these niggas candy canin'
And sugarcoating the money they're makin' in the hood for roles
Caught up in the moment, never even touched a ho
Got 'em on the mild drugs longer then you fuckin notice
I know some youngins quick to up it that's ready to blow
And we don’t play no homegirls, real homephobic
It’s concreatures but you already know the slogan
Abbreviate, my appreciation is a token
Laughing all the way to the bank, no lackin' or loafin'
Keep a couple addicts to get a new packet of dope in
Taxin 'em 4 bands, slap 'em with no hands
Hand to hand, handin' samples out – that’s free promotion
Jealousy is a weak emotion, picture me rollin'
Speedboat, by the beach, ocean, at the Boat Races

[Freddie Gibbs]

(Verse)
Gangsta G.I., 87 kush smoke
Ship it off and get my pocket used to bust it open
Hennessey and Coca-Cola keep a nigga locin'
Slow it up promethazine and Fanta, gold potion
Pull shit, drug dealer and abuser
I used to get up and crumble the oxycontin and get zooted
Sprinkle it in my weed ‘cause I was way too scared to use it
In a movie like a young don, serving heron, shootin
Takin' nails out my sock, then in a nigga's pocket
Shit is heatin for you bastards
I’m 4 in the morning Glockin'
And leave my nigga cop the Cola, the soda and yola lockin up
Today I slip my feet in new sneakers like Mr. Rogers biiitch
Hold me down, the poster child for pyrex visual
My kitchen now you know the stanky shit be in the air
You buy the first, I front the second, call me in a pair
I said I’m steppin' on a crack, I break these birds off like Kevin Ware

Bitch, uh yea
I said I’m steppin' on a crack, I break these birds off like Kevin Wear bitch[Produced by Madlib]

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin
Drugs got me wakin' up in cold sweats
Sometimes I'm slightly off my rocker, but I'm on deck
Got 2 and a baby off my bitches student loan check
She hit my line to get that girl, I call it phone sex
Robbing like my problems ain't gon catch up to me later
Bitch I'm mobbing like OG Bobby Johnson, split your potato
At the table, cooking, shaving and touching base with them basers
Bet they try to make a play for the yay' as soon as they taste it
The amazin' black American Gangster, sinister, corner her
Cuz seeing this nigga shine been annoying me like a muthafucka
This busta owe me, now he act like he don't know me
Forty fo' my closest homie, kill cockaroaches like Tony
Got Montana money
Newport 100 dipped in fluid, yo, I had to smoke it
Pupils dilated like silver dollars, now we loc'ing
Call it devilish how I do bitch
Fuck these niggas talking, I leave they thoughts on my shoestrings
What?


[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Rolling
Pockets all swollen
Set the record straight, that FNH is what I'm holding
A busta that we know got 15 'bows, bust it open
We came bandana'd up, divide it up, now what's the quotient?
A split with 4 niggas, since I'm a go getter
I think these suckers pussy, I'ma merk the whole litter
Told my girl to leave as soon as I hung up the phone with her
Man, I heard you rob the robbers, look Freddie a cold nigga
Got an ice maker for a heart, made nigga from the start
Life is like a movie, all I did was play my fuckin' part
Cheffing up the crack, the heroin, and the weed a la carte
I call it Fast Freddie's, I should own a fuckin' restaurant
Cuz back when I was 12 threw some bells on a scale and I got a pager
We broke them down and started selling nickels to the neighbors
Eventually the penitentiary gon' see me later
Kiss my momma, told her if I die, then it was part of nature
What?

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
28 days later we all getting fresh
Got the heart to die for something, flesh to flesh
The Lambo, got her outside, it's a stretch
My bitch half Mexican/Afghan, I'm blessed
From living tough times with rough lemons, a gorgeous watch
My team on a dreadful level, yo
Yeah, we still getting money right
Long as the sun come out, I'll hold these twenties tight
Getting fresh, just cooling, my bitch on my dick
Ba boom yo, you live with your moms, just get a grip
Clip in my pocket, my rocket
I think of the Dips, I need Juelz and Jims, with rough licks
Trips to Africa, shorty tear Saks up
I'm out in Bombay, rebels here actin' up
We real, all G, 75-hundred of us
Up in the Sprinter bus, fussin' "we need more heat"Tales of a nigga living in his momma basement
Listening to her bitchin' every morning it's the same shit
Time for me to get out on this corner make the 'caine flip
Post up at a nigga residence and we invasive
Knockin' at your door bitch, like I was maintenance, and you sprung leak
Heard you get pounds of that grape shit every other week
So my inclination to take shit at it's fucking peak
Stash and broke it down at the 7s go for a buck a piece
Cop a sweet, for a minute, swisha the optimal
Now I twist my shit in the woods, but I got that tropical
Some may say that I think illogical
Cause I still believe in God but down to dance with the devil to make a dolla' tho
I drop her, straight in the water, never bother
Serve anything other than hard, I keep it starvin'
Say she fuck with nothing other than ballers so I charmed her
We hit the mall right after I robbed her baby-father
The home wrecker, chrome leather and wood kiss
Keep my name hot in the hood and my dick in the hood bitch
Niggas violate we slice 'em and dice 'em like wood chips
Ho' we straight vanilla ice 'em and get on some shug shit
Came a nigga from 40 stories, Watch 'em drop that Wile E. Coyote
New in yo' hood but G all of them shotta niggas know me
Gangsta Gibbs from the guts never gave a fuck
Excuse me while I get my paper and my haters up
Yeah, my connect a 40, coppers get straight killed
Got the cash probably coppin' a whole field
We ain't shot the bitch, we dropped him, that's on the real
I was born to roll[Freddie Gibbs]
No doubt about it
I'm doing what I do dog

[Hook]
No doubt about it
I’m doing what I do dog
Keep more than a few broads moving with my crew dog
We bout it, bout it we came in with them tools dog
Doing what I do dog, moving with my crew dog

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Woop woop, yep yep
Snap back stay bang to the left
East side nigga bang to the death
Weak niggas we done laid them to rest
So pour out a little liquor
Got these hoes out and they vicious
Nigga tryin to bust them down
But I done fucked around and got an O of loud with no swishers
Whats up?
Roll some, smoke some, let me poke some
Man I got up in that pussy like four somethin'
When the clock struck five I was in the ride
Five thirty she was already on my line
Sayin what about breakfast, but a nigga like me too restless
Got a lot of money on my checklist
Talkin to my OG niggas in Texas he said
This game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried
He said this game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried

[Hook]
No doubt about it
I'm doing what I do dog
Keen on and a few broads moving with my crew dog
We bout it, bout it we came here with them tools dog
Doing what I do dog, moving with my crew dog

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
No doubt about it, no doubt about it
Keep hoes around me don't fuck with them hoes that doubt me
My nigga's bout it, and my bitch's bout it
And my dick too crowded got too many people on it
Now if people talking bout you then know you're doing things
They ask about my song, they like the way I screw it man
Hey, these bitches poppin, man these nigga coppin
Man I feel like every label in the world just signed me
Yeah I'm from the bottom, when we sip drink and we poppin pills
We pop the seal, got diamond grills
And I'll fuck your girl while I'm bending curves
One think about it, say one think about it
I'm always about it only touch it for a profit yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Woop woop, yep yep
This for my niggas on them project steps
This for my niggas on the project stoop
Grind till you got a coupe no roof
Grind till you put your moms in a new spot
On the block with the bomb it was too hot
On the block with the bomb it was so cold
Sellin dope in the snow til my toes froze
Deliver 36 o's in the old's mo
One stop, nigga ran through the whole dough
One stop, nigga ran through the whole brick
Ice water wheel now that's cold shit
When it's hot keep it cold bitch
Straight put some work on that road bitch
Can't leave the street life alone mayne
Know Jeezy callin my phone mayne

This game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
Can I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried
He said this game so dirty, gotta roll around with my thirty
And I keep my clip extended for these bitches I ain't worried

[Hook][Hook]
Maybe it's that... maybe it's that... maybe it's that
Dro that I'm smokin got me rollin, slow motion
I'm blowin' dough that's so potent, got a nigga coughin and chokin
I'm in that... Boxframe cadillac, swervin off the exit ramp
Split my swisha with my thumb, rolling hydroponic plants

[Verse 1]
I got the bass bangin, window cracked
Breakin down a reefer sack
Big money grip with an ounce of that piff and a fo-fifth in my lap
I'm in that boxframe cadillac, swervin off the exit ramp
Split my swisha with my thumb nigga roll that hydroponic plant
Pint of 'gnac, mix it with the red bull, take another pull of this dodey
This endo, roll up that window
If you see me rollin in I'm smokin, guarantee, fire weed
Not a stick, not a seed, pack of blunts all I need
I'm about to get sent up I don't give no fuck man I'm all about gettin fried
I don't know how they do it where you reside
GI niggas smoke and ride
So if you with it, catch a contact
Non smokers fall back, we can chit-chat
I'd rather be in, gone in the 'llac

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Yo I've been smokin since a youngin
Coppin halfs and quarter onions
Peach optimo, fillin it with that leafy green stuffin
And my nigga ? he used to smoke one with me after practice
Fuckin batches, cuttin classes and constantly dumpin ashes
And I miss my dude, wishin I could still be with my dude
I'd give it all up to get him back I swear to god
All the money, cars and expensive jewels
Yeah I smoke that G-5 blaze
Just to ease the stress and pain
Mama think I'm strange
Maryjane put alot of evil thoughts in my brain
Alotta times man I be on that murda shit
Hit me with the spinach if you got a problem with it you can tell that to my burner bitch
Please don't make me act a fool
Tryna keep my cool
But my head, missing screws
So you know it ain't no doubt I'mma straight jab out
Like I ain't got shit to lose

[Hook][Hook x2 - Z-Ro]
Even if it's raining I'mma still drop the top
That's some other silly shit niggas do when they at the top
Homie we don't give a damn we rolling we ain't tryin' to stop
Most likely we in a foreign but dogging it like it's a Boxframe Cadillac

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
As I maintain from lane to lane
Whip wetter than a lake on fresh paint
Cutless with candy cane
Niggas run up on the kid and get stained
Mac 90 melted brain
Clique got his ass dancing with every color on everything
Police on my dick so I dip off in a different car
Stick some cutie Kansas I got workers off in Wichita
State to state life behind the mask check the murder rate
Nigga want my chain ain't got the nuts to catch a murder case
Nigga's fake, I got some bodies under this Gucci buckle
Them G.I. mafia your family nigga reach out and touch you
All the way from the East Side to Ivanhoe now all my niggas made
We ain't sweat no drama so catch these hollows or catch the fade
Rolling solo-dolo narcotics, coppers, and bread
Homie so goin' off this dope that I pass the blunt to my dead homie
They call me Freddie forgiato fuck that vodka
Cop that henny in a minute we bust the bottle

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Today I feel like rolling through the city
So I guess that's what I'm gonna do
Bitch you wanna ride, you gotta be a 20
You betta' if you a 10 then I don't want you
And I want everybody to see me so I ride so slow
Damn right that's what Ro gon' do
44 magnum pack a jacker put a cereal bullet hole on you
I'm knock knock knocking on the truck like Jehovah's witnesses
And I don't even know who bitch this is
But everytime she come up for air she keep sayin'
She wishin' her nigga had a dick this big
Ho you betta' swallow every last
Don't get none of that on my seats
Baby thats a phantom my bad but pussy and titties
And ass can't compete
And there's something about when I drop my top
It's like bustin' a nut
And I wish a mutherfucker run up on me with that bullshit
I'mma beat him up and I won’t spill my cup
Homie I'm running on mayonnaise and mustard
The 610 loop till the interstate
Which one that don't matter add one of them motherfuckers
Cause they can all take us to get the cake
I remember my first car Canary yellow Cutlass
With the brown door to drive by mobile
I was eating and sleeping and living in
I woulda traded a mattress for my mobile
But nowadays when oil change just a couple of stacks
Folks gave me and in the middle of falls gate highs
And in the front big falls gate in the back

[Hook x2]
