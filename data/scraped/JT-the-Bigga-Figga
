Guce nigga, back out of jail and still fiendin'

Big boss when we push off the purple and sippin' on yac
Now I made ya bitch wanna be like how you act, I'm all that
Still hurtin' from the heart, from the block party to the park
I keep it real with my niggas from the start
They never came to see me
I'm steady bustin' like I stepped on these motherfuckers love me
Better guard ya silk dog, I got my wealth
The front cover of a murder dog, we all hogs
Spot full of cock, bitch niggas get blue balls
It's sick that you should fuck with a real West Coast nigga
Fuck that scrilla, imagine that
Real run around, we'll run around
Have you ever heard of a get paid G
Hoggin' ballin' they one piece to the streets, it's dir-ty
The police thinkin' they know about me and how I did it
They mad cause everything we talk about we did it
Pull a mob trifecta, soldiers ready to wreck ya
Bitch niggas that snitch or go to jail that mafia gonna get ya
Hitters with wigs, bustin' with zigs
We subject the closer we get
My holster to chest, ya left wet

[Verse 2]
I fuck with three hundred a week
I keep thuggin' and lovin' the shit that I speak
Hungry starvin' and searchin' lurkin' workin' for pops
Young nigga have us some big fat knots
Hate to be with or without it retaliate with ya plate in my hand
Now who's the man with the master plan
I dump, spin-off and get away with the quickness
Shot off ya mama's house, stole ya dope, fucked ya bitches
Ain't no thing to a boss
To be a boss a playa costs
To take from ya wrist and take a loss
I take and toss you toss it back
You don't wanna catch a heart attack
Bust, huss and get em' back, nigga

[Hook x2]
I thought you knew what we came fo'
Give up the money and the dough before ya brains blow
That's how it is, ain't no love in this biz
I did it all for a reason if so it would've never been did

[Verse 3]
Yeah we ghetto platinum so back up nigga we hot scorchin'
I'm in this game for strictly the fame and the fortune
We full force up in the rap industry so take caution

With Guce Corleone so man I'm claimin' GOP
And ain't gon' ever stop my nigga we invest in this shit
Lyricals techs that get you wet when I spit it
Y'all nigga done did it y'all fuckin' with made niggas
We block mobsters and unstoppable we can't be beat
Y'all wanna see us nigga meet us on the street
At any time or place in beef you can't sleep
I'm the number one contender makin' y'all meet defeat[Verse 1-Daz]
See I'm in it just for wit it
And I'm in it for the long run
Hang out the window lil' lower just for fun
I catch it all of ratch get feeled get called up
The shit I spit how shit get caught up
Get rid crow bar before a person 14-5
The shit niggas gotta do try 2 get high
As time fly by so quick so fast
The dollars is big cash as I stacks my dash
I burn some hush wit some indo hang my rain out the window
Bullets flying just like missiles we the dawg
We mob type shit when we guiling we blast
As the job and then we dump him and slide him

Chorus: Daz

Hoes,in drop top benz, having major ends (x2)

Chorus (x2)

[Verse 3-JT Da Bigga Figga]

And plus I rolls wit the squad drinkin' mob mend(mob mend)
And plus a thug niggas thugged out niggas ready to play hard

Hoes,in drop top benz, having major ends)

Chorus (x2)

Fade to EndHustlas, ballers, players
Yeah, uh
The father figure
It don't stop, it don't stop
Uh, it don't stop
One love, one love

[J.T. The Bigga Figga]
I was raised in the inner city by ballers with diamonds
Climbin the Benzes, rollin Philles, we younger minors
Me, I be the one that's only 12 years old
Crankin off the hook from cousin, let me sport his gold
And I was told to put it down, and keep it real
Like 3X Krazy young player about the scrill
In this California lifestyle that I live
Them playas is havin money man in plushed out cribs
Survivin in the city is a serious task
Didn't know the (?) wanted, didn't have time to ask
Cuz I'm Bout It Bout It like the TRU
One love to real hustlers, straight dollars for two

[Hook:]
Gangstas, ballers, and hustlers too
Baby youngsters wanna be like you
You're the father figure of today
We need to find a better way

[J.T. The Bigga Figga]
We at the afterparty chillin cuz we ain't no punks
Some cats is in the back with macks and gold fronts
With sacks they post up, you know we be watchin
Thinkin they got it crankin, playa we got it poppin
Now bitin over dirty work, that ain't cool
With cats in drop 'Vettes in mobs and old schools
We rob them old fools, won't you amount your scratch
Respect them young G's, they the ones that's strapped, ya know

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Dogg Pound, that's the sound, check around, we hold it down
It's the super duper, yes the Snoop-a
Comin through, in all gray and blue
Kickin the game to the playas from the bay
All over the world and out the UK
Everybody around they love Snoop D-O double to the G
Cuz I'm what they love, you see
I'll break em, shake em and I make em and I take em
To the whale, leave em in a spell
And I got a little story to tell
For all my homies that's locked up in jail
I kick it to ya give it to ya for real
Cuz I know y'all dealin with the reals every day and
To get killed ain't nothin to laugh about
But some niggas goin out so sideways make me wanna get me a
Bulletproof
Hoo ride and slide around town in
But yet and still, if I get peeled
My niggas gon ride forver and that's real
Ain't no stoppin we ain't coppin no pleas
We spit game for all the real G's
Feel up the (?) they love to have it
They love to take it to the dome, yeah it's on

[J.T. The Bigga Figga]
Meanwhile back in the lab
Paper was gettin stacked, hatas was gettin mad
Confidential information exchanged up on the regular
One dead head, two steps a my competitor
Catch em slippin cuz they just been bought
Got directions to the house and the keys to the vault
Well let me open up this bundle of money, each off a half
Pullin capers with cousin Snoop, Kurrupt and young Daz
In for the cash
Man this gang is thick
If one caught up in the track we can all get sick
And have em shook
The four O crook didn't leave a clue
Snoop D-O double G tell em what you gon do

[Snoop Doggy Dogg] (Both)
I'll keep doin what I'm gon do
With my (nigga J.T.) the Bigga Figga, that's my nigga
Representin (Frisco, in case you didn't know)
(We blow by like Jerry Rice
Come back with styles that are oh so nice)
Snoop D-O double to the G from the LBC
You gots to have (cash) to make it these days
You could make it at least a hundred different (ways)
I go the man and I get a (8 track)
Make me a beat, (smoke me a sack)
Roll up some fat ass uh uh uh
Blaze with my homies and it's (on like that y'all)

[Hook] X 3Thinking about the things that I used to do
Back in the days fuckin around with the crew
87, 88, 89
Stealing cars snatching purses sometimes a grind
I found a way to get mine
When shit got thick best believe I bought a nine
I carried my bitch everywhere I went
Tryin to get rich cause time was spent
Making those money moves making those money moves
Making those money moves a nigga can't lose
I wanted to come sick
A drop-top Firebird with a 92' kit
Candy paint with the gold trim
Leather interior with the rims
It was hard to stop
Bitches on my jock but money over cock
But it didn't work that way
Got trapped by the system a nigga had to pay
And go do a little time
Had a lot on my mind so I started to rhyme
Now it's 92' back on the scene again
But this time strapped with a pad and pen
Came to spit this gift I got
Poppin that shit cause it's got to be popped
All you sucka MCs must learn
Hooked up with my boy named Herm
Got rushed to the studio
Three months later getting seen on the video
Then you talkin bout JT, when's your next show
Can I go, can I go?
I don't think so bro
Cause you tried to play me
So take it for what it's worth
Puffn on dank while I'm dippin through the turf
Mackin on your ho
Yeah I got game cause she paid for the indo
Call me a gaffler call me a sucka
The nigga JT ain't nothin but a hustla

Ain't nothin but a hustla (2X)
Fool, ain't nothin but a hustla
An A-1 hustla

Can I get a fade cause I'm passin more licks
Back to back eleven seven straight hits
Pass the blunt and brew yeah I thought you knew
That I'd tear the fold before I come anew
I guess he had a feeling and he knew
I was gonna break him
Cause now he's getting paid telling me how to shake em
And get em off the wall
I'd be a damn fool to listen and let you call
Cause I'm a do my thang
Get the money and the watch
And the mothafuckin gold chain
Cause I'm a play for keeps
If a nigga try to play me I'm a put his ass to sleep
Nighty night fool
JT the Bigga Figga coming from the new school
When I say the new school you know I mean playas
Gangstas, hustlas, straight rhyme sayers
Young niggas about 18
Coming up hard stackin green
Mackin on hoes gettin new clothes
Goin to the store buying Daytons and Vogues
Fresh out the box
All that shit without slangin them rocks
Yeah nigga nothing but a hustla
You just a busta your crew is straight suckas
I got niggas that's ready to roll
The Young Black Gangstas and the Outta Control
You can't peel me man do you feel me?
Your girl, she wanna steal me
And take me to a room and get it on
But when she go to sleep that's when I'm gone
Going through her purse like a roadrunner
And get your cash
Cause you ain't nothin but a play-a-ho
Now you wanna fight better yet a Captain Save a Ho
So put on your cape and find your gloves
Cause a playa like me is showin no love
You can get mad you punk little busta
The Bigga Figga boy ain't nothin but a hustla

(chorus)

Definition of a hustla
I ain't got time to be fuckin with you suckas
Niggas getting jealous and shit
But I'm a keep coming with them hits
Tryin to get away from the grind
Cause that's gonna lead to more time
So I chose to go down the right road
It'll be better is what I was told
As a young buck coming up
Didn't have shit so I didn't give a fuck
Found my way to the street corner
Fifty percent dope, fifty percent soda
But now it's a dope beat with a dope rhyme
Cause a nine will get ya time
In C.Y.A. or the state pen
Where it's all the same cause it's straight men
With no type of hoes and no money
Fuck cell commissary cause it ain't funny
I'd rather get a royalty check
Then on the corner tryin to break my neck
For a punk ass twenty sale
Fucking with this I'm gonna triple my mail
This song here's going out to the busta
The Bigga Figga nigga ain't nothin but a hustla

(chorus)

Get my money on[Da Unda Dogg]
Whassup boy?
[Mac Dre]
What's happening playa, just sitting here, you know
Putting together some of that ghetto gumbo, you know
[Da Unda Dogg]
Some motherfucking gumbo?
[Mac Dre]
Yeah nigga, gum in the mother fuck bo
[Da Unda Dogg]
Like that there?
[Mac Dre]
Yeah, I got my niggas in here, we finna put it down
You know what I'm saying, real, real special
You know? Check it out, like this here

Verse1(Mac Dre)
As I get to bustin'
This introduction
Of mind corruption
And rhyme seduction
I steal and fill brains
With game and mo' thangs
Like them dope thangs
And what that ho brang
Creep on Crest streets
Speak on fresh beats
Hit the motel, and freak on fresh sheets
And wet sheets, is the end result
Been killing long cock since ten years old
See I blend this old-game with this new
And ain't no telling what a bitch will do
Now picture you
In my position
Steady getting sweated by the opposition
Could you handle
All this scandal
And keep on stepping like boots and sandals
My handle, is young Mac Dre
Silky slim, is my A.K.A
And you know that bay is my rompin' grounds
I mean stompin' grounds
But I like the way Rompin' sounds
So I'ma keep it
Romp related
And if it ain't down with the romp, I hate it

Verse2(JT the Bigga Figga)
Well let me jump into the pot with all the hustlers and players
Chop potatoes with Phillie faders,Knocking niggas with Tre Eights
But now I
See my niggas at the spot with the session
Illegal product
Then people plotted, rotted with no confessions
Smith and Wessons
Demonstrations with Fully Autos, actin'
Conversations at the lab to keep the trackers trackin'
Double backin' to the spot where all the money filter
Keep it on the down low
You never tell about your scrilla
On the reala
I breaks it down in all directions
It's the Fillmoe players with the O
And the Crest connection
All in the session with my folks, You know they got the Dolo
Hit the gateway tracks, like some fiends in a forward Volvo
Bought a Bolo
Seen Kelly, mashed off, and then we hollered
Trailing Coolio and Mac Dre in a green Impala
Getting cloudy
The laboratorys just like a porny
Got a patient
Cousin Quinn is making the shit get saramani
Hella fetti
We ready, steady, with all the bumbles
Keeping it real with Dangerous Dame and Mac Mall in this fucking gumbo
Straight paper
Straight fetti
Straight gumbo

Verse3(Dangerous Dame)
Niggas we pull
Niggas will say so
We hit the strip from San Jose, to Vallejo
Make more scrilla by the mouth piece
Non-talking niggas don't know shit about me
Ignore 'em like bitches
Respect
There ain't a hand out
Like a sore thumb, fake niggas always stand out
Player hater prayer
Praying that I buckle everyday
Ain't worth five cents, or my knuckles to the face
But my burners ain't feeling no flesh
If you niggas wanna test
Let it jump and we could put the shit to rest
You thinking deeply
But I be on service like a shark
Consider me that hate, but see I serve you from the heart
Cause love loves me
And hate loves me
So what the fuck you think?
You can't fuck with me
You paying dopefiends, to put 'em to work
But now your money's gettin' low
While I be getting low with this wicked flow
You got at me last night
But I wasn't asking who was bustin' the trigger
I'm blowing big bomb smoke, yelling "Nothin' ass nigga"
My pimping ain't soft
I'm taking no losses
So why the hell do you persist to put me in crosses?
You thought it was shackles, but then they was ropes
And now they're spider webs
I broke on you hoes
I know what you're doing before you do it
Got an outside plan, but in the end you're looking stupid
Huh, yeah
Cause Dangerous Dame got 'em riding on the freeway
Actions speak louder
I don't fuck with he say-she say
Think you got game?
Never could you have it
You niggas are crying wolf, while I'll be fucking Jessica Rabbit
Straight trading places
But fool this ain't no dream
You was happy as hell when you had me under your infra red beam

Once again, get low for the East O
Add a little recipe to the gumbo

Verse4(Da Unda Dogg)
Add me
Mix me up
Stir me in the pot with these niggas that fix me up
See, back in '91, Coolio was the shit
So now we cooking a batch of gumbo and it ain't gonna quit
My nigga the Bigga Figga, adding that spice so fool it's saucy
You bitches thinking you'll eat for free, well this shit is costly
So back up off me
And recognize the sound is poppin'
Beause we steadily droppin' dope, like the keys you coppin'
Mother fuckers, they get to actin foul
When they know they can't fuck with the style
Smile punk mother fucker, sucka, hating bustas
Ain't no friends when it comes to ends, so you can not trust us
But trust me
You can not dust me, or try and bust me, dumbo
Your ass gets heated in this pot of gumboUh, uh yeah uh
Just another one, just another one
Uh uh, check it

[Verse 1]
Never touch mine, breakin' ya hustle
Watchin' ya crumble over punk shit
Runnin' ya mouth, now you in trouble
Got ya whole click sittin' there hot
We at the spot
Feed the money counters into the block
And at the top is an old lady
Matchin' Mercedes, servin' her husband
Cause the homie's crazy
Bought up and drunken
Straight thuggin' and trees burn
Weed clouds get distributed
Eyes turn red palms sweat
When niggas hit the shit
The AC on, CD knockin' and it's the Gamblaz
Ghetto platinum, stuck in some shit
You know we handle em'
They still talkin' still hustlin' still musclin'
And takin' over, catchin' your queen
With no smugglin'
She told it all
Checkmate like Mac Mall
We all ball, we dogs
With no plaques on the wall
We independent on some other shit
Movin' them boxes
Cause it's cash on delivery
The safe in the closet
We still lovin' it

[Verse 2]
I wanna get riches, flip sixes, and own a condo
Blowin' Bom though cause the niggas is some smokers
In the Gamblaz shack with craps, and scraps for poker
We stock brokers, we trained just like Wall Street
I look at all my competition this war meets
The Gamblaz, we ghetto platinum and y'all weak
Though I sit back blow off Rap City all week
Seein' garbage ass rappers that think it's all sweet
It's deep, better watch the Gamblaz we on creep
The first to leap, get sweeped beneath the feet
Man I treat the world to million dollar rhymes and lines
About thugs movin' dimes and carryin' loaded nines
Fatal times and crimes keep fuckin' up my mind
I'm blind and still livin' life on the line
Read the line status, hits to hits in my defense
I don't wanna get penned to the fence and get rich
Everyboy say I'm takin' a risk to get rich
Tryin' to flip off a million dollar dissin' and shit
Splittin' sections to fractions, perhaps it's for actions
They got me bringin' pain like the tractions, what happened

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, yo
More money to get, O's to flip, hoes to break
Clockin' loot from state to state movin' major weight
Like cargo, breakin' em' off something hardcore
We all roll, to have big money is what we ball for
In and out of lanes countin' my cash
With a blunt on my lips and ounce of my stash
We bounce fast up the block, tuck the Glock then skat
Rockin' raps won't stop till my pockets fat
I'm out to profit in this game till my time is over
I spend my spare time hustlin' and grindin' doja
Fuck exposure just show me the cash up front
We mash punks and shoot lyrics like we blastin' pumps, what

[Verse 4]
Smoke, smoke, smoke till I can't smoke, smoke, smoke
I fucks a ho till she can't fuck no more
In it been gettin' it like lobster and shrimp
I don't know why I'm a hell of a pimp
I strive with a limp, flip the gift and get swifted
On my mama, I'm a fool I get with this
I don't admit, fuck all y'all ya crew's small
All the funky funky girls just ball
Flip my dick in her jaw, fuck the law
Diggy Daz the shit straight breakin' the law
Tell me, tell me, tell me who's number one
That nigga Daz, all these suckers get done

[Verse 5]
I been thugged out since day on, also pays to come
Dues been done paid, blocks been done sprayed
Ya whole click can't fade one nigga in my crew
Paper bound is what I represent cause money I pursue
I ain't takin' losses dog while niggas crossin' game
Live for money fuck fame and all my life I endure pain
I ain't no lame so don't try to play me for no jokes
Weed smoke and Hennessey got me easy to provoke
Turn to music top my folks, Vicky, Tera, Macy
I got it sowed from BK street to the A-V-E
And y'all hatin' me cause my riches steadily stackin'
I see ya whole crew standin' sold bushes out there with em'
Here we go like a phantom but I'm backboard tweezed
Me and the Fig and the Gamblaz flip to L-I-V-E
G-O-P bitchVerse 1 (Killa Tay)
We pump slugs, and punk thugs for their drugs
When push come to shove ain't no motherfuckin love
Bow down, we just hit the town
But we brung shit like Hitler, bail em with a Sigma
Switch with the first shot, gotta check the spot
Burnin rubber out the parkin lot, pointin out the window
Stuck off indo, bumpin my nigga C-Bo
Bitches all in my business cos they think I move kilo's
I, call my people's on the mobile, gang global, nationwide distribution
Now I'm posted up in Houston
Texas, ridin a Lexus but it's supremo
Niggas set trippin, so a solo weapon is essential
Keep the pepper spray on my car keys, only fuck with hard Gz
Still get my ball on like Barkley
Nothin but the California hog in me
Touchin triggers, real niggas, straight doggin freaks

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?

Verse 2 (JT the Bigga Figga)
We take the occupation when movin, my hustle never stop
Check what? Some babies camera's peep the blocks, stash the Glocks
Posi's squashed, ship ki's and here there's thousand dollar bidders
Rim hats with feathers, more money than Perry Ellis
Never known behind ???, talkin "let my nuts hang"
Trade ya the .4-5 and the Tek 9 for a drop Mustang
A long line of killers, drug dealers with stripes
Just schoolin, you're rollin pontentially, could take your advice

(C-Bo)
We count big face and straight laces by the hundreds
Ragtops and big blocks, gettin the money
Sippin X-O Hen, and I get it for the 1-10
In a convertible Benz, fearin hunted, on twins
They call me Bo-Loc, and fo' sho' I smoke the dodo
And flip the '97 Sport to shake the po-po
High rollers count, tall dollars will never fall
In this shit for the cash nigga, enter, forever ball

Chorus

Verse 3 (C-Bo)
We are surprised in this rap game
Straight gangsta shit makes the world go round, I'm nuttin nice
On a dice, bets are more wet and crush ice
X-O, stretch Rolls, Bza's and Lexo's
And fuck the best hoes, and never slippin like Magic Johnson
Keeps my top down, increase my hatto, from Sac to Compton
Rolex down, fools shot up, solid ice
The gin in the cask was still followed by the vice
In the S-Class, we does it on the gas
On my cell, Bo poppin my collar, all about my cash
How many diggers can you scat? Now picture that
Without the feds on your back, homey, and that's a fact
We attack with Mac 1-12's to protect my sack
I pick up my pack, tellin the order "handle that"
It ain't no room for you busters cos we knuckle ya downfall
Player haters, fuck y'all, let these ballers all ball

Chorus:

Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Can we all ball?
Tell me, can we ball?[Hook: The Game + JT]
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles

[JT the Bigga Figga]
They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P
Street smarts is crucial for young niggas in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga

[Hook]

[The Game]
I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggas don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT

[Hook]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name

[The Game]
I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa
Singin "Ain't No Nigga" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at
I'm ghetto

True ballaz never love 'em, fuckin aunties an cousins
Got a have a ??? humble, sticky green gumbo
Layin by the pool, hella full off gumbo
Rollin wit these g's, get R.I.P
By desert eagles to mini gages, to AR-15's
See I don't trust a soul on patrol when I roll
4-4 I hold cuz I gotta shake parole
You can stroll wit me, rock an roll wit me
But when the one times dip, cock, unload wit me
Cuz I'm a killa, nappy head nigga, from out the valley, best strapped
Down, in Sac-Town, capitol of Killa Kali
Fool I comes heated, when needed, niggas retreat
When I blast pair of parabellums an a mini 14 when I smash

(Chorus)

None of y'all niggas can't fade this
West coast niggas is the craziest
We got that MOB mentality

(Chorus)

Verse 3-(C-BO)

We puts it down like g's, swingin' vipers an vests
From Benz to Beamers an Lamborginis all on the set
An keep it crackin' from LA all the way back down to the Bay
I'm from the, valley, northern of Killa Kali, where g's lay
Gots to keep yo head up, you slip they drop, they leave you wet up
Blasted magnum taggin' the fool of the big block we hit him up
Eyes do or die, let 'em drip til they dry
Two killaz eye to eye, never duck when bullets fly
Keep it crackulatin, like Pearl Harbor when we spit
G's bump this shit, from ??? moves to the rip set
Trippin get split
Wit a magnum
Steady blastin' now I done seen murder eye to eye
But my kids hope that I'm steadily fastenin
Ain't no love for you that's down at the end of my barrel
When I multiply my cash, ridin' in my 4 barrel Camaro
I catch ya slippin', I'm slappin' my clip in, I'm puttin' it down
You been hit from slippin' an clockin' the grip in my town

(Chorus until end)[The Game]
You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5
Whatever way dog, the Game get live
Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. city velour
Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggas in Converse dog
Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin
Only difference is the whores is watchin
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the C-P-T
Run with the +Pound+ like I'm from DPG
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

[JT the Bigga Figga]
I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky
The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face, and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up
Switchin gears with the pedal and ride

[Hook]

[The Game]
I'm a shining star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze
Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so
Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them "Ocean 11" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me?  Naw truly, might lose your lives
They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I

[Hook]

Hey, hey that bitch tripping man, hey bring us some drinks ho
Man that show was liver than a motherfucker they was loving us
Man it was large as shit

Verse 1 (JT the Bigga Figga)

Check the sickness, forget this game that you missing
So I understand you had a plan to rip up potential
Players in the game without no shame to fault me
Realize that they surprised that you tried to salt me
I backed up off ya, I seen ya coming
Doing a 100 or more running, so now I'm gunning
If you try to play them players nigga than you getting played
Keeping my game tight so short like a razor blade
Afraid of who is what you ask me
Just because you got your mac10 ready to blast me
And pass me up as if you didn't know
Representing getting low, P nigga hit the floor

Verse 2 (Master P)

Sideways through the cut with the gold one's spinning
Suckers jealous cause they know the P is deep up in it
On my way to Filmore to see JT
We ain't set tripping its all about some dope beats
But you got to watch your back for them perpetrators
Imitators man I mean player haters
You know the type, that's quick to fucking give you dap
And all the while, they ready to fucking peel your cap
And if ya don't understand don't test me
Cause the P ain't living fucking nappy
I'll leave some motherfucking flowers at your gravesite
And make love to your bitch almost every night
Caught you slipping and you died like a perpetrator
On your tombstone should read player hater

(Chorus)

I ain't saying no names
Its alot of player haters ain't true to the game

Verse 3 (Master P)

Player haters in ya face wanna talk and laugh
Same fool in the hood with a ski mask
Don't move don't budge don't even flinch
Caught you slipping so they going for your dividends
I should put you on your back once they get your scraps
Cause they know a nigga like you is living fat
And as you stroll in the 4, cause life is cold
But don't trip cause that's just a bad episode
That life in the ghetto ain't no joke
At sometime you die in this game for selling dope
But if you don't sell dope, than you gotta kick it
And them same hoes, they wanna fucking kick it

Verse 4 (San Quinn)

Do you wanna ride to this or do you wanna side to this
Just a young baby boy coming with the flyest shit
Get you higher than that chronic can bring ya
Lets hit that niggas field
Coming from your shoulders, now you reaching for your steel
My ?? of real is a step away from nothing happened
Pick up the mic and get to rapping
Stepping like the?? making all these hoes something vicious
Not even these playa haters can identify my sickness
You taking winners to ?? while I caught myself
Hit the cuts and came up with legitimate wealth
From the ?? hardest city by the Bay
Busting rhymes, dropping nines dropping simply for a payday
Had his rest to make way
Before I break him down with the og russian cickle
When the shit don't tickle
My show won't pickle and I ain't no buster
You player hating niggas better stay away from a real hustler

And its like that for the 94 nigga

(Repeat 3x)

And its like that and its like that
And you player hating niggas don't like thatIntro (Mac Dre & Miami the Most)

[The Game]
Who really the best rapper since 'Pac got killed
I done answered that question when I copped my deal
Ask yourself when the Game is comin, after next summer
I predict my shit'll drop before the next Howard homecoming
Now who in the runnin, no one, ask the niggas who want it
I got a four-fifth and it just like me, it stay gunnin
Me and my niggas stay blunted fogged up in the 600
Guilty as charged, blunts in the air, guns in the doors
It's written, Compton niggas never run from the law
Plus we get Monopoly money with hotels and a board
So I'll never see a jail, and I'm allergic to bars
Can't sit behind 'em or drink at 'em, so we travel with ours
Poppin Crist' in the 6, like we drivin through Mardi Gras
Thinkin 'bout beads and titties as I roll through the city
And I keep 16 in the clip, and I let 'em all go
Like the Lakers did Ellie, Atty and Nick, huh

[Hook]
When shit get thick, niggas start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent, cause
When shit get thick, niggas start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent

[Sean T]
No garbage, we smoke molta, move big cocoa
We off the train tracks like the great space coaster
We hit real big and consistant like Sam Sosa
Prepare for war, like United States soldiers
Lock tight and rock right like grey eight oz's
I'll be hittin up spots, in them flip Range Rovers
Before you even try to play, foolish all over
Empty out yo' pockets, turn everything over
We ball out cursin yeah we keep it the sickest
When we roll by the quads in them Z-66's
Big spittin, grip kitten, that big face greed
Always dirty never clean but we live like kings
Legendary like Sting, it's a history to follow
But not known for stingin known for gettin off hollows
Shoot me a glass of Remy, nah fuck it the whole bottle
And watch me act bad and take off, full throttle

[Hook]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
I'm from a batch where it ain't no cut, we all in
36 on a triple beam scale for meal
Duffle bag on my shoulder my route, through the back of the jet
To bag up baguettes and everybody know it
I'm the iceholder makin the cut, never breakin 'em up
My favorite color is rainbowed up
Ain't a coke dealer, but I got bricks for cheap
Hit the lab for a fo' day block, we got heat
You niggas can't compete when I walk in the streets
We Get Low, and there's no idea with the info
It's a rule of thumb, let them dudes a come
I'm cruisin some, 20 inch shoes and some
I'm in the widebody XM-5, all my snakes is live
We check your five, the spot where the tec dies
And everybody gotta holla the name
It's JT from the Fillmoe streets to CPTI'm on a mission for money, dreams n' Bentleys n' Ferrarris
Influenced by the biggest ballas now bitches wanna call us
Picture me with all the cheese mansion lookin overseas
Pushin limosuines n' stackin hunits n' g'z
Dubbz on my sports car six car garage
Its like a mirage when you step off my back yard
Rollies whinnin diamonds shinnin I'm gettin mine
Them models you see on TV fuckin em' all the time
Zippin on $200 bottles of champainge
Till I'm dead in the game won't a damn thang change
I'm a boss bitch thats why I floss bitch
And we leave from the club you gettin tossed bitch
Besta believe I'm a thug keep it crackin n' stackin my mill
Taller than (??) (??) n' roll like a back down
Fuck goin' back to jail
Bitch I'm back to the hotel in my V12 wit mo' kill

[Hook]
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6
Twenty inch rims with the all chrome kit
Ballin like king tut two rollies

Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6
Twenty inch rims with the all chrome kit
Ballin like king tut nigga what
Two rollies somebody better hold me

You see me sliddin up not givin a fuck we done been up
Throwin up the mob down the block so bring it up
I be flossin in my Mercedes wit yo lady
Got her tossin zippin on Baileys we do it daily
It ain't NOOOO bitch livin up on this earth that can play me
It ain't NOOOO snitch livin up on this earth that can hate me
I be sideways shakin dick up on the highway
Havin it my way I think it was a Friday better yet a Thursday
Thinkin about the first day my CLK went to hit the bay
It was a true figga young mob figga make mans skrilla
Gettin close up on the trigga
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6 seee
TVs in the back seat
Now police wanna catch me
Cuz I'm livin large $80,000 cars
A young ghetto star no matter who you are

Chorus

I put dubbz on my Benz got my 64 lifted
Swimmin in money because I'm gifted
Livin the life of a rap star Bentleys n' double R's
Ride luxury cars flossin wit allstars
Catch me overseas counting g'z and they hate it
Mad cuz a thug nigga done made it
Wanna see me down and out bank account on rip
You players haters you can suck a fat dick
I put the gat to yo lip breath smellin like shit no breathin
To the wizard of oz hard courage is what you needin
Beat up n' get up out it before I draw down
Wit a 44 caliber desert eagle got shit locked down
Like a dog pound and we all down
For that dubb C L mafia loc
Ain't no stoppin us loc
Not unless you poppin us loc
I'm a floss across town like the president
Flip a yay and dont touch no evidence
Baller Style!

Chorus

[Killa Tay]
I'm a cap pilla you fuckin wit some real killas
Ride through my 9 milla on cock like a dike bitch
I'm bellin it tight bitch
My profile ain't rightous I'm a thug lord
I got whatever you need like a drug store
Hard core killin off all enimies
Them dollies crackin speed knum you on my g'z
I be ballin like Rasheed Wallace but fuck college
All a nigga need is my heat and some of this street knowledge
Get some dollas straight thuged out
Put up in yo chest n' still holla all in my mouth tryin to get popped out
But I burn rubber on hood rats we ridin high speed
Cuz I like to drop E off Remy and weed
I'm through the town like the HIV
Regulatin strikin dirty wit a fake ID
Instead of hatin I be chassin this paper hard status
Its in my nature still copin kids never potin licks wit no fakies

Chorus[ VERSE 1: JT The Bigga Figga ]
We play hardball, runnin these streets in different routes
Make the paper count, stuffed in the couch, we got clout
All I talk about is cheddar-chasin, we in the Jets
In a parking lot in a bubble goose rockin a vest
So we mean-muggin, whole trunk full of goodies
Burner gloves, Timbos, Levis and the hoodies
I'm in and out of B-210, juice & gin
Crack the window when you smokin them bidi's, pass the Hen
Overdrive in the passenger side, my niggas ride
For the westside, 415, ????
By the look in his eyes, you never been around the block though
Bustin off rounds or crack dealin to keep it hot tough
Dancin with the shift, get skirtin, illegal motion
Stoppin for the cops and it's curtains, so keep coastin
When they dust for prints ain't no punks in this
And if they ever bring the drama get the pumps for this

[ Chorus: Cosmo ]
We ain't got shit to lose but much to gain
We young thugs who done felt much pain
Drug dealers who touched caine
Stuck in the game like 'fuck fame'
Makin weak cats tuck they chains
Ain't nothin changed

[ VERSE 2: Killa Tay ]
I serve a punk quick like Serena and Venus
Foul language, broken English, but my style's the cleanest
I was born on the East but I reside on the West
Officially Supernatural, so I ride to the death
Express my plans to my fans, put my spirit in lyrics
Eternal threats after a mic check, let the whole world hear it
They call me Mister Mafioso, the one and only
Runnin a mob, gettin the job done, no love for the phoneys
I'm representin WCM to the fullest, my nigga
Pullin strings like a trigger, posted up with the stigma
I lay my hat somewhere in ???? protectin my family
My homies ain't understandin me cause they live in a fantasy
I got deep ties and I'll keep wise, respect from the West to the Eastside
These gees ride just to put it down in my British Knights and my Levis
But now we all O.G., livin casual, ready to travel
Ain't no equal to this God Mob crew, who wanna battle?

[ Chorus: Cosmo ]

[ VERSE 3: Cosmo ]
We livin in the last days where gats spray
Hittin cats from blocks away
Crooked cops tryin to stop the pay
They think we rockin lley
Tryin to monitor the ways that we operate
Cause we won't cooperate
We stay large, we break jawbones and get our ball on
On the block hustlin dope till it's all gone
I'm almost all grown, I got a .380 Beretta and it's all chrome
I know I'm all wrong for all the thug livin and drug dealin
I put my ears to the streets but all I'm hearin is these slugs peelin
When they come killin ain't no words fo'
All you seein is beanies, black pistols and herb smoke
Dirty money wrapped in rubberbands
Young killas dyin over scrilla, I heard he went out over a hundred grand
Penitentiary cells blocks
Is full of young thugs who ain't got no choice but to sell rocks
I know my future was planned for me to succeed
I'd die to see my homie G-Spot and mama live free
A lotta suckers wanna get me, plottin on seein me
Dead, got they Glocks aimed for my kidneys

[ Chorus: Cosmo ][Game]
The young Roy Jones of this rap shit
Somebody 'bout to get knocked the fuck out tonight, man

[Verse 1 - Game]
Niggas think they got the Game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black nine, black Wifey Airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece, and yeah
When the beef cooks, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that means your sheeps is dead
Then I'm going, going, back, back to the block
To dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggas know I'm good with the Glock
They call me Chick Hearns cause if the Game on knock, I'm callin' the shots
I wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm the LOX
Then get gangsta with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die bury me with the Glock
And a bucket of shells in case niggas want drama in hell

[Hook - Bootleg]
I'll give you anything you ask for
Money over bitches!
Tell me what you blast for
We don't fuck around with snitches!
What you have to smash for?
These niggas tried to play me, man
Anything you ask for
It's all about the Bay, Game

[Verse 2 - Bootleg]
First things first, money over bitches, fuck hoes
Say my name in vein; watch Game break the bones in your noes
I'm a Flint Town rider, Inner City flipper
My whole squad in flip mode like they name was Rah Diggah
Sword Jinted on, Bootleg, bitch I'm a general
Saw draw your firearms when you in the presence of criminals
And motherfuck subliminals, metaphors or adjectives
I come to where you live and shoot sixty rounds inside your crib
Killer by instinct, murderer by nature
Killa Cali earthquake ya, show nothin' but bone breakers
Bitch it's nothin', like puffin' on this dust-for-ass pound
The caine in my tana have your mouth twisted just like Bobby Brown
Fuck what you might've read, fuck what your people said
Back in this bitch in '06 it's the Game and Leg
Highly aniticipated, the day this finally came
I'll smack a patch of meat off a nigga head for Game

[Hook][Verse 1]
Sittin' fat on twenty inches, yeah and kickin' the flow
I used to be in the corner on my five point toes
Wrote raps with meaning, flashback to my younger days
In the summer, wanted her number but then she turned away
She turned the channel see my face on the screen
Now she havin' visions about replacin' my queen
Brought up the cream but she wouldn't see a nickel see a track
With comps on the big in the middle
Tryin' to fit em' now because of my fame
Y'all need support keep lovin' the name
Pushin' the Range with a dot in the six
I'm heavy in the mixed and you coughed on my tit

[Hook x4]
We balled out, we grind out, we shined out
And when you see me on the tv then you find out

[Verse 2]
What they know about court life, locked down on titaniums
Saved a pocket full of them yays because they payin' em'
That's nothin' balled out shined out we big timin' on some other shit
Collectin' them faces they fit us fine
It's no surprise we pullin' up in the best
All leather with the wood grain rest, nothin' less
Confess we used to solve it all but gangstas know who we are
Playstation it's connect in each and every car
Gold teeth and French braids or the full fades
Bring it all together and bibble cause we all paid
Over-nighters on airplanes get the red-eye
Face to face negotiations and we keep it better
Now dig this, you say you wanna get the cheddar
Face to face negotiations and we keep it better
And all money ain't good money
You can't tell on the streets we determined to make mail

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Shhh, I get with it no problem, hundred G's I got em'
Five hundred Benz on twenty lone pros and drop em'
Livin' life me and my wife sittin' on the hill and we plush
Hey never enough and enough ain't enough
I bubble up and flip my fetti and double up
Like automatics and gauges and tech nigga is what's up, ha
I bring nothin' but that Southern Cali, Northern Cali gangbang
Mentality, so when you try to come battle me
Hit the game up with diamonds, you love the way they be shinin'
And I keep on grindin' that's when the 4-5 blindin'
Worried and nervous and nervous as fuck
I ai't got no license I ain't givin' a fuck
If you ain't got no money stay the fuck away from us
You see me in my Caddy lookin' clean as fuck

[Hook x4](E-40)
Hey, JT, you know what playboy, it's like this duke

(Celly Cel)
Beware of those faulty ass mark ass niggas snakin' in tha grass
Tryin' to take your cash cause you bubbled up to fast, the last
Nigga that tried to go against the grain, I made him feel me, mane
Cocked the Glock, put on in the chamber then I aimed
For his dome and split him like a Garcia
Vega down the middle, jumped in my car, see ya
Itchy trigger finger dumpin' on them dont-knows
Janky ass motherfuckers, mane, beware of those
(JT The Bigga Figga)
We drop bombs wit stocks and bonds and make it rappable
Financial status increasing cause everyday it's capital
But more than likely, they sure ain't real because they plastic
No money in they pockets but G-notes worth of assets
I reach out then drop check watch and get my proppers
We kicks it wit killers who hate cops and pack they choppers
So when you see me it ain't nou need for perpetratin'
Stay the fuck up out my face because I know you playa hatin' me
(E-40)
Yeah, I still be my young Frisco city comrade
Makin' these niggas midnabb
Postin' up in tha lidnabb
Pilin' up that cidnash
Champagne wishes, pussy fallin' up out the pockets
Thick ass ... surrounded by docters, chocolate ...
The niggas that you be thinkin' that's always out to getcha
Ain't always tryin' out to getcha
Sometimes them real niggas that be witcha that's out to getcha
That's why me keeps my tossed pistolas on the side of me waist-a
Just in case these cape crusaders wanna erase me

(E-40)
Hey, like I was saying look he, JT
Yuo from Frisco, we from the V right
We from the labb, we networking, this is what we do
And if you ain't got tha recipe
Don't be mad if they ain't checkin' for ya
(JT The Bigga Figga)
That's real!

(Celly Cell)
I see you sittin' on them thangs and bending the block
You better be sittin' on a Glock or you'll be riding stock
The jackers see them niggas clown, just like I see them niggas
But don't be slippin' when you see me, I might be them niggas
With the choppers yellin' get out the car nigga
Hit the gas and watch me blast you ain't gone get to far nigga
Don't trust nobody cause your closest friends will turn to foes
It's double agence in this game, I know you feel me though
(E-40)
You wanna take your potnas win, from me tell my why
Man y'all was potnas tryin' together nigga knee-high
How's the fuck you just gone transport my ... wear
Over some he say she say shit man dude you out there
(JT The Bigga Figga)
Approaching my status feeling flavor never saving hoes
Breakin' doors try to trickin' some niggas in candy painted vogues
Marinatin' wit my boys from the V
We gets our paper stacks our chips and than we strike on z's
We wraps our ki's tight to keeps our G's right
Gotta get that money so we can be upon the next flight
Not a dab but a smidgen play my game on precision
We dropped the bomb that'll make things come
Then they fly like some pigeons
It's goin' down, but ain't no need for extra talkin'
How many straps up in the house, you best to get to walkin'
Cause in the '95 these niggas go for broke
Get up off that kamikaze in you face and end of smoke
Beware of those

(E-40)
Hey, this is my philosophy right here
I feel it's enough cornbread out here for everbody

You know what I'm saying, I mean just think about it
I'm mean we, it's a gang of motherfuckers out there
And we tryin' to change this shit, this the new dope game

(JT The Bigga Figga)
Tokens, yeah
(E-40)

Quick to scratch up a playas pocket an keep on poundin this shit

Verse 2 *(Mac Mall)*

Appear quiet, bust in my grill

Pullin hundreds an toss the keys to LA

Under
We be countin crispy federal notes
Cuz I ain't tryin to sell dope

Looking like we'll smuther everybody
Kamakazi bout this money don't try me

In this, we the titans to meet
Juss a day in the life of the elite
So don't hate me, hate the game
You hate it cuz you workin wit small change

We sharper than a needle, an I bust it wit my people
Get leathal if I hit ya wit this sleeper
Ain't too hard to reach ya
Like a teacher seat ya in a corner like a dunce
Cuz ya known as a clone and performer of them stunts
And I'm tired of givin warnings to punks

Back up in this game our dope is faulty
These niggas actin shady got they pistols in they pockets
But these fools don't wanna play me they be
I been thinkin about this game that I'm spittin
Got homies on the block that pack they choppers and put their hands up
In them leather minis
They won't hesitate to squeeze the trigger
They lay you out on the ground and go into your pockets then they take
Your figures
Aggrivated aggression they niggas smoke with the sesses (?) with Philly
Blunts Garcia Vegas and them Smith-N-Wessons
Packin Tech-Nines these niggas actin fine then they snappin
Can't trust no Fillmoe niggas in the middle of the night then they
Cappin
Gotta get away and I betcha they'll sweat ya
They'll get to the spot and grab they choppers and drive around until
They catch ya
And then they buckin and blastin and fools be mashin and dashin
Paper shortage on the block so fools be actin scandalous
Comin up in this game these fools be faulty it's pitiful
Keep your game to a minimal this shit is critical

Foul from the start a young buck be rollin
Badder than the baddest cause the baddest is devoted
Three young G'z growin up on the West side
Down from the start in the dark for the hoo-ride
Mackin on the scene every day of the week for the moment
Checkin the opponent cause you know we up on it
Never whatever makin a move so clever
Changin the program like the weather so now you know they clever
Creepin through the scene huntin for the green
Lookin for the man who got what they need
Now it's on so break it off somethin terrible
Viscous as they come you know it's unbearable
G got a Mac-10 D got a Mac-11
Seff got a Glock 17 send em straight to heaven
So now you know the definition when the drama's on
Watchin your back packin your strap stayin out the danger zone
That's how it is when the niggas up to no good
Creepin through the sucka hood man a nigga sure would
Catch a bitch by the back of his knapsack
Slippin on the dope track got a fat ass stack
And niggas up on his shit extra clips on hip ready for the big lick
Like my boy from the V says skee-skert
Bad ass youngstas mane doin dirt

(chorus)
Doin dirt cuz we dirty when the trigger pulls
Doin dirt cuz we dirty when the trigger pulls

(Gigolo G)
Rollin in a G ride plottin a lick
See a out of town nigga squattin on gold kicks
Ridin 6-4 drop he was sittin on Vogues
Bumpin the beat hi-sidin for the hoes
He tried to dip off fast but I was at that ass
Nigga clippin the nine cuz it was time to blast
Popped five times put holes in the 6-4
He gave it up smooth to the gangsta Gigolo
Hopped in the drop rushed him straight to the spot
Left the shit on crates in the parking lot
Lifestyle of a gangsta is the only way to get paid
Fuck a nine-to-five cause a jack is the trade
And blame it on the 8-Ball 211 is in season
I smoke foul joints let that be the reason
Goin nowhere fast always ready to blast
No time to sleep do the shit in my past
I'm just a killa to be killed so it feels no guilt
Tearin up shit when your boy's on tilt
Bitch made niggas gets fucked in the game
It's the nigga Gigolo and ain't a damn thing changed

(chorus)

I remember back in the days when everybody had funk
This side and that side peepin like a mothafucka
But now days you got to watch your own kind
Cuz the one next to you is the one with the Tech-9
He just bought it so he feel like he got stripes
Got a extra clip ready to take a nigga life
And it just might be you
Cuz ya bucked his bitch and ya stepped on his shoe
On accident but that is irrelevant
He wanna start drama just for the hell of it
And to think you used to go to school with this nigga
Now ya'll got bigger and he ready to pull the trigger
You say fuck it let's throw them thangs
He say fuck throwing thangs it's the nineties mane
And uh he wanna pop pop and a tat tat
Put you on your back cuz you ain't got your gat
No good cuz the nigga's a sucka
Wanna be a gangsta but he's a punk mothafucka
Like my boy from the V says skee-skert
Bitch type ass niggas mane doin dirt

Quick to test yo d-boy clout an leave ya laid out

We both know that the moss will leave yo ass dead
I run the hood like a jungle
King of the beast
Head hunters after me, I make 'em all bleed
Fuck the rollas man, they betta not run up on my plot
Cuz I won't dump until I drop my semi on cops
Blowin my top

Niggas wit mo mail
This Cali livin' ain't no jokin
Paper chasin on my hustle to the day I go broke
Satisfied wit my riches
Never that I keep it goin wit my
Cut him all in the back of a bucket we blowin
Test the nuts of these ridas
Man it's on, on sight
Got my pistol in my pocket an I'm ready to strike

They say they want me locked up or dead in the dirt
They got me ballin' spendin' dollars tryin' to get me off erk
Cause me and my cold click we come real shit, we got to work
And money ain't a thing, we dealin' with change and them first
And at the worst can get I lost a punk bitch
I dumped that the folks tryin' to get at some bullshit
Who said we gay, who said us niggas don't play
Menace City and the PB niggas is a un-soft case
And if ya niggas got something to say
Bitch ass niggas we don't play
Say it in my face, if it's negative talk game
And positively I let the Glock ring man
We don't bang, we get bitch niggas out the lane
Before the next motherfuckin' lane cross game
Or try to sprinkle salt on these young niggas name
That's why we makin' a statement, fuck everything

[Hook x2]
In Fillmoe, Fillmoe we don't play
Fillmoe it goes down every day
In Fillmoe, where every man stacks pay
Fillmoe, only the strong survive man

[Verse 2]
It's time for action, my main focus is only the stackin'
Stuck in this ghetto habitat without a way out
We ghetto platinum and no doubt ya get addicted to the street life
Hustlin' heavy tryin' to duck and dodge from three strikes
Caution cause niggas is shady from here to Boston
Sometimes flossin' talk shit behind ya back often
I spit the truth in every line that I speak
It's hard times nigga, get your's cause I'ma get mine completely
From city to city and coast to coast
We man-made ghetto stars that y'all bitches wanna toast to
Y'all can't even come close to, we larger than life
Don't dare to step up to this squad here, it's lonely after midnight

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
It's all hypee, knowin' these suckers never liked me
Rather see me in a jail cell with a federal indictment
Nigga, copyin' mafia on my own two
When I come through ride for the West, we all up on you
Ya whole crew, hate and despise when they look through the eyes
Of this real one, rushed through the dirt and pulled him out
And that's for real son
Never be at rest and that a lesson
When the beef hit and when ya get that ya get the blessin'
That's round talk, when shit get thick we see who sticks
And half of the click jump ship and straight split
Ice in the grip, they sell you out of yo location
Ya set back, wakin' ya up with home invasion

[Hook x2]Chorus:
This is goin' out to the youngstas
The nappy headed gappy little rumblas
The ones robbin' stores and them banks and shit
Wit the tec-9 gats and them xtra clips
The ones wit the Glocks, the ones wit the 45's
Runnin' 'round the streets doin' homicide
So peep game from ya boy Bigga Figga
And let me tell ya how the shit go

1978
A young nigga born, growin' up around the way
Born without a daddy shot in the proces
Vietnam war, cause he didn't wear a vest
Moms was broke, no money in the bank
Cause when they was young they used to smoke a lotta dank
Been graduated to the dope and the booze
Couldn't afford milk, couldn't afford shoes
Livin' in the projects not tryin' to get out
Wellfare is poppin' and she's tryin' to find a spout
Son coming up and seeing this shit
No time for school cause he gotta pull a lick
By this time he did to my click
Tomorrow is the first and they all wanna flip
Red light bandit's caught red handed
Now we in the hall when they left his butt stranded
Councelor, councelor can I use the phone?
Now he kinda scared and he wanna call home
No type of guy that's in no type of teaches
... tried to warn him but she seems she couldn't reach her
...
Goin' to the ramp, sorta like a summer camp
In a few weeks he get a home-pass soon
When he hit the streets man you know he gonna boom
Moms can't tear him off nuttin' but a hug
But a few close homies gonna show a little love
A dub sack here and a dank sack there
Who ever said that life was fair
Now he got a warrant cause he didn't wanna go back
P.O. ain't shit and he ain't cuttin' no slack
Now he on the streets and he can't be slippin'
Cause at the hall we got a y.a. commitment
It ain't gettin' better it's only gettin' worse
I stroke a bad luck, better yet a bad curse
The system is set for us to straight failures
Ask the O.G's any black man will tell ya
On the way to comin' up, got about a G
And about 2 O's two more will make a QP
Gangstas watch ya back, homies gettin' down
One more week he be on a half a pound
That's half of a half of a cake ya know
Gettin' so large they need to call him Mr. Blow
Or better yet, call a nigga Mr. B12
Gettin' clientele for makin' the shit swell
Cause back on the street there's a drought on the shit
Got to make some money, so it's time for a lick
Watchin' out for the neighbourhood baller, a little bit taller
Then the next nigga tryin' to pull a motherfuckin' trigga
Plottin', scheming, waitin' for the beamer
To pull up so he can run up and put the gun up
To the dome, so we can get the cash flow
But little did he know that the baller was a pro
And waitin' for jackers and all type of niggas
Wit automatic trigger just waitin' to give a
Rat-tat-tat and a pop-pop at a young buck
Now he stuck and they couldn't give a motherfuck

ChorusNiggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Shit nobody knows, knows, knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
See nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
We got game for sale

[Verse 1]
How I do it, I put this spunk right into it
Act like I never knew ya, blast and run right through ya
Bust ya in the head with something
Bet ya my nigga we ain't playin'
Break the safe and start payin'
I got whatever ya need, big faces
For dollars I'm chasin' if I want it I take it
Ain't no mystery or no myth when I'm takin' ya shit
And you'll be history just dead in a ditch
Young Daz the assassin I hold it down for my crown
Huh, I lay it down for the whole Dogg Pound
How that sound, a nigga playin' me out
Ya get pound with no doubt we bustin' ya mouth
Young nigga

[Hook]
All I wanna do is put my hands on some dough
Reach in my pocket and everybody on the floor
See around my neighborhood nobody knows
What niggas might do to put they hands on some dough
All I wanna do is put my hands on some dough
Reach in my pocket and everybody on the floor
See around my neighborhood nobody knows
What niggas might do to put they hands on some dough
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
See nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
See nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Peep game

[Verse 2]
On a street train pushin' my thoughts, we got hustle
For the right price hittin' the lab we got buckles
Tech notes, look at me slow with face won't
Project game travel to city
We take over ya mind frame
Do some things ya can't did
We made men, complete with cash ya can't spend
Mind balls, but not that mind ya used to
The new crew, hard knock life we too cool
We made that, we call strikes from way back
And take that, cell phone calls they can't track
Face slaps, see this shit from roof tops
When the drought here, can't outrun the two cops
The foot work spot and move we cop them dues
Keep the big face in they socks and shoes
Raised by old timers and laced with old game
Bait and switch partner and take the whole thing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo, hey yo
All I wanna do is put my hands on some Benjis
Drink Remy Martin until it's empty
Slap twenty-twos on the Bentley
It's niggas like you who been tryin' for centuries
We'll still touch em' like Ren and Stimpy
The train still rockin' big body Benzy in a frenzy
Pocket full of stones like Pimp C on ya ten speed
Don't tempt me, niggas layed up with the semi for ten G's
I'm simply rock for the block and penitentiaries
It's red dream shit and "Thug Lord" shit
Take them niggas to park quick, make em' forfeit
This the ayatollah, the number one spot holder
Glad ya Glock sewed up, take the rap and it's over
Told ya I'm the tightest motherfucker upon em'
Dustin' em' all and fuck y'all niggas suck balls
And I buck y'all with my niggas Ball and Daz dilly
Fingerprint the mac milli and slap his ass silly

[Verse 4]
I was a ho wet dream, a broke bitch nightmare
Serve her game before we start the affair
Mac usually never bless no squares
Suckers say yo prayers and have mine when I get there
Plus I use a M-5 for you to get yo live
Mr. Jesus ho gave yo about loot
Niggas bossin' for that chastity and game too
Cops dis and out front y'all few
That's out, so every motherfuckin' sentence count
I shook the game butt naked and made it work my route
Make my name taste like a Glock nine in ya mouth
Make a name, hang out with Roger Trout boss game, 535 stash
Independent and Mac owned, I leave the sahde trees alone
Man I'm about to have this shit sewn
Dillinger and Yuk and nigga now I'm three
Cut up and smash on they ass with no apology

[Verse 5]
I got heat for you niggas, speed for you niggas
Thought I couldn't come with official game
It ain't for play, I ain't playin'
Take the dollar squad name
I split duck and hit toke and take this to the brain
Fool I do the damn thing, I bust so tremendous
So what's at stake for those that fake and hate
Old niggas have to deal with little
Followin' fetti trails I head to the ghetto
Doin' dirt in the gritty ghetto
It's young T-Bone stackin' P
I bet a grand, standin' next to me is Samuel C
I'm Everclear a hundred proof and I'm hard to drink
My Ph is like ya throwin' a case
This game is for sale

Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
Shit nobody knows, knows, knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
See nobody knows
Niggas got game for sale, niggas got game for sale
We got game for sale
