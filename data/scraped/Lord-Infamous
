[Lil' Wyte]
Go on and slip me two Xanax Bars - I'm ready to git fool
5th of Crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game - in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system - man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope - Blueberry from Texas
You wanna git up in rotation that's too bad cause I'm stressing
By now its 1:30 am - 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second - I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to calm me down and let me see
Body be relaxed - muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up wit' the fussing and discussion - I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gotta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

(Chorus 2x - [Lil' Wyte])
Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Exctacy - and it's all up for grab
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane

[Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow, scarecrow whats that you popping?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it's so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange's with the black O-C
Take two and you cannot move up out your seat
Some people melt em' down in a needle and shoot 'em up
But I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck

[Crunchy Black]
See I'm a pill popper - so I'mma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'mma start droppin' em
There ain't no stoppin' 'em - when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em - can you help me get some
I heard you have Clidina, on that fucking pill shit
Gimme some fuckin Ec' - gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town

(Chorus 2x - [Lil' Wyte])
Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Ecstacy - and it's all up for grab
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane[Juicy J]

And let her sip syrup and make her body slow
Then take her to a room, make her suck and blow
They act a damn fool with that acid mane
And put it on they tongue then they go insane
I think its kinda wild, they be out the frame
But like the commercial, this is your brain on drugs
(eggs scrambling in background)

Have ya runnin' round drinkin listerine
Doing bout a hundred cold switchin' lanes
Take a X pill then ya wanna bang
Get a little freak take her to your home
Stuck ya dick in with no rubber on
Three days later you be on the phone
Tellin' yo doctor "She Burnt Me Joe"
Thats what ya get unprotected sex
Then ya took a pill called percocet
It might keep you calm, but your still a wreck
The key little shots keep ya in the mix
I know a young nigga out in Hollywood
Who said he got sprung off Dog Food
He stuck a needle in his arm Ouchie-oooo
And then it made him feel like Awwww-cool

Scarecrow is the dictionary table of contents of drugs
If you describe it, I could tell you what the fuck it was
Now if your getting very drowsy, you feel very down
That must be heroin, I only sniff that Funkytown
The only marijuana that the Infamous will blow
Is purple kush and white willow or I break down that dro
Dromo tabs and percocet, just before I get out bed
Break out the bag of blow and take about four to the head
Lord must have his medicine, plenty yellow purple syrup
Purest herb, very perved, feel superb, to the curb
Snotting up them railroad tracks, mack having a heart-attack
Take a Xanax, put it back, bitches bout to get attacked
Sometimes I may get down with the crystal methamphetamine
Niggas stay up early, I will strain my eyes on your high beams
????????? ??? I stay high as fuck
Lord should take a piss test
I would melt right through the fucking cup

[1st Verse]
Sacred Black Magic from the deadly Voodoo Powers
Secret sayings said before the midnight hours
Mystic Styles of the ancient mutilations
Horrifying chaos shadows somethings in my basement
People, Lord Infamous will take the damn replacement
For the one called Satan when he's up on his vacation
"Thou Shall Not Kill" the description in the scripture
I murder me more victims than the one called Adolf Hitler
People want to live but they know we can not stand it
Want to blow up every motherfucker on this planet
If you try to catch a better [?] it's in the attic
Tryin' to enter apartments while people partake in the use of Black Magic
There should be a bit when you wish to stop the madness
The Triple 6 Mafia we'll burn your ass to ashes
Shooting the poisonous venoms of terror
Injecting into your blood vessels remember
You fuckin' with the triple six you fuckin' with the curse of the wicked black devils
Damn I'm crazed

[2nd Verse]
I talk to myself cause there is no one to talk to
I am the cool damn fool that will shoot you
I think of murda, murder on me mind-ah
Murder on the menu, murder all the time-ah
Murder with the .45, murder with the nine-ah
Murder, a murder is my favorite crime-ah
Blood on my street and blood on my hands-ah
Blood on my shirt and blood on my pants-ah
Niggas they die, many die, die, die, niggas
I pull the trig-, pull the trig-, pull the trigga
Let's dig a grave, dig a grave, the gravediggas

Come walk with me, journey to the edge of hell-ah
Fire arms, fire storms, bring your umbrella
Endo's creating illusions of greater, the unknown, amazed
Damn I think I'm Crazed[Hook]
Murderer, robber
Psychopathic, schizophrenic

[DJ Paul]
Now it's a nigga all on the dick
Of the six double six
Mafia niggas pull them triggas

It's a pimp type nigga
But you don't understand me
A Tec medallion on my rope
A Tec ruger in my hang, g
Shootin' on these suckers who got anna
Because I won't produce them a track
So I react by puttin' a bullet in they back
These niggas got problems, let it be known, ho
My .380'll solve 'em, like a psychiatrist
And yo this nigga be jealous when they see how strong my pimpin' be
Pick the ho one day, the next day she's workin' the street
I got game for 'em because these busters so lame
It ain't a thing man for me to work a bitch man
I got money in my pocket from these hoes that I got
Been about my busi-ness, peepin' inside my fat stack
This Tec-9 makin' these motherfuckers panic
Held in the hand by a psychopathic schizophrenic

[Hook]

[Lord Infamous]
My name is Lord Infamous
Chainsaw blades grind down to the gristle
Stab you in your motherfucking face or hizzead with the chisel
Pistols, knives, niggas lives ain't worth a nickel
Slice, blind eyes, Antichrist with the sickle
Scarecrow, demonic schizophrenic hell dweller
Pieces of decomposed bodies they fill up the bloody drawers down in my cellar
I need to quit drinking the liquor and chiefin' the blizzunts
That's full of the reefer and we are the intoxicated suspects
It may be all the reasons why I feel these niggas must bleed
The evil seed, dead vultures in the trees
Intense pain, black razors in the breeze
Degrees, 600 Fahrenheit 66 Celsius
Lord Infamous the Scarecrow
Stab my pitchfork in your guts
Don't hide just because Lucifer is coming
He knows all your secrets, no escape so why you running?
But you's a gangster motherfucker, prove that shit you sell
My name is Lord Infamous fool and I sleep in hell

[Hook]

[Project Pat]
I'm the one you don't fuck with so don't even try me
A motherfucking soldier, you gon' have to kill me
Kill me you bitch ass boy that's what I said
A murderer, robber, I'll stab you in your head
I'm realistic to the god damn bone
You say you got a gang? Goddammit bring it on
Cause niggas trip me out always trying to playin' that they hard
Ridin' around the hood shootin' up a nigga's car
A car ain't alive and a car ain't the nigga
You sayin' I'mma die? Motherfucker pull the trigga
I figured you's a ho when I first caught you slippin'
Fool it's Project Pat and I'm game for a killin'
Now thinkin' I'mma run, that's a stupid ass mistake
You say you got a gun, I got a gun and I ain't fake
I'll take all the time that it takes this ain't a try
Cause when I catch your ass, lame nigga you gon' die

[Hook][Hook]
Overdosing on some potion not knowing all wasn't well

So prepare to come back with me to hell

My sector of Hades amazed demonic crazed a wicked race
Come back with me to hell
I'm cannibalistic for blood and I want me a taste
Erasing the every damn trace of your waste

[Verse 2]
I was dozing at the night house

No doubt, but I took the wrong route
In my haze, I'm over-wasted

Start feeling my life fading
Oh my God have I forsaken?
Awaken by demonic yells
My body has a metallic shell
And then the flames began to swell
Hoof prints in me everywhere
Rap many so foul hell yeah but I didn't want to be down there
Praying "Lord please bring me back"
Torture scarecrow to the max
Heard somebody yell clear
Shocked me back from cardiac
Paramedics with the paddles with the oxygen masks
History a blast, had a stroke, and my kidneys locked
Marked the dialysis, my right leg gone, man I'm shot

Dollar on swole
Take me a scoop
Put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd
Knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws
Don't make me pull it out

[2nd Verse]
Madmax, thunderdome, crystal
Huffin' on broke glass, grippin' on Pistols
(?) mercenary black ops squad man

Bounty hunter, doomsday motherfuckin' assassins
Kick in the entrance they call mr. blastin
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Do some wicked shit, with the torture pliers
Opiates, benzos and amphetamines
Tussionex, roxies, promethazine, codeine
Kushbush smoke 'bout to strangle
No breath internally
I think I'm 'bout to bleed to death
I think my braincells are obliberated
..................
Lord Infamous my flesh is tortured by an addiction
Most of my life I see these demonic visions

Murderer, robber
Psychopathic, schizophrenic

[DJ Paul]
Now it's a nigga all on the dick
Of the six double six
Mafia niggas pull them triggas
Let him feel the lead
It's a pimp type nigga
But you don't understand me
A Tec medallion on my rope
A Tec ruger in my hang, g
Shootin' on these suckers who got anna
Because I won't produce them a track
So I react by puttin' a bullet in they back
These niggas got problems, let it be known, ho
My .380'll solve 'em, like a psychiatrist
And yo this nigga be jealous when they see how strong my pimpin' be
Pick the ho one day, the next day she's workin' the street
I got game for 'em because these busters so lame
It ain't a thing man for me to work a bitch man
I got money in my pocket from these hoes that I got
Been about my busi-ness, peepin' inside my fat stack
This Tec-9 makin' these motherfuckers panic
Held in the hand by a psychopathic schizophrenic

[Hook]

[Lord Infamous]
My name is Lord Infamous
Chainsaw blades grind down to the gristle
Stab you in your motherfucking face or hizzead with the chisel
Pistols, knives, niggas lives ain't worth a nickel
Slice, blind eyes, Antichrist with the sickle
Scarecrow, demonic schizophrenic hell dweller
Pieces of decomposed bodies they fill up the bloody drawers down in my cellar
I need to quit drinking the liquor and chiefin' the blizzunts
That's full of the reefer and we are the intoxicated suspects
It may be all the reasons why I feel these niggas must bleed
The evil seed, dead vultures in the trees
Intense pain, black razors in the breeze
Degrees, 600 Fahrenheit 66 Celsius
Lord Infamous the Scarecrow
Stab my pitchfork in your guts
Don't hide just because Lucifer is coming
He knows all your secrets, no escape so why you running?
But you's a gangster motherfucker, prove that shit you sell
My name is Lord Infamous fool and I sleep in hell

[Hook]

[Project Pat]
I'm the one you don't fuck with so don't even try me
A motherfucking soldier, you gon' have to kill me
Kill me you bitch ass boy that's what I said
A murderer, robber, I'll stab you in your head
I'm realistic to the god damn bone
You say you got a gang? Goddammit bring it on
Cause niggas trip me out always trying to playin' that they hard
Ridin' around the hood shootin' up a nigga's car
A car ain't alive and a car ain't the nigga
You sayin' I'mma die? Motherfucker pull the trigga
I figured you's a ho when I first caught you slippin'
Fool it's Project Pat and I'm game for a killin'
Now thinkin' I'mma run, that's a stupid ass mistake
You say you got a gun, I got a gun and I ain't fake
I'll take all the time that it takes this ain't a try
Cause when I catch your ass, lame nigga you gon' die

Dump his ass down in the river I promise that nigga catfish dinner
Triple six and serial killer doped up on that loaded nigga
Bury that nigga in back of the boulevard I'm coked up on these painkillers

OV Nigga, Over 4x[Lil' Wyte]
Go on and slip me two Xanax Bars - I'm ready to git fool
5th of Crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game - in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system - man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope - Blueberry from Texas
You wanna git up in rotation that's too bad cause I'm stressing
By now its 1:30 am - 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second - I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to calm me down and let me see
Body be relaxed - muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitching 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up wit' the fussing and discussion - I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and git back in this game
Gotta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it mane

(Chorus 2x - [Lil' Wyte])
Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Exctacy - and it's all up for grab
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane

[Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow, scarecrow whats that you popping?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it's so tiny, that it catch you dragging
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange's with the black O-C
Take two and you cannot move up out your seat
Some people melt em' down in a needle and shoot 'em up
But I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck

[Crunchy Black]
See I'm a pill popper - so I'mma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'mma start droppin' em
There ain't no stoppin' 'em - when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em - can you help me get some
I heard you have Clidina, on that fucking pill shit
Gimme some fuckin Ec' - gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town

(Chorus 2x - [Lil' Wyte])
Oxycontin - Xanax Bars - Percocet and Lortab
Valiums - Morphine - patches - Ecstacy - and it's all up for grab
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane
What'cha want - what'cha need - hit me up I got you mane[Juicy J]

[Hook 4x]
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed

[Juicy J]
Now I'mma go and do it like them white folk do
Get it from the dope man I.O.U
Called tootin snow but its driftin soo
Menage-Trois awww mane dats cool
Whats in the plastic? High ass dro
The hoes that fuck smoke all my dope
Now you the type of nigga, buy a ho a rose
I'm a keep stuffin' coke up her hose
Columbian Cocktail Purie Snow
And take her to the bounce and let her throw some bows
And let her sip syrup and make her body slow
Then take her to a room, make her suck and blow
They act a damn fool with that acid mane
And put it on they tongue then they go insane
I think its kinda wild, they be out the frame
But like the commercial, this is your brain on drugs
(eggs scrambling in background)
What you know about them pill thangs
Have ya runnin' round drinkin listerine
Doing bout a hundred cold switchin' lanes
Take a X pill then ya wanna bang
Get a little freak take her to your home
Stuck ya dick in with no rubber on
Three days later you be on the phone
Tellin' yo doctor "She Burnt Me Joe"
Thats what ya get unprotected sex
Then ya took a pill called percocet
It might keep you calm, but your still a wreck
The key little shots keep ya in the mix
I know a young nigga out in Hollywood
Who said he got sprung off Dog Food
He stuck a needle in his arm Ouchie-oooo
And then it made him feel like Awwww-cool

[Hook 4x]
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed
Drank, Drank, drank that liquor

[Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow is the dictionary table of contents of drugs
If you describe it, I could tell you what the fuck it was
Now if your getting very drowsy, you feel very down
That must be heroin, I only sniff that Funkytown
The only marijuana that the Infamous will blow
Is purple kush and white willow or I break down that dro
Dromo tabs and percocet, just before I get out bed
Break out the bag of blow and take about four to the head
Lord must have his medicine, plenty yellow purple syrup
Purest herb, very perved, feel superb, to the curb
Snotting up them railroad tracks, mack having a heart-attack
Take a Xanax, put it back, bitches bout to get attacked
Sometimes I may get down with the crystal methamphetamine
Niggas stay up early, I will strain my eyes on your high beams
????????? ??? I stay high as fuck
Lord should take a piss test
I would melt right through the fucking cup

[Hook 4x]
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed
Smoke, smoke, smoke dat weed
Drank, Drank, drank that liquor
Pop them pills, snort that P[Hook]
Smokin out like Chief Wahoo hoo
Chase it down with the liquor and brew brew
Pass it round that's the way we do do
Somebody get this dope cause I'm through through

[Project Pat]
Roll up a blunt like light up the green
Eyes red as fire I'm on promethazine
Roll up another one dipped in the sizzurp
Save it for later mane cause it wouldn't hizzer
Soon as the thund-ah enters my lungs-ah
I start gettin hungry wheres that bologna
Crackers and cheese zuzus and whams
Icy white honey bun ooohh there I am
Go an light another one constantly smokin'
Turn up a 45 drankin and chokin
Started smoking weed real young with my peers
So full of dope smoke comin out my ears
Burnt fingernails ain't made no sales
Ya'll might be short an ounce or two on them scales
To hell with that fool go an take a pull
We cheefin all night and we stay gettin food

Chorus x2

[Lord Infamous]
You ask if Lord were a drug a drug
Ay what drug would Lord be he be
Yo Lord would be a pound of weed
But no stems no sticks no seeds
It's just because I believe-ah
In cannabis sa-tiv-a
In my L-U-N-G-S I keep the sticky green-ah
Puffahontis puff a peace pipe ridin on my peet-ah
Whats my favorite flower its that marijuna leaf-ah
I keep-ah O the F to O the R to D
I be on the B-L the U-N-T
I brew a cup of shrooms and break down the B-A-G ah
Purple kush pretty bush Cheech n Chong in me-ah
I'm the Scarecrow me in the Ville protecting acres
Smokin tough to bong a swisher leaf just simply papers

Chorus x2[Hook] x4
So High, The time is

Or some regular, it get'cha high tho
Some of yall like to smoke the bad bitch
Get the light green, but we like cabbage
Get the razor slice down the optic-mo

Smokin weed to us is a hobby, eyes like chinese
Smoke in my body, once im high mane
Don't try to blow it, ain't no passin

[Hook]

[Lord Infamous]
I love dope, dope loves me

The D the da da O the P the E
The C the da da O the K the E
I need the B da U the da da D
Uh, scarecrows a cloud of smoke, Always on the thunder
Puffin on the paper cus white ?? marijuana
I stay fucked up, on a daily basis
Maybe the reason I got all these cases
Extacy orange juice make me me so horny
Super pimp coked out coked out til the morning
Hydro coats on sniff snoff as I sniff sniff
Come let Lord Infamous take a wiff

[Hook]Chorus
South memphis bitch

Now it is time to get rough with the drama
Bitches you can not escape from the hunter
Evil scarecrow devil spells go deep in my soul
Blood on my clothes
Criminal hands and I must squeeze a weapon
Listen to sounds of the lead when we stepping
Infamous comes from the south territory
Listen to some of my demonic poetry
Circles of triple six men smoking gunja
Rituals with dead bodies on the furniture
So many soldiers are coming to destroy ya
Six million sinister satanic warriors
Ill skill will drill will kill
Nina milli flame a philli I will fill the enemy
With about twenty slugs to the mug one more trick in the mud quick
I want all my niggas in the south to say the shit

Chorus

The loud thump of the pump knock out chunks in the fuckin punks
South Parkway in this bitch let's all smoke a thousand blunts
My niggas over in Havana Hill packing plenty steel
All my niggas over in Clavelend Homes gangsters on the real
The Gardens, 3rd and parkway yea and Filea homes
Texas court g's ? and McLemore they cracking domes
Foote Homes, lamar terrorists yea and riverside
South memphis niggas ready for a fuckin homocide
The Southgate , ?, south ?, Trigg and Lauderdale
Snatching off the side of niggas heads with the shotgun shells
?? heights, kansas, wellington, cambrige
Try to cross south memphis man I swear you wish you never did
South memphis mother fucking south yea that's what I said
The place where plenty bloody ass ?? murderers were born and bred
When the smoke clears from the fire you will witness
All my niggas getting wild straight from fuckin

South memphis bitch(Lord Infamous)

I feel the need fa the biggidy Bud Man, Flick a flame
Then I take a puff
Life is kinda hazy when ya hittin the bag of indica
Niggas be thinkin the Scarecrow is gonna go crazy
The way I be cheifin that blink
Quarter ounce of Ink and a big ass banana leaf
See I feel the urge fa the motha fuckin herb
The cure is the herb, takin niggas to the curb
Word, top-crop why not? Motha fuckin chronic
The whole world is spinnin yo this shit is fuckin hypnotic
Bud smoke is like a killer, keepin that glass up in they chest
Killaz is rollin that blunt up with that motha fuckin budda bless
Grain, broccolli, tar sticks
Yo my nigga I can't forget the dutches, black clutches
Stashes of fuckin onion, and if ya want all ya brain cells dead
Get you a bag of the Cambodia Red
Since I keep most of the bless on the track I wanna know Blac...
Where the bud at?

[Hook]
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin for the bud

{Verse 2: Lord Infamous}
Called up the hook up wanna get a ounce of pine weed
Hoping that the narcotics don't creep up behind me
Can't have the one-timers takin out the killers
Cause bitches be bustin a nigga because we be havin the paraphenilia
We'll take out the bags to sack up the stash
Blowin on a mack joint of the cuban hash
And when we hit that bitch we don't leave shit but ash
Now its time to hit the cut and make a little cash
All sold out I heard my hook up just got busted
Can't find the bud and I'm gettin real disgusted
Callin up my homies tryin to find a new connection
Lookin for the marijuana in every direction and
Most of muthafuckas dont wanna give a nigga a straight package
Other muthafuckas got the flake ass cabbage babbage
Lookin for the niggas with the fat pregnant sacks
So yo black, yo black man, where da bud at?
