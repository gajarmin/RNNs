[Intro] [MC Lyte]
This struggle continues (x2)

[Chorus]
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

[Bob Marley]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last

Nobody can stop us now, we need to [?]
We can't be bought nor sold
You can pay alright [?] your children every night
Life is much more than gold

[Chorus]
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

[Bob Marley]
The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte]
We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don’t really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]
J-A double M-I-N
We be jammin from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jammin in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I ‘naw be no rap star
Exodus when i bust
See the struggle i must
Realize it ain't just
But whats next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jammin (yes)

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
We be jammin
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
The struggle continues

[Bob Marley]
Jam’s about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can’t resist
So jam by my side
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
And we’re jammin in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
We’re jammin right straight god (from god)
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Yes, (Iya)
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We jamming (Know the man behind the name)
Hope you like jamming too[Verse: Brandy]
Oh yeah ooh yeah
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

[Verse: Mc Lyte]
Yeah I get exotic with the melodic tune
I get hypnotic with the moon
But you got to put me down soon
I flip a sideshow if you come my way
Up, down, and around, even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get
We can go all out
I ain't afraid of the sweat, but yet
I bet you got the techniques
To freak a girl inside out
What's that all about? (oooh yeah)
Can I have some of that?
You gotta put me on
Word around town is you're nine men strong
I wanna be put on in the worst way
Since the first day
I think it was a Thursday (oh baby)
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in
Make me wanna ask “Where da hell you been?”
I like the way you be with all that personality
But I got flava too
You needs to get with me

[Hook: Brandy]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter the time
Of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Verse: Yo-Yo]
He was born twenty years ago
Just a pimp toes
Everyday new clothes
Look at the cut? Cool. Pose
On three, got tha heat, so bluff it
Sling' (censored) cause it's more than twenty duckets
Struck it, kinda rich
Now his pockets lookin' straight
Slam the deese on the Benzo
Pancake by the gate
Moms lookin' straight with her house she got
Great loungin' in her new home that's up out the state
I'll be your call mail, won't tell
You can get it when you want it
Even though you got chicks all up on you it
Don't matter, cause brother you're fly
I can't lie
I've been mackin' daddy from the corner of my eye
Now, baby bring it on
Don't be frontin' on your baby boo
All I wanna is what's up with you
How can I get with you
Seems like you got a hold on me
It must voodoo cause baby I want you

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse: Queen Latifah]
About yay short, about yay tall
About so big, about so small
About this length, about this width
About this flow, about this gift
Instinct leading me right up your alley way
Skip tha Moet, let's chill with some Alize
Nuff stress in our day
Let me massage your mind as my mental starts to play
A ghetto star's who you are
And I'll be your sexual chocolate bar
And I got to keep it strong for the cause
And you got to keep me strong for the tours
Brotherman and me, damn the family
What else could we be if no one understand us but we?
You were the first to tame me
Uh, Big Tif
I'm out

[Repeat Hook]

[Outro: Queen Latifah]
Hey here we go here we go here go now and it's on yeah
And you don't stop Brandy is in tha house and you don't stop
Until the body rock keep it on and you don't stop rock on[Verse 1]
B-boy where the fuck you at
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Who's body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

[Hook]
Keep on, keeping on cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new, keep on keep keeping on
Doin it right, right, right

[Verse 2]
Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
I guess I can, can I why not
If I wanna guess I can, can I
More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I procede to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

[Hook]

Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me, hurt me then dessert me
You better work me while you got the oppurtunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sigh your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game

[Hook][Patra]
[Now this is time for free your mind and your soul
Yo, half the story has never been told
Ladies, you got to demand what you want And what we want is respect, right?
Yo, listen up on the track here so I can feel if it rides
Freedom everytime for the sisters.. Check us, watch this]

[Queen Latifah]
Now here we go now... Listen, If Hip Hop ruled I'd be the ruler like Slick Rick
Get with this quick witted Adidas wearing chick
Papa got a brand new bag, Mama got a brand new Jag
A gold tag, I ain't no old hag
I represent not only in the kitchen, in the bedroom
But also in the boardroom so give me more room
Deny me my opportunity, you in jeopardy
Yo-Yo, set me free, oh and then let me be
[Yo-Yo]
I'm fightin' for freedom, I got the heat in case you need 'em
I'm a straight soldier, ain't nobody told ya?
Hold up on them lies, I know your games and your plans
Do whatever you can to oppress the man
But when it's time to drop the bomb bring the funkiness on
You say you never met a sister so strong, you're wrong
Now how can we be free? It takes you and it takes me to live together in harmony
And peace and love and all of the above
Sisters comin' together representing one love
No disrespect, but we gotta get it together
No matter what's the weather, sisters gotta stick together
And sisters be strong, don't let 'em steer you wrong, hold on
Cuz sisters got it goin' on, yeah

[Left-Eye]
Whoever said these are the things that you can do
And the things you ain't supposed to?
So am I further when I think I'm getting closer?
That's when I tend to think of Rosa
How Rosa took a seat to make a stand
But now in standin' we gettin' more demanding
And they never thought of plannin'
That a wish for us to sit would be a dose of this fuckin' rollercoaster
Whether tradition or religion, why you question my decision?
Why you spend up all your time tryin' to get into my mind?
How everybody and their mama gots to add to all my drama
Mad drama, hell if I'm gonna keep my dominating, feministic, hell-creating
CrazySexyCool, black ass in the palms of your player-hater's stance
My only chance of being free is to fly within me and it's illegal
To kill a fuckin' eagle
A bird is never more important than my people
I guess we didn't need him so I took away his freedom

[MC Lyte]
My spiritual awareness leads me to believe
That you're doubtin' the sisters to come with the peace
We've been together since Jah created water
The African border, celebration is in order
Pop the cork and give champagne to the stork
That brought the Lyte to my Mama in New York
African I come again + again
You kick me down I get back up I'm comin back in multiples of 10
[Nefertiti]
You know where I come from Slung
From the belly of the beast, used to speak African tongue
So I showed her, next one rolled her Slung the devil over my shoulder
I'm gettin' over cuz I'm bolder than the next
Tell me nothin' cuz I speak the real truth from the text
Who's next to flex with this s-i-s-t-e-r?
The sun, the moon, the crescent, the star; well let's see how open you are

[Me'Shell NdegéOcello]
Come and take a walk with me, closer walk with thee, see what only I can see
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
So it's back to the womb of everlasting life and truth
Let the heaven of a sister embrace you, and praise 'em of the gods
Come into the light, let it shine, blackness is fine
The blackness of the skin, the blackness of the mind

[Salt-N-Pepa]
I am who I am and that's who I be And I don't give a damn if your eyes can't see
If you can't see what I can see
That you're blind, baby, by a woman who's black
So back up, back up cuz it's on I'm-a tell ya strong what's wrong
With the world that we're living on
It ain't who ya know, it ain't what ya drive
It's about how you feel about yourself on the inside
When your self-esteem is low and they call you a ho, then you think you's a ho
But that ain't what the Lord God made you to be
I need you to see; you're black and you're freeI am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 3X)

[Milk]
Do you understand the metaphoric phrase 'Lyte as a Rock?'
It's explaining, how heavy the young lady is
You know what I'm saying King?

[King of Chill]
Yes my brother, but I would consider 'Lyte as a Rock'
A simile because of the usage of the word 'as'
And now.. directly from the planet of Brooklyn
MC Lyte -- as a Rock!

[MC Lyte]
Must I say it again? I said it before
Move out the way when I'm coming through the door
Me, heavy? As Lyte as a Rock
Guys watch, even some of the girls clock
Step back, it ain't that type of party
No reply if you ain't somebody
Get out my face, don't wanna hear no more
If you hate rejection, don't try to score
First base? You ain't got what it takes
You smile, you wink, you big fake flake
You're so pathetic you make my stomach turn
You beg, you borrow, now you have to learn

I am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 2X)

[MC Lyte]
Lyte as a Rock, or I should say a boulder
Rolling down your neck, pounding on your shoulders
Never shall I be an emcee, called a wannabe
I am the Lyte, L-Y-T-E
This is the way it is, don't ever forget
Hear the rhyme by someone else and you know they bit
All in the way, just little obstacles
Chew em up, spit em out, just like popsicles
Suckers out of my way, we're not on the same wavelength
I show stability, potential and strength
On the other hand, you are weak and unruly
Could never be a spy, cause you're just a plain stoolie

I am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 2X)

[MC Lyte]
I'm a slave, I'm a slave, I'm a slave to the rhythm
Def rhymes on the microphone is what I'm givin
Yes I am a Rock and you are just a pebble
Milk turn up the bass, and Rock adjust the levels
If a rap can paint a thousand words then I can paint a million
Wait, Lyte is capable of painting a bazillion raps
So when I say it, this is what I mean
Audio Two an alliance on the scene
And I'd like to say whassup to my producer King of Chill
Party people are you ready, jam if you will
Never underestimate Lyte the Emcee; I am a rapper who is here
To make the things the way they're meant to be
The World Ultimate, I'm here to take the title
But I had a little trouble upon, my arrival
But I got rid of those who, tried to rock me
Lyte is here, no one can stop me

I am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 2X)

[MC Lyte]
There are Hip-Hop leaders, this you know
We also have, hip-hoppers that follow
By the tone of my voice, you can tell I am a scholar
I'm also the leader of the hip-hop followers
Now get this, I'm at a jam and I'm rockin it
Suckers like a checkerboard, when black is clockin it
The grace as I ease across the stage
Bars around the audience, sort of like a cage
They laugh, cause they assume I'm in prison
But in reality, they're locked in
Once again I'll state that I can't be stopped
Cause yo, I am as Lyte, as, Rock!

I am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 6X)

I am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 4X)

I am the Lyte "a-a-a-a-a-a-as-as-a-rock" L-Y, L-L-Y-T-E
(repeat 4X to fade)I met him in a club hangin out one night
He said, "Hello I'm George.. hi Lyte!
How's everything goin, huh, how ya doin?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and umm
Can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?"
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
Cause George looked good, MMM damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin
Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

"Can it be I've stayed away too long" (2X)

I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
"She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised"
Good conversation, over the phone
He began to come for me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
That he was the only one I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
That you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care, fine legs don't lie
See cause Georgie was into making your girls cry

"Kissed the girls and made them cry" (4X)

"Kissed the girls and made them cry"
"Can it be I've stayed away too long"
"Kissed the girls and made them cry"

"Kissed the girls and made them cry"
"Can it be I've stayed away too long"
"Kissed the girls and..."

George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin vodka
I was lookin for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin up he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, "Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead"
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some longhaired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests as the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was young, he started smokin
Paid no attention when he started chokin
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
Till Georgie Porgie, crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin
Wish he was here so I could say somethin
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promise tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You never know when they'll be layin in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow..
Believe that! And don't think that it can't happen to you

"Kissed the girls and made them cry" (2X)

"Can it be I've stayed away too long" (4X)

"Kissed the girls and made them cry" (2X)[Hook] x3
Gotta what yo
Gotta get a ruffneck

[Verse 1]
I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with attitude
Who only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani sagging, timbos dragging
Fronting in his ride with his home boys bragging
Lying bout the Lyte how he knocked them boots last night
But he's a ruffneck so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Making noise with the boys up to no good
C low on the down low cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Starting beef is how he spells relief
Acting like he don't care
When all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude, the ruffneck bastard

[Hook] x6

[Verse 2]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts and everything is fitting large
But he don't gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's got smack it, lick it, swallow it up style
Drinkin' a beer, sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy,a raggamuf
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks ruff enough
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff,well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town

[Hook] x6

[Verse 3]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that don't stitch like a bitch
She'd tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
Eat sleep shit fuck,eat sleep shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
That's the rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners
Doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect
Now that's a ruffneck

[Hook] x18[Verse 1]
Hot damn, hot damn, hot damn, hot damn
Hot damn, hot damn ho, here we go again
Suckers steal a beat
When you know they can't win
You stole the beat
Are you having fun
Now me and the Aud's gonna show you how it's done
You are what I label as a nerver plucker
You're plucking my nerves you MC sucker
I thought I oughta tell you, better yet warn
That I am like a stock and my word is bond
Like James, killing everybody in sight
The code's three-six
The name is Lyte
After this jam
I really don't give a damn
Cause I'mma run and tell your whole damn clan
That you're a

[Hook x2]
Beat biter
Dope style taker
Tell you to your face you ain't nothing but a faker

[Verse 2]
Hit me why don't ya, hit me why don't ya
Milk's bodyguard is my bodyguard too
You wanna get hurt
Well this is what you do
You put your left foot up
And then your right foot next
Follow instructions
Don't lose the context
Thirty days a month your mood is rude
We know the cause of your bloody attitude

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Your style is smooth, even for a cheating mic
You shoulda won a prize as a Rakim sound-alike
Here's a Milkbone, a sign of recognition
Don't turn away, I think you should listen close
Don't boast, you said you wasn't bragging
You fucking liar, you're chasin a chuckwagon
The only way you learn you have to be taught
That if a beat is not for sale, then it can't be bought
When you leave the mic, you claim it's smoking
Unlike Rakim, you are a joke
And I think you ought to stop, before you get in too deep
Cause with a sister like Lyte, yo I don't sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
When I'm in a jam, with my homegirl Jill
My cousin Trey across the room with a posse of girls
So I step in the middle, shake it just a little
Wait for some female to step up and pop junk
Give my cousin a cue, treat the girl like a punk
Now I'm not trying to say that I'm into static
But yo if you cause it, yep, we gotta have it
Cause I ain't going out like a sucker no way
So I sit around the way for you to make my day
We can go for the hands, better yet for the words
Cause you'll be ignored, and at the same time I'll be heard
Throughout the city, the town and the country
The beat is funky, my rhyme is spunky
There is no delaying in the rhyme I'm saying
Neither are there flaws in what my DJ is playing

So sit back Jack, and listen to this, it's 10% dis
Cause I'm just about ready to fly this fist against your lips

But I'll wait for the day or night that you approach
And I'mma serve and burn ya like a piece of toast
Pop you in the microwave and watch your head bubble
Your skin just crumble, a battle's no trouble
Get my homegirls Joanie and Kiki to get stupid
This thing called hip-hop, Lyte is ruling it
I hate to laugh in your face, but you're funny
Your beat, your rhyming, your timing, all crummy
On the topic of rapping, I should write a pamphlet better yet a booklet
Your rap is weak homegirl, and it's definitely crooked

Others write your rhymes while I write my own
I don't create a character when I'm on the microphone
I am myself, no games to be played
No script to be written, no scene to be made
I am the director, as far as you are concerned
You don't believe me, then you'll have to learn
This ain't as hard as MC Lyte can get
Matter of fact, you ain't seen nothing yet
So never let me step into a party hardy
Talk to some people and then hear from somebody
'You wanna battle?' cause you know where I am
You don't wanna come in the 90's and see me at a jam
When a mic is handy, ten feet away
I stretch my arm like elastic, head like a magnet
Set assure, you know I don't play
When it comes down to it, the nitty gritty
For a sucker like you I feel a whole lot of pity

[Hook][Common talking]
Yea,Yea,Yea
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person that's Making Profit. See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

[Common]
Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

[MC Lyte]
As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

[Common]
Motion denied (pause)
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

Chorus: Bilal (singing)

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

[Common]
{hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me

[MC Lyte]
How I look working for a nigga in a kufi
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

[Common]
(yea ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream

[MC Lyte]
Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me (Common: get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a land called cash
You too slow for me

[Common]
You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

[MC Lyte]
What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(Common: try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving
(Common: oh it's like that)

Chorus

[Common]
(this, this, this really how I look at it check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

[MC Lyte]
Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (Common: yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (Common: where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

[Common]
Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

[MC Lyte]
(is that right)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Common: Say what)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (Common: and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin (Common: Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

[Common]
(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou (MC Lyte: Yea right)
Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

[MC Lyte]
(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin)
I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

[Common]
Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher

[Common talking and Bilal Singing Background]

Well there you have it ya'll
The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes
It's been the oldest profession
The whole thing is like a lesson
Ain't no second guessin
Pimps ya'll, hustlers
All that good shit
Yea, yea 2000 and forever
It'll be here
Uh, uh aiight coolIt was a caf? It was a caf on the west side
It was a caf? On
It was a caf? On the west side, midtown
It was a caf? On the west side, midtown

Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, "Shut the fuck up!"
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind

Death, it was gettin' closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin' over his girl
Another died drivin' while intoxicated
Why do people make livin' so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary

Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin' - or is dead better?

I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin' from a plane
But at this caf? Was death still callin' my name?
Or did this caf? Even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word 'Cappucino'
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin' shit, it'd be workin'
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if every time I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino

Why, oh why? Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino, Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

It was a caf? On the west side
It was a caf? On the west
It was a caf? On the west side
It was a caf? On the west

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-Y-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light? It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

[Kick this tip...
Kick this one here for me and my DJ][Intro]
To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
Rock the house, rock the house, rock the house

[Hook]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand just say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why -- you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that
Trying to get over like a fat rat
But I understand -- I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You better get down with your real crew
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

[Hook x2]

Dear John
Know this life has been filled with stress and pain
If I could, I would take it all away
All away

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
I know you gotta feel like your back is pinned against the wall most times
But in those times, you remain open
Closed minds will get you nowhere
Gotta move with no fare, so dear
I salute you
Knowing everything you've been through is just a journey
Every man must take the key
For some it's not to make the same mistakes
And fall victim to the chaos the world creates
In the heat of the moment
You can mistake an ally for an opponent
And wipe your own out
What a waste, and an evasive hate
You discover that it's too late

[Hook: 10Beats] (x2)
What you wanna do
So you wanna be ballers, shot callers
Dippin' in the Benz straight lawless
Or would you rather be fathers to your daughters?
Even though it's getting harder

[Verse 2: Common]
A letter to the better, to better the demonstration
Situation got you wishin' for ventilation
Can't a nigga breathe, trying to find what I believe
It's hard for a tree to grow when father figures leave
Plus I got a seed and my baby mama need
Smoke a little weed to keep my mind free
Only God can judge me, so to him I plead
Fifth in my hand, the myth of a man
That I should know it all and I ain't supposed to fall
Getting locked up and boxed up, protocol
Writings on the wall, fighting for the cause
Read a letter from the world and it said "It's yours"

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3: MC Lyte]
Confused with those who say they have your back
I feel your pain, I know you're under attack
To be strong in all things in all ways, just ain't real, so some stray
Lives left in hallways, death's breath is in the air
Let your thirstful life persevere
Someone once said you were chosen
Bus as you gotten older, doors are now closin'
Karma comes around
And all those silly things you did as a grown child are wheelin' down in your direction
But not all hope is lost
Gather your thoughts for the second coming
And I'm guessing you'll be stronger than you've ever been
Ever

[Hook] (x2)[Verse 1]

He knows he's leaving, not much time left
Holding on to his very last breath
I saw him last week, nervous and uptight
Losing sleep, stays up all night
Wishin he woulda used his mind and not rushed
To push in the bush but took his time
To get to know the girl he slapped skins with
Shared needles with
Wish he could go back, change the direction
But now he's got the infection
I spoke to him, gave him inspired words
I'm sure he's heard
Live by the sword, die by the sword
What's left, pray to the oh Lord
You can deny but the truth will unfold
Because the eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

[Verse 2]

I look into his eyes, but he's so high
From the crack, he thinks that he can fly
He has problems he doesn't like solving
Takes one hit, and thinks the world stops revolving
19, his eyes full of tears
He hasn't smiled at least for a year
His mom is gone cause he was high one night
While they killed her, because of the crack pipe
He's wanted by the law
Because he's robbed at least three grocery stores
He's lost, all control
Take a look, eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..

[Verse 3]

I look into her eyes, she's so young
But I know, where she's comin from
I've watched her grow, little girl down the street
White shirts and skirts with pleats
She cried, fear in her voice
Not knowing, she had a choice
Oh so sad, oh so lonely
If she knew that she's not the only
One in school that didn't use the caution
Facin, raisin a baby or abortion
Her mother said she had to leave
Who wants to be where a baby is not received
No ultimatum, she's goin to the G.Y.N
To put it to an end
She's learned a lesson I suppose
I can tell, eyes are the soul

Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..
Eyes are the soul..[Intro - Beyonce]
Fighting temptation

[Missy]
Yo Beyonce, Free, MC Lyte, y'all ready

Party people, it's good sensation
We gonna show you, how to fight temptation

[Hook - Beyonce]
I'm just fighting temptation (Yeah)
Gotta get more control (Control, yeah)
Yet it's very tempting when you ask to take me home (Home)
You know you want my love (Love)
I don't think the time is right (No)
Call when I'm ready, but it won't be tonight

[Verse 2 - Free]
We in the club, Free gully no doubt
See this real deal playa, starin' dead in my mouth
He got his crew, but I got mine too
Send a note to my table like, what you gonna do
Eye game got him spreadin' me out
In my ear dry tears, how he left his spouse
And oh, the nice cars, and impressive house
He want to run up in, I ain't no regular route (Hoooo!)
Me and the girls, we ain't stressin' out
We ain't birds, we ain't headin' south (Noooo!)
Them one nighters, that's sad and doubt
That little talk on da creep ,what you said is out
I gets cheddar, to help me do what ever
No beef with Dennis Edwards, but I fight temptation
I'm not sayin' I don't like temptation
I'm just lookin' for da right temptation, ya kno'

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - MC Lyte]
Yeah, party liked I never partyed before
I hit the door, all the dudes hit the floor
Sweet, they messin' wit the brown sugar queen
Fightin' temptation, like Layla Ali
Wit the 1, 2, let me show you what the hon' do
When I come through, wit the butta dip crew
Now, show me that you got my back
Love me from, where you at
I got eyes up, over my shoulder
If you should decide, to get closer (Hooo!)
Well then this dance, is straight over
I'm gone, and Missy's Testaroasa
"Be cool", thay what Free say
B. say, "Keep it clean but give them lee way"
All I know, it's a crazy sensation
You fine, but I'm fightin' temptation

[Hook]

[Outro - Beyonce] + (Missy) + {Free}

[Beyonce + Missy + Free + MC Lyte]
W-w-what you gonna do (Hoo-hoo)
W-w-what you gonna do (Hoo-hoo)
W-w-what you gonna do (Hoo-hoo)[Patra]
[Now this is time for free your mind and your soul
Yo, half the story has never been told
Ladies, you got to demand what you want And what we want is respect, right?
Yo, listen up on the track here so I can feel if it rides
Freedom everytime for the sisters.. Check us, watch this]

[Queen Latifah]
Now here we go now... Listen, If Hip Hop ruled I'd be the ruler like Slick Rick
Get with this quick witted Adidas wearing chick
Papa got a brand new bag, Mama got a brand new Jag
A gold tag, I ain't no old hag
I represent not only in the kitchen, in the bedroom
But also in the boardroom so give me more room
Deny me my opportunity, you in jeopardy
Yo-Yo, set me free, oh and then let me be
[Yo-Yo]
I'm fightin' for freedom, I got the heat in case you need 'em
I'm a straight soldier, ain't nobody told ya?
Hold up on them lies, I know your games and your plans
Do whatever you can to oppress the man
But when it's time to drop the bomb bring the funkiness on
You say you never met a sister so strong, you're wrong
Now how can we be free? It takes you and it takes me to live together in harmony
And peace and love and all of the above
Sisters comin' together representing one love
No disrespect, but we gotta get it together
No matter what's the weather, sisters gotta stick together
And sisters be strong, don't let 'em steer you wrong, hold on
Cuz sisters got it goin' on, yeah

[Left-Eye]
Whoever said these are the things that you can do
And the things you ain't supposed to?
So am I further when I think I'm getting closer?
That's when I tend to think of Rosa
How Rosa took a seat to make a stand
But now in standin' we gettin' more demanding
And they never thought of plannin'
That a wish for us to sit would be a dose of this fuckin' rollercoaster
Whether tradition or religion, why you question my decision?
Why you spend up all your time tryin' to get into my mind?
How everybody and their mama gots to add to all my drama
Mad drama, hell if I'm gonna keep my dominating, feministic, hell-creating
CrazySexyCool, black ass in the palms of your player-hater's stance
My only chance of being free is to fly within me and it's illegal
To kill a fuckin' eagle
A bird is never more important than my people
I guess we didn't need him so I took away his freedom

[MC Lyte]
My spiritual awareness leads me to believe
That you're doubtin' the sisters to come with the peace
We've been together since Jah created water
The African border, celebration is in order
Pop the cork and give champagne to the stork
That brought the Lyte to my Mama in New York
African I come again + again
You kick me down I get back up I'm comin back in multiples of 10
[Nefertiti]
You know where I come from Slung
From the belly of the beast, used to speak African tongue
So I showed her, next one rolled her Slung the devil over my shoulder
I'm gettin' over cuz I'm bolder than the next
Tell me nothin' cuz I speak the real truth from the text
Who's next to flex with this s-i-s-t-e-r?
The sun, the moon, the crescent, the star; well let's see how open you are

[Me'Shell NdegéOcello]
Come and take a walk with me, closer walk with thee, see what only I can see
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
So it's back to the womb of everlasting life and truth
Let the heaven of a sister embrace you, and praise 'em of the gods
Come into the light, let it shine, blackness is fine
The blackness of the skin, the blackness of the mind

[Salt-N-Pepa]
I am who I am and that's who I be And I don't give a damn if your eyes can't see
If you can't see what I can see
That you're blind, baby, by a woman who's black
So back up, back up cuz it's on I'm-a tell ya strong what's wrong
With the world that we're living on
It ain't who ya know, it ain't what ya drive
It's about how you feel about yourself on the inside
When your self-esteem is low and they call you a ho, then you think you's a ho
But that ain't what the Lord God made you to be
I need you to see; you're black and you're free[Intro]

[Hook x2: Harmony]
Heal yourself, you got to heal yourself
Heal yourself, ooohhh

[Kid Capri talks]

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
Cause it will make your nose grow like Pinocchio
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
Now it's a habit but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Cause now I'm all based out, ma dukes

[Kid Capri]
Oh man I like the way that's going down
Now why won't you do is kick a little Freddie Foxx

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man cause that's whack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

[Kid Capri]
Clap your hands to the beat, C'mon, just clap your hands to the beat
Freak it now

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwild
Soap suds on the floor, oh Al B Sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possessed by the basehead demon

[Hook: Harmony]

[Verse 4: MC Lyte]
In Elementary, Lyte had the Jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
To the whack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in Weusi Shule
Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

[Verse 5: Queen Latifah]
Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, I guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the ball
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us squeezers and you prove it to the worst
You have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

[Kid Capri]
Oh man this is Human Education Against Lies
You better know the flavor kid

[Verse 6: KRS-One]
Human Education Against Lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Before you're a color, first you're human
Teaching humanity is what we're doing

[Kid Capri]
And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
You didn't know anything about this, tell 'em Melodie

[Verse 7: Ms Melodie]
Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Mom is scared, she doesn't know what to do
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
She used to cry, now she's back in the pen
A human war between women and men

[Kid Capri]
Melodie, Kid Capri

[Verse 8: Jam Master Jay and DMC]
Jam jay on the way, yo
Human Education Against Lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
Get paid, get it made
Get a good grade, live to a very old age
Checking out jet, no disrespect
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
Is yes, listen to the messages and I send some
We never knew where the poison came from
Yo, we're rapping on H.E.A.L. so we thought we like to mention
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, we're here to make you get wise
Human Education Against Lies

[Kid Capri talks][Verse 1]
I am woman, hear me roar
When I grab the mic it's never a bore
When I'm on stage, sayin' a rhyme
I often wonder what ya think of mine
Is it fresh or weak, or is it live or dead?
Yo, it's got ta be somethin' if you're boppin' your head
To the beat, can I get an amen brother?
Liked that rhyme? Well here goes another...

[Hold up, hold up, hold up. Check it out. Before we go any further we
Gotta announce who we are. I am DJ K-Rock and this is my homegirl, MC
Lyte. Kick it for 'em!]

[Verse 2]
We had to pause for station identification
Now ya know my name here's some more information
Well, let's see, what you wanna know about me?
MC L-Y-T-E
[The Queen] Nah, that's too corny
[The Sexy] Nah, that gets the guys too horny
[The Best] Now that sounds conceited
But what is true is true, so it has to be repeated
The best is Lyte, when I'm on the mic
And MC's look straight ahead cos this pitch'll make your neck tired
And I say loosen up and relax
The fiction you been livin' I'mma fill with facts
Right now...

[MC Lyte, DJ K-Rock. Name of the group is Me and My DJ. Kickin' it
Live in '88. Do it.]

[Verse 3]
I am woman, hear me roar
Comin' out fresher and flyer than I did before
That's right, I'm well respected
Don't get stupid, I'm well protected
If ya wanna battle I'm well prepared
Me and K-Rock are far from scared, you know what
We're brave, livin' in a cave of gold
Waitin' for the misbehaved to get bold
But as I look around so far so good
MC's behaving just like they should
Hands are folded, no whispering or passing notes
All attention to me ya have to devote
I'm like a teacher, but then again not quite
Cos a teacher's salary I'm makin' a night
On the mic rhymes witty and bright
Maybe that's why the name is Lyte
Yo, bust it, I'mma end it right here
DJ K-Rock, you end it over there[ VERSE 1 ]
I used to be in love with this guy named Sam
I don't know why, cause he had the head like that of a clam
But you couldn't tell me nothin, cause Sam was number one
Cause to me, oh my gosh, he was one in a million
I shoulda knew the consequences right from the start
That he'd use me for my money, and then break my heart
But like a fool in love I fell for his game
But I got mine, so I show no shame
In Empire winked his eye, and then he kept walkin
And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin
The roller disco where we all used to go
Just to have some fun back in 1981
You know the place, Empire Boulevard
Is where I first saw the nigga, and he tried to play hard
But I knew the deal, cause I knew his brother Jerry
And Sam, he just broke up with his girlfriend Terry
So Jerry introduced Sam and I that night
He said, "Hello, my name is Sam" I said, "Hi, my name is Lyte"
We dipped and we dapped and we chit and we chat
About this and that, from sneakers to hats
He said, "Look, I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me"
(Let's go) To my house, lay back and get nice
Watch television, Reunite On Ice
I said, "Slow down, I know you wanna shake me down
But I'm not one of the girls to go rippin around"

(Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next month I finally went to his house
I walked into the door, there was a girl on the couch
I said, "Who's the frog, the bump on the log?
You chump, you punk, how could you do me wrong?
Singing sad songs about your love is so strong"
You said, "Wait Lyte, you're confused, the girl is my cousin"
Your brother agreed, but later she said that she wasn't

(Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand U)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Forgotten, next month we went to the Deuce
Well, I thought it kinda strange cause you had lots of juice
You knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Asked ya how you met em, said you met em at a party
Then these girls tried to tell me you were sellin the stuff
I said, "It's not your business, so shut the fuck up"
They said, "Okay Lyte, think what you wanna think
But it's gon' be some shit when your man becomes a fiend"
I said, "Look, to bust a move, I don't even know you
To put it Lyte, I really don't care to"
They kinda got mad and sort of offended
They said, "We only lookin out for yo best interest"
I said, "Thanks but no thanks" in an aggravated tone
"When I wanna find out, I find out on my own"

(Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand U)

[ VERSE 4 ]
Then my cousin said she saw you with this lady named C
Well I'm clawin my thoughts, I wonder who she could be
You're spending all your time with her and not a second with me
They say you spend your money on her and you're with her night and day
Her name starts with a C and it ends with a k
I strain my brain lookin for a name to fit this spellin
But I just couldn't do it cause my heart kept yellin
Burning, begging for affection from you, Sam
But just like a test I cram to understand you
Thought I knew you well enough to call you a man
But (Just like a test
Ju-just like a test
Ju-just like a test
I cram to understand you)

[ VERSE 5 ]
Then it came a time you started looking kinda thin
I asked you why, you said, "Exercise, tryina stay slim"
I bought it, even though I knew it was a lie
Cause it really didn't matter, you were still lookin fly
But oh no, oh no, you started askin me for money
Butter me up, beg me and call me your honey
So I gave you 2 yards, and then I gave you one more
You picked up your jacket and you flew out the door
You came back an hour later and you asked me for a 10
I said, "I only got a 20", you said, "Give me that, then"
I said, "Nope, I'll tell you now, you better stop slobbin
Find you a job, or you better start robbin"
So I stepped off with a giant step
Picked up my belongings, and I just left
And now I see you in Empire every Sunday
Juicin the girls up for some money and a lay
But every time I see you doin it, I just ruin it
Tell em how ya on crack, smoke, sniff, and chewin it
And as for this girl, Miss C, oh well
I was shocked as hell when I heard, Samuel
When your homeboys told me, I almost went wack
That the girl you was addicted to, her name was Crack[Verse 1]
[P]Uhm, what's up baby? I been eyeing you
Time and time again, I been trying to
Get a little closer, but you won't let it
[L]Well if I see something I want, I just go out and get it
I'm like a fluzy I'm choosy and I don't fall for tricks
Cause guys be running games, like the New York Nicks
[P]But on the square dear, you know, your style really temps me
[L]Don't try to gas me up on a tank that is empty
[P]I'm Positive, and I'm kicking the facts
[L]Well I'm Lyte, and you got to kick it better than that
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having

[Hook]
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me miss
[L]No, I'm not havin' it
[P]Excuse me?

[Verse 2]
[P]You think you're all that [L]No you think you're all of this
With your baby, baby talk, and your "Excuse me miss"
[P]Well I smooth, and hey look, it's only right
I thought that we could get together, and maybe we can ...
[L]Yeah sounds good, but guys like you just wanna hit and run
Look, we're not the two, and I'm not the one
So if ya got some thought of taking me to bed
Kill that! And get a five dollar crack-head
[P]But I'm all the way live, but I'm definitely not crabbing
[L]There are just certain things I'm just not having

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[P]I think you try to diss me or play me like I'm cooly
[L]No, matter of fact love, I think that you're a cuty
There's just certain things you don't understand baby:
Every woman wants to be treated like a lady
[P]So what? You want me to kick it as if I'm a doc?
[L]Listen to what I'm saying and shut ...
I'm just tryna put it, so I can make something happen
You just turned me off by the way that you was gabbling
[P]Look I'm all the way live and I'm definitely not crabbing
A bit of change for a woman, that's what I'm not having

[Bridge]
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]Step to yourself, cause I don't wanna hear it
[L]I keep feelings inside, I know who I am
[P]You're not getting younger, you're just getting older

[Verse 4]
[L]What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lots of pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
Friend. I'm never gonna fall in love again
But getting back to the topic of convo
In my book hone, you are a no-no
[P]C'mon I'm clean, cut, and dabber, you got to admit that
I don't sell drugs and I ain't with the wack track
I'm cool and calm, my phone is mine
You don't see me snatching taste, and acting wild
Excuse me miss, I think you better get with this
[L]Scan it damn, cause I'm simply not having it

[Hook]Our love is old-school like Mary Jane's
Boston baked beans and candy canes
Exchange a look on the number two train
Run catch kiss sunshine or rain
Jackson 5, Good Times, The Jeffersons
Yeah Baby, you know I liked it better when
You lived closer, but then you moved
But that couldn't stop our groove
My magic-man, my Brooklyn-boy wonder
I rub your shoulders if pressure you was under
Late night rides out to sunrise
Catch a flick or two and then back to Bedstuy
You in the bubble goose me in the sheep skin
Cold as hell back then it wasn't mattering
Long as we were hand in hand your my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world

*Chorus* (Gina Thompson)

This is for all the years you've been
My companion as well as my best friend
So tonight Baby I'm giving you what you want
It's all yours

Our love is like a Romeo and Juliet flick
So surreal but yet picturesque
There were problems I can admit
But we handled it and still the candles lit
So glad that we didn't just jet
Cause now we reaping the benefits
Who would have thought?
The cute little boy from down the street
Would fall in love with me
It's like a number one dream come true
To have somebody you love, love you
And that's all that matters
Is that we grow together make sure we never shatter
You're the reason I live
Because I want you to get all that I got to give
Long as we're hand in hand you're my man I'm your girl
Ready to conquer the world

*Chorus*

Our love is mystical like galaxies you can't touch
Around the world and back again I love you that much
Our love is destiny like Bonnie and Clyde
We'll die of old age side by side
Throughout the days I remain truthful
I keep it tight for you sexy and youthful
I told my mom when our days are through
If you have to go first bury me next to you
What I feel is unexplainable, 'I love you'
Just ain't enough to say to you
You've been there from the beginning to the end
My companion as well as my best friend
You got my heart now, here's my life
Yes I'm ready to be your wife
From here one know that you're the one

Everything you want it's done

*Chorus*[Verse: Brandy]
Oh yeah ooh yeah
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
Cause when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on

[Verse: Mc Lyte]
Yeah I get exotic with the melodic tune
I get hypnotic with the moon
But you got to put me down soon
I flip a sideshow if you come my way
Up, down, and around, even sideways
I'm about as ready as the Lyte can get
We can go all out
I ain't afraid of the sweat, but yet
I bet you got the techniques
To freak a girl inside out
What's that all about? (oooh yeah)
Can I have some of that?
You gotta put me on
Word around town is you're nine men strong
I wanna be put on in the worst way
Since the first day
I think it was a Thursday (oh baby)
You be that brother that I wanna sink my teeth in
Make me wanna ask “Where da hell you been?”
I like the way you be with all that personality
But I got flava too
You needs to get with me

[Hook: Brandy]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter the time
Of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Verse: Yo-Yo]
He was born twenty years ago
Just a pimp toes
Everyday new clothes
Look at the cut? Cool. Pose
On three, got tha heat, so bluff it
Sling' (censored) cause it's more than twenty duckets
Struck it, kinda rich
Now his pockets lookin' straight
Slam the deese on the Benzo
Pancake by the gate
Moms lookin' straight with her house she got
Great loungin' in her new home that's up out the state
I'll be your call mail, won't tell
You can get it when you want it
Even though you got chicks all up on you it
Don't matter, cause brother you're fly
I can't lie
I've been mackin' daddy from the corner of my eye
Now, baby bring it on
Don't be frontin' on your baby boo
All I wanna is what's up with you
How can I get with you
Seems like you got a hold on me
It must voodoo cause baby I want you

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse: Queen Latifah]
About yay short, about yay tall
About so big, about so small
About this length, about this width
About this flow, about this gift
Instinct leading me right up your alley way
Skip tha Moet, let's chill with some Alize
Nuff stress in our day
Let me massage your mind as my mental starts to play
A ghetto star's who you are
And I'll be your sexual chocolate bar
And I got to keep it strong for the cause
And you got to keep me strong for the tours
Brotherman and me, damn the family
What else could we be if no one understand us but we?
You were the first to tame me
Uh, Big Tif
I'm out

[Repeat Hook]

[Outro: Queen Latifah]
Hey here we go here we go here go now and it's on yeah
And you don't stop Brandy is in tha house and you don't stop
Until the body rock keep it on and you don't stop rock on[Intro] [MC Lyte]
This struggle continues (x2)

[Chorus]
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

[Bob Marley]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last

Nobody can stop us now, we need to [?]
We can't be bought nor sold
You can pay alright [?] your children every night
Life is much more than gold

[Chorus]
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

[Bob Marley]
The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte]
We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don’t really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]
J-A double M-I-N
We be jammin from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jammin in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I ‘naw be no rap star
Exodus when i bust
See the struggle i must
Realize it ain't just
But whats next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jammin (yes)

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
We be jammin
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
The struggle continues

[Bob Marley]
Jam’s about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can’t resist
So jam by my side
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
And we’re jammin in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
We’re jammin right straight god (from god)
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Yes, (Iya)
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We jamming (Know the man behind the name)
Hope you like jamming too[Verse 1]
B-boy where the fuck you at
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Who's body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

[Hook]
Keep on, keeping on cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new, keep on keep keeping on
Doin it right, right, right

[Verse 2]
Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
I guess I can, can I why not
If I wanna guess I can, can I
More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I procede to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

[Hook]

Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me, hurt me then dessert me
You better work me while you got the oppurtunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sigh your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game

[Hook]
